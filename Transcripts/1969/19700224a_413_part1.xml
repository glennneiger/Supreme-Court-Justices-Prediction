            <label>Mr. Roger A. Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="22.706" offset="194226">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.654" offset="210004">This is an action for alleged libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.377" offset="220871">Petitioners are a small community newspaper, the Greenbelt News Review and its president.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.218" offset="244276">The respondent, Bresler is a major builder/developer in Greenbelt whose building activities there have previously received wide publicity as to their importance and magnitude in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.795" offset="298506">Mr. Bresler had numerous dealings with the city council and other government agencies in an effort to get their approval for his zoning plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.231" offset="336332">And his counsel conceded in his opening statement that Mr. Bresler was a public figure in Greenbelt.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.227" offset="360260">Also during this period, he was a member of the state legislature and later a candidate for comptroller of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.914" offset="387009">No actual damages were shown or claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.904" offset="402996">The jury verdict was entered for $5,000.00 compensatory damages, $12,500.00 punitive damages which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.893" offset="442911">Two of the three articles which the Court of Appeals relies upon to support this judgment are accurate reports of public debate that two city council meetings, two Greenbelt city council meetings regarding Bresler's proposal to the city in which he tried to pressure the city into supporting his request for higher density zoning for a large tract of land in the center of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.159" offset="551999">He did this by saying that he would agree to sell another tract which he owned in the city and unfortunately the school board wanted -- which the school board want to build a school which the city desired, he would sell that only if the city agreed to his zoning request.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.961" offset="627231">Otherwise, he would insist on lengthy condemnation proceedings which would delay construction of a high school site.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.117" offset="655862">Now, the first of the two articles relied upon by the Court of Appeals is in the joint appendix at page 211 and if I may since it's so critical to my argument, I would like to go through that article just the key points shortly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger A. Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="196.548" offset="889605">I am resting on the record, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.645" offset="901935">Going to the article that forms the basis of this suit, the article is entitled School Site Stirs up Council, Rezoning Deal Offer Debated.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.637" offset="949896">Article makes clear that the -- the article is now discussing a proposal to the city council and the debate on that proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.407" offset="981034">The first paragraph of the article, delaying construction of a new Greenbelt high school is the lever by which a local developer is pressuring the city to endorse his bid for higher density rezoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.806" offset="1030562">So citizens were told at a crowded meeting in the city council.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.058" offset="1047594">The next two paragraphs explain how the school board had previously been trying to get the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.925" offset="1079045">And at the top of the next page or the fourth paragraph in the article, the proposal, Bresler's proposal to the city council is fully and accurately set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.238" offset="1132335">It's only at that point after it's clearly established in the article that the conduct being criticized is the proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.740" offset="1166294">The proposal is set forth clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.522" offset="1177475">The fact that it was publicly made is set forth and the fact that what was involved here was merely a threat to use his legal right to delay the condemnation edges, the right of any landowner to insist upon a condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.713" offset="1234213">It's only at this point that the article begins to describe the very hostile public reaction, the city council meeting to this proposal and the sixth paragraph, that accurately reports that a number of people at the meeting accurately characterized -- I mean a number of people has just been actually -- excuse me, the article accurately reports that a number of people at the meeting characterized this proposal as an attempt to blackmail the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.361" offset="1376841">The -- looking on the sixth paragraph, it says, it seems that this is a slight case of blackmail commented Mrs. Marjorie Bergemann and the word was echoed by many speakers from the audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.958" offset="1415189">Immediately after that reference to Mrs. Bergemann, a city councilman was quoted as saying that it's not blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.386" offset="1440893">He preferred to call it just two-way negotiations and the article goes on and lists other criticisms of the thing and the following comment demonstrates exactly what the people at the council meeting objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.766" offset="1494392">He said, “Everybody knows there is a need for a school.”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.802" offset="1506617">The developer knows there is a need and says, “We'll meet your need if you meet our need.”</text>
            <text syncTime="356.352" offset="1528769">That's what the people were referring to when they were referring to this article as blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.662" offset="1549981">The second article is much the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.442" offset="1557191">It's the report of a second city council meeting and at which there was further debate on the same proposal and the city council finally voted four to one to reject that.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.366" offset="1596792">In that article, another participant is quoted the same, “Fight Bresler's blackmail” in an attempt to tell the city to vote the proposal down.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.718" offset="1630229">Right after that --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="383.285" offset="1636498">Where is that in the record?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="384.673" stopTime="472.698">
            <label>Mr. Roger A. Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="384.673" offset="1642036">That would be on page two, 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.491" offset="1661367">And right after that, another participant debate is quoted as saying that, “This isn't blackmail but the legitimate advance in Mr. Bresler's right to advance his rights to develop his land.”</text>
            <text syncTime="405.148" offset="1723956">Now, the decision below rests on the proposition, the incredible proposition I believe that these articles charged Bresler with the crime of blackmail and the petitioners knew they were charging him with the crime of blackmail and there was no evidence that anybody interpreted this article as charged in a crime of blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.782" offset="1826461">Bresler could identify no one who read the articles that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.186" offset="1840149">He couldn't explain why he himself claimed that they charged him with a crime of blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.468" offset="1865226">He couldn't explain what conduct he was supposed to have been charged with that would constitute the crime of blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.234" offset="1888319">Nor was he able to explain why he ignored the articles for nine months until he brought this $2 million libel suit at a time when he was in the midst of his campaign for state comptroller and the news review was accurately criticizing his disregard of certain land covenants and his misrepresentations to the city council in connection therewith that -- on another matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.899" offset="2570951">If the jury found that, my position here is that there is insufficient evidence from which they could make that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.781" offset="2602506">Moreover there is no evidence that the petitioners intended this strained meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.100" offset="2631764">The only evidence relied upon by the Court was petitioner's testimony that the word blackmail in another context could charge the commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.297" offset="2676590">And that there was nothing at the meeting which indicated that Bresler committed the crime of blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.572" offset="2701667">Now, the Court of Appeals concluded on that testimony alone which assumed that the petitioners intended to charge a crime didn't -- there was no evidence, they just assumed that, that it would difficult to conceive of a case in which there was more convincing evidence that appellants had knowledge of a falsity of the charge or in fact entertain serious doubts.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.585" offset="2813680">This holding I submit is nothing less than a mockery of the New York Times role.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.064" offset="2835623">You can't establish falsity much less knowing falsity by taking a word out of context and ascribing to a meaning -- ascribing to it a meaning that is wholly different from that which it cont -- it's context dictates.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.857" offset="2906781">No one I submit reasonably can conclude from this article that the petitioners intended to charge Mr. Bresler with the crime of blackmail which was defined to the jury in the Court's instructions is the extortion of money by threats of criminal prosecution or embarrassment, threats of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.259" offset="3016391">The article by making it clear what conduct that Bresler was being criticized, what that conduct was, that it was publicly made, a proposal publicly made in the city completely negates any reasonable finding that the crime of blackmail was charged or that the petitioners intended the crime -- the charge --</text>

            <text syncTime="895.476" offset="3685230">The only other article and issue which the Court relies on the support of this verdict is an article entitled Charles Bresler to Run for State Comptroller and it listed on the eve of his announcement as a candidate for state comptroller, lists his dealings in the community and there's a statement in there that a number of homeowners had started legal proceedings against him for failure to make construction corrections in accordance with county standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.536" offset="3813543">Now, the basis for this article was clearly set forth in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.034" offset="3831515">15 to 20 homeowners at a public meeting told the news review's reporter after a public meeting, told the news review reporter that they had gone to their lawyers and they had filed complaints with county officials regarding their homes which the reporter interpreted as starting legal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.405" offset="3908942">Many of these people were personally known to the reporter, Mrs. Skolnick or they -- she recognized them as residents of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.374" offset="3948857">She'd has also previously heard similar complaints from other people in the developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.938" offset="3971114">All of the homeowners with whom she talked identified Bresler as the builder that -- with whom they were dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.982" offset="4007267">Bresler himself conceded that he'd received a number of complaints and that he responded to those complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.555" offset="4037569">Moreover, it subsequently turned out that one suit had been filed and two suits were subsequently filed, they got three suits were subsequently filed against corporations in which he was a principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.196" offset="4080201">Now, the claim of falsity here is very narrow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.922" offset="4143104">Now, the gist of the article of course that a number of homeowners, substantial number of homeowners in the community were complaining about defects in his homes, that was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.625" offset="4185840">The trial court paid little attention to this article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.239" offset="4196289">He mentioned in his -- in denying the motion for a directed verdict that this article didn't bother him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.115" offset="4219800">The Court of Appeals, however, said that the failure by the reporter to check court records or to call Bresler before reporting this information was sufficient evidence to constitute a fining of recklessness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.453" offset="5161148">Also the Court refused to rule out near negligence as a proof of references.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.772" offset="5178493">I don't emphasize here these erroneous instructions because as I've pointed out, the three articles upon which the court relied, are clearly insufficient as a matter of law to permit recovery under the New York Times rule.</text>
