            <text syncTime="38.630" offset="257860">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.338" offset="268727">The nature of this case is one where the petitioner was convicted of a robbery charge, sentence to 10 years in the State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.756" offset="318360">The trial had been delayed for a period of eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.005" offset="343437">The case was duly appealed to the Florida District Court of Appeals, raising the constitutional question, the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.028" offset="387532">The issue in this case before this Court is whether the petitioner was denied the right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution United States to put this case in proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.411" offset="448972">This is a continuation of what developed in Smith v. Hooey.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.887" offset="478960">I would like to discuss the facts first as they're most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.972" offset="499231">28th of June, 1960, a robbery occurred in Gadsden County, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.995" offset="527339">On the 1st of July, 1960, a warrant for the petitioner's arrest was sworn at.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.540" offset="553566">At that time, petitioner was in the custody of the federal authorities on related charges of bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.338" offset="584704">The petitioner was in the jurisdiction of Florida from July until September 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.660" offset="630053">In September 1960, petitioner was transferred into the custody of the federal authorities and subsequently sent to Leavenworth Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.512" offset="669445">During the period from July until September 1960, the State of Florida made no effort whatsoever to execute the warrant other than to place it into the hands of the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.389" offset="728900">Several years expired and in October of the 29th, 1962, the petitioner filed a written demand with the Circuit Court of Gadsden County requesting that he be brought back to Florida or that the charges be dismissed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.043" offset="799535">The court in an order denied this request stating that there was no authority upon the State of Florida to return petitioner to Florida to stay in trial since he was detained in federal custody, and that he was there because of his own doings.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.208" offset="884172">Petitioner subsequently filed two more written demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.986" offset="899323">He filed one in April 1963 and another in March 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.732" offset="934327">After that, the petitioner filed original mandamus proceedings in the Florida Supreme Court, and the Florida Supreme Court in a decision held that either Florida had to return petitioner to stay in trial or else to drop the detainer charges against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.372" offset="1004857">Petitioner then filed a motion to dismiss in September 1, 1967, requesting that the charges be dropped against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.285" offset="1048534">There was no action on this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.681" offset="1058147">The state in an ex parte order on December 15, 1967, obtained an order from the trial court having jurisdiction which ordered the petitioner back to Florida to stay in trial on January 23, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.833" offset="1126693">Petitioner was brought back into custody on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.060" offset="1139649">And on that date, an arraignment was held and he was ordered to trial on that Friday, but over objection of counsel, the trial was continued until January 31, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.092" offset="1195760">On January 30, 1968, the petitioner filed two motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.740" offset="1226376">The first motion was a content motion for a continuance based upon the fact that he was unable to locate two defense witnesses; one by the name of Dolan who would have cooperated certain testimony that he had been in the place that had been robbed, and another by the name of Strickland who would have testified that on the night that the robbery occurred in Florida that the petitioner was in Waycross, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.310" offset="1348629">The court granted the motion for continuance, and on the same date, the petitioner filed a motion to quash the information based upon the fact that he had been denied the right of speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.907" offset="1402964">The court withheld ruling on this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.434" offset="1413099">He also filed with the motion an affidavit stating that one of his witnesses had died in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.135" offset="1447894">On February, the court then continued the trial of the case until February 13, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.372" offset="1476838">On February 12, 1968, the petitioner then filed another motion for continuance based upon the fact that one Strickland and aid by Strickland still could be not located.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.753" offset="1526366">By that time, the witness Dolan had been located, had been subpoenaed for the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.608" offset="1549772">The court on February 13, 1968 denied the motion to quash based upon the constitutional grounds and ordered petitioner to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.916" offset="1598986">During the course of the trial, the deputy sheriff who testified for the state, testified that he had destroyed the notes that he had taken down in connection with the description given to him by the victim when the robbery had occurred, which brings us to the contention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.086" offset="1699715">As we're dealing with the Sixth Amendment case and in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.930" offset="1743078">As I mentioned previously, this picks up where Smith v. Hooey left off decided by this Court last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.708" offset="1782157">Now, the general reasoning has been that where a person can show that there is prejudice to the defense, this has been sufficient to establish that the defendant would not get a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.932" offset="1867107">If in fact he could show that witnesses were dead or missing, that witnesses couldn't be gotten in time for the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.330" offset="1912665">Now, the State's contention is, in this case at one, they gave the petitioner a speedy trial, and two, there was no prejudice to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.532" offset="1957491">It is our position that there was a prejudice to the defense because of the eight-year delay because that a witness was unavailable to support the petitioner's contention, and three, that a witness had died, and four, that vital evidence had been destroyed not maliciously by the state, but simply because as the Deputy Sheriff said that he didn't know when this man would come to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.088" offset="2087685">Now, 20 year --</text>

            <text syncTime="735.672" offset="3046066">Now, the discussing the question of the prejudice in this case, we have not dwelt on this in any length because I think the decisions are apparent to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.544" offset="3125582">There's -- on page 17 and 18 of our brief, there are a number of decisions where there is shown prejudice to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.706" offset="3166229">Another argument may be made that assuming that all witnesses were present, would this still have been prejudicial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.374" offset="3216906">We contend it would've.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.223" offset="3224221">We contend that anytime there is a lengthy delay that the guilt determination process is eroded simply because of virtue of the fact that witnesses forget as the years pass what they're supposed to remember in order to testify to.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.802" offset="3302588">And obviously, the guilt that obviously the right of cross-examination is lost to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.465" offset="3329233">The trial itself literally becomes a mockery because the witnesses cannot recall events that had happened many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.822" offset="3378657">Now, in the case of Klopfer v. North Carolina, which was decided by this Court, the commentators have said that there has been no prejudice discussed in this case, but we do note that as noted by this Court in Klopfer that the delay which an accused is subjected to that his movement, his freedom of movement is curtailed, the suspicion that he committed the crime, that the community is actually interested in an early trial, and that these factors are sufficient among the others to show that there was prejudice and in this case to Mr. Dickey.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.464" offset="3593279">Now, I would like to point out that the respondent claims that the petitioner, Dickey, did not comply with the Florida statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.492" offset="3633298">Florida has on its books 91501 and 91502.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.847" offset="3658794">In 91501, if a person is free and he can demand trial in three terms of court, and if he complies with these statutory regulations and he is not brought to trial within three terms of court, then the charge is dismissed completely and forever barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.785" offset="3750536">Now, 91502 says the same thing except for a person who is in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.977" offset="3783241">Now, the State of Florida contends that the petitioner never complied with these statutes and we will agree with that and there is no argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.448" offset="3821171">But I would like to point out to this Court that when the petitioner filed his written demand with the court having jurisdiction the first time it was laid, when he filed his second demand, that he was right on time but that court then said, “We have no authority to bring you back from another jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="952.242" offset="3912391">So he was neither fished nor found.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.023" offset="3923466">He couldn't get the benefits of the Florida statutes that which the other people who were incarcerated and present in that state were entitled to and who could've had a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.020" offset="3963486">So I don't think the argument that he failed to comply with the statutes is sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.754" offset="4314363">The answer to this is that our office was appointed to represent the petitioner on January 23, 1968 at the time of arraignment, and the trial court at that time set the trial which was a matter of eight days later that we did not have the opportunity in which to raise these questions by writ of prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.159" offset="4411956">Now, I would like to point out to this Court that already, the trial court had determined that they weren't going to answer the question of whether there's prejudice in the defense when he filed his first written demand for a speedy trial.</text>
