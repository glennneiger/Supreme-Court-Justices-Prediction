            <text syncTime="18.291" offset="176567">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court, this is a petition seeking review of an order of the Ohio Supreme Court denying the petitioner the right to take the Bar examination there which is a condition to admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.536" offset="285550">The petitioner was denied that right because of his refusal to answer three questions, a refusal based upon both First Amendment and Fifth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.648" offset="349915">Those questions appear at the bottom of page five and the top of page six of the petitioner's brief. Question 12 (g), “States whether you have been or presently are a member of any organization which advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.548" offset="457540">If your answer to any section of the above question is yes, set forth the facts in detail.”</text>
            <text syncTime="96.730" offset="490245">Question 13, these are on two questionnaires says, “List the names and addresses of all club, societies or organizations of which you are have been a member.”</text>
            <text syncTime="113.398" offset="557014">And question seven at the top of page six says, “List the names and addresses of all club, societies or organizations of which you are or have been a member since registering as a law student.”</text>
            <text syncTime="128.370" offset="616887">I should say that the petitioner had been admitted to the New York Bar were then in Ohio working for a branch of the office in the economic opportunity and had applied for admission to the Ohio Bar.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="148.017" offset="695463">Quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.727" offset="698284">If he had been a member of the Ohio Bar for a certain number of years he could have been admitted on motion I think, is that still true?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="155.877" stopTime="458.523">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="155.877" offset="726915">Now, when he appeared before -- when he got this question he declined to answer those questions on the application form on the ground of what he said was the Fifth Amendment and all of us have assumed that that meant for that stage privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.547" offset="813537">Subsequently, in meetings with the character committee members, he indicated that he was also relying upon the First Amendment and that he regarded the questions that were put as not pertinent to it's qualifications as a member of the Bar -- to be a member of the Bar. and when the character committee or the members of the committee eventually wrote their reports, they prayed very strongly the impression that this young man had made on them in their interrogation and one of them said that if the rest if the committee would not the mind the fact he hasn't answered these questions I would have recommend it as admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.063" offset="1003604">But the committee decided not to recommend his admission -- that is his admission to the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.439" offset="1033174">And at that stage while the matter was appearing, was before the Ohio Supreme Court he retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.742" offset="1066297">And counsel wrote to the Ohio Supreme Court, pointing out that the petitioner had raised First and Fifth Amendment grounds and that a recent decision of Judge Friendly in what we call the LSCRRC case, the Law Students Civil Rights Council case now pending in this Court at 696 and the recent decision by a statutory court headed by Judge Friendly questions of this very type were found by the statutory court to be improper and to impinge upon First Amendment rights and I will develop shortly the respects in which Judge Friendly found questions to this kind to be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.296" offset="1280606">And the counsel suggested the desirability of appearing before the Ohio Supreme Court arguing the matter instead of the Supreme Court upheld the committee and to then order appearing at page 56A of the appendix denying the application of Mr. Stolar to appear before the Bar -- to take the examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.695" offset="1386141">Now, we -- as I indicated before I am reasonably satisfied to the extent that the council could ever be could prevail in this Court on the grounds indicated by Judge Friendly and in the LSCRRC case and I will turn to those when I address myself specifically to the questions put by Ohio to Mr. Stolar.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.413" offset="1481017">We think, however, that there are more important problems, more fundamental problems relating to the entire question of political qualifications if I may use that term for the moment, to admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.091" offset="1543711">And it's for that reason our first point, in our submission is that political belief and political association and political advocacy of any kind are not proper conditions or grounds for this qualification to admission to the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.304" offset="1680593">As I say I realize the burden that I'm faced in presenting that proposition in the light of several cases in the Court for the assumptions underlining those cases but I want to address myself to that before I begin my argument on the second and third point which are that the test and the questions and the procedures followed by Ohio in this particular case violates the rule of precision which has been set down by this Court in a large series of cases in the last five or 10 years where the First Amendment rights may be impinged upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.847" offset="1866794">And my third argument is going to be very brief and that will relate to the right to assert the privilege against self-incrimination and answer the questions put by a character committee.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="479.264" offset="2020394">I am suggesting that too and I will come to that at the last page as I am suggesting the right to assert privilege there.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.102" offset="2051741">I want to suggest very briefly because we have elaborated on our brief and that we'll require a -- we hope a reconsideration by the Court of some of the assumptions in Konigsberg and Anastaplo despite the fact that they effectuate distinguished by the element of the question of Communist Party membership which one reason or another has been regarded as sui generis in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.268" offset="2164485">I want to turn to the first proposition which is that it seems to us that those -- that a political test and I may suggest even out conduct which is unlawful, although, obviously we don't have to go that far here, is not related at the proper functions of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.661" offset="2270020">Now, yesterday it as suggested by some members of the Court that the fact that some political activities might be protected against criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.850" offset="2318817">Mr. Justice Stewart, I think made a point deciding when Brandenburg against Ohio was mentioned does not necessarily mean that the persons engaging in those activities protected against criminal prosecutions are proper to admissions to the Bar and I wish to suggest that a reading of Keyishian and of Elfbrandt and Robel and Schneider against Smith which we have cited and quoted from in our brief suggest the contrary that those cases emphasized a point and in dealing with what we think with all due respect at least a sensitive and more sensitive occupations and membership of the Bar, namely work in a defense plant, work as a teacher with the young, work on in a merchant marine and in all of those cases the Court has said that these are constitutionally protected activities and the constitutionally protected activities cannot be a ground for disqualification from employment. Now, our submission here and I don't think it has been fully argued obviously on this argument I can't argue with fully either is that the profession of the law is a profession where these standards are less applicable for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.316" offset="2732596">First, it is a lawyer is of course not an employee of the State and whatever power the State has over its employees should not be applied to the lawyer and we think to the aspirant lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.522" offset="2797484">The second is it is difficult to conceive precisely what function it is as a lawyer that would be adversely affected by a political viewpoint or to go with political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.746" offset="2874389">It seems to us that there is a difference between the questions of a good private character, to go back to ex parte Garland phrase which we quoted in our brief and the question of a bad public character -- a question of a public character which is involved in the questions of conception of whether or not the State should be overthrown by force and violence to take the extreme situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.545" offset="2985566">In other words, the history of life in this country and in the world generally had shown that the most honorable persons have had conceptions and that sometimes attempted to carry up those conceptions into action.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.969" offset="3055261">In the political field, without in the slightest way reflecting upon their good character except when they have failed, I suppose, and without if there being any suggestion of the question of moral servitude and I think back specifically to the case of ex parte Garland where is through the Court based its decision on under the rubrics or on the principles of Bill of Attainder and of ex post facto law and yet in that case and in Cummings against Ohio we were dealing with the most serious of political crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.166" offset="3232057">We were dealing with matters described I think by Mr. Justice Miller's dissent as reasonable activities by Mr. Garland who, after engaging in the fight against the union on behalf of them sedulously, was admitted Bar here or retained his membership for the Bar, I should say and eventually became the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.993" offset="3351385">Now, In short --</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.582" offset="5025729">The questions that we have in this case questions two and three those dealing with all organizations are questions which the Court has really held improper in Shelton against Tucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.511" offset="5101380">It held that they go so far as to discourage all political associations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.560" offset="5145579">And Judge Friendly pointed out Your Honors will see in the appendix in this case Judge Friendly pointed out that the New York Court, I think Mr. Justice Harlan probably was aware of that same questions that was put earlier had withdrawn such question with respect to membership at all organizations and at withdrawing them because of what Judge Friendly said the awareness of the need to bring them in line with developing concepts of First Amendment rights and he referred specifically to Shelton against Tucker and Schneider against Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.127" offset="5307852">Now, question number one the question relating to membership in an organization advocating the overthrow of the Government has defects that I think were recognized in some of the questions here and that Judge Friendly pointed out, they omit the absence of knowledge concerning the purposes of the organization, they omit the absence of congruence that is membership at the same time that the organization had these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.315" offset="5436583">In addition to the two points made by Judge Friendly, which resulted in New York changing its question to import, to include these two elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.219" offset="6576253">They are regarded as dissidents, they regarded as radicals and if I can suggest Your Honor well I have forgotten to mention here, Your Honor will notice in our briefs what happened when Mr. Stolar appeared before the committee and what the committee said to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.605" offset="6653785">They're not after having gone through this and the applicant's waiting to answer these generalized question of the fact of nature, Your Honors will see on page six of my brief that the committee pressed him into specific questions and answers and that eventually he answered that he had -- and these are the words from the committee “that he is not now and has never been a member of the Communist Party or any socialist party or of the students for a democratic society and that he has signed the standards of the United States preinduction army oath with respect to a list of organizations on the Attorney General's list.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.477" offset="6857331">In other words, the people who are engaged in work generally and who are members of the student organization after another are met by this kind of specific inquiry under Ohio's program and what reason is there that they should be asked, that a student should be asked whether he is a member of any socialist party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.866" offset="6946879">All of these arises as I say in the context of Ohio's program and all of these is bound to discourage young men from joining organizations, from joining student groups and what we are doing ultimately is we are letting the decisions to be made in these things as they must be made I suppose by character committees who makes for into First Amendment protected activities here and who live in a milieu which is so different from the young men who are in the law schools today and I have talked that recently in the law schools I have been amazed in the different quality of the laws students that exist today than those who existed even 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.130" offset="7151888">And these students should not be discouraged by questions that are of this kind and that are put by Ohio as to whether they are members of The Students for a Democratic Society assuming there is such a single organization today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.280" offset="7212492">They should not be discouraged by asking whether they are members of a Socialist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.586" offset="7233703">All of these arises and arises in the context, Your Honors will know, that nobody has made any determination such as the Court suggested in a different context that I think applicable here in Joint Anti-fascist against McGrath, a determination that an organization is an organization which one should not belong to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.849" offset="7326804">It gives a freewheeling suite to the committees to make this inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.326" offset="7344671">Now, with respect to the Communist Party although I have suggested that ought to be, should be reconsidered by the Court, the Court has pointed out repeatedly legislative findings, legislative hearings, judicial hearings and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.839" offset="7406738">But with respect to matters other than the Communist Party, then it certainly seems to me that somebody must have a hearing to determine whether an organization is on a particular, should be on a list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.003" offset="7463372">If list had to be permitted before we are to give committee the right to ask questions concerning that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.821" offset="8778689">And the Ohio Supreme Court treats both questionnaires as a complete application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.717" offset="8818291">On the second questionnaire, the petitioner refused for the same reason as on the first questionnaire to answer a question about the membership in club, societies or organizations since the period registered as a law student.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.571" offset="8881612">After being duly warned, duly warned of the effect upon the investigation of a failure to answer these questions, the petitioner persisted in his refusal to answer and based upon this refusal, the Bar Admission Committee recommended to the Supreme Court of Ohio that the petitioner's application for admission to the Bar examination be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.593" offset="8965726">The Supreme Court of Ohio approved the recommendation of the Admissions Committee and denied the application of the petitioner to be admitted to the March 1969 Bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.768" offset="9014418">Petitioner has not raised an issue any quarrel with the right of the Supreme Court of Ohio to determine the qualifications of those who they would admit to the Bar including the moral fitness of such persons or such person who is to be entrusted with the faith of clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.921" offset="9091009">It follows, therefore, that the Supreme Court of Ohio does have a legitimate interest in investigating the moral character of its applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.817" offset="9118595">They consider it hand-in-hand a part or in parcel together with the technical qualifications for the admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.209" offset="9152240">And pursuant to this purpose, it must be appropriate to allow the Court to inquire into associations to the extent that the information acquired thereby maybe an aid of such legitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.259" offset="9208456">The function of the higher questionnaire, both questionnaires for that matter, is to provide the basic information as a guide in conducting the investigation of applicants nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.477" offset="9253282">There's no political test involved, there's no oath of loyalty involved, and there are no prescriptions in mere membership in any organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.422" offset="9301034">Now, the first of the petitioner's argument in this aggregate effect is really a conjecture as to what the Supreme Court of Ohio might do with the kind of information it seeks on these questionnaires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.714" offset="9358190">Not what it has done but what it might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.009" offset="9371460">We submit that it would be unfair to determine this case on the basis of the mere possibilities or potentialities of action by the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
