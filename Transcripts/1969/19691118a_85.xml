            <text syncTime="17.354" offset="172805">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.077" offset="187643">In the present case, this Court is called upon to resolve a direct conflict between the Courts of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the First Circuit regarding a threshold question of standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.709" offset="246157">Now, this case arose in the District Court for the District of Minnesota and it was dismissed upon motion and before trial on the grounds that the petitioners lack standing to maintain this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.626" offset="305925">This ruling was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and about the same time, a substantially identical case arose in Rhode Island and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reached a precisely opposite result that petitioners in that case do have standing to maintain this particular type of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.365" offset="404877">This case arose from the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.172" offset="412087">The First Circuit case is presently pending on petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.306" offset="436642">The facts in this case are limited to the complaint because the case was dismissed on motion prior to trial or pretrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.038" offset="471542">The petitioners were the plaintiffs and they are the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, which is a trade association of businesses engaged in rendering data processing services to the general business community.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.461" offset="537266">The other petitioner is Data Systems Incorporated, a Minnesota corporation, a member of the association, which is referred to as ADAPSO and Data Systems is engaged in rendering data processing services in the Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.785" offset="606542">Respondents are the American National Bank and Trust Company of St. Paul, a National Bank and the Comptroller of the Currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.049" offset="647607">The facts alleged that Data System was engaged in the data processing business in Minnesota and that the American National Bank was similarly engaged in the data processing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.988" offset="699329">And as a matter of fact, the Data Systems had agreed to perform certain services for particular customer, it later turned out that the customer began doing business with the American National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.193" offset="748126">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.375" offset="760874">The complaint alleged that the action of the American National Bank in performing data processing services was unlawful and that it violated the powers given National Banks under the National Banking Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.516" offset="817403">The complaint asked for declaratory relief that the bank’s action was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.377" offset="840913">It asked for injunctive relief and it asked for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.510" offset="857422">The complaint also asked for declaratory relief that the Comptroller of the Currency was acting unlawfully when he authorized National Banks to engage in the general data processing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.353" offset="912802">The Comptroller’s authorization is found on page 2 of petitioner’s brief and it’s in a paragraph of the Comptroller’s Manual for National Banks, which states as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.442" offset="961181">“Incidental to its banking services, a national bank may make available its data processing equipment or perform data processing services on such equipment for other banks and bank customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.891" offset="1022934">The last three words that if the banks assume authority to do this fatal activity.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="255.827" offset="1126693">So the question is the statutes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bert_m_gross" startTime="258.385" stopTime="762.627">
            <label>Mr. Bert M. Gross</label>
            <text syncTime="258.385" offset="1136933">That’s correct, the question is statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.157" offset="1160025">In our brief, we raise the general question of standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.012" offset="1179460">We have discussed the so-called the legal right theory, the requirement that a plaintiff must have a legal right to have standing to maintain an action of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.363" offset="1236825">This rule was probably most prominently announced in the case of Tennessee Electric Power versus TVA in 306 United States’ reports, but this was not the issue that divided the Courts of Appeals where the First and the Eighth Circuit and I would turn to that narrow issue which did divide the Circuits and that’s he question of statutory aid to standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.909" offset="1355003">The rule generally maybe stated that that if a competitor can show that a statute was intended to protect his competitive or economic interest then he has standing to complain of unlawful competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.068" offset="1423653">And we believe that the statute is applicable in this case, and that statute is the Bank Service Corporation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.257" offset="1456358">That’s found in 12 United States Code, Section 1864 -- the relevant portion is quoted in our brief at page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.073" offset="1495646">This is a 1962 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.802" offset="1510588">It is therefore extremely important to examine the legislative purpose of the Bank Service Corporation Act to decide the scope or the protection before the data processing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.086" offset="1571715">The basic purpose of the act is undoubted, it was to allow smaller banks to achieve more effective competition against larger banks by joining together to invest in bank service corporations subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.383" offset="1644857">Two or more banks that can now join together to form a bank service corporation which will render data processing services for the banks such things as sorting checks and reconciling statements that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.789" offset="1702536">Prior to 1962, it was felt that banks could not invest in corporations of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.430" offset="1733047">So the basic purpose was to authorize National Banks to join together in this function.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.731" offset="1762304">Now, the question that properly came up as to the extent that bank service corporations could engage in the general data processing of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.326" offset="1800652">And the compromise or result reach by the House of Representatives which have the bill initially was to permit bank service corporations subsidiaries to perform the services for a non-bank customers to the extent of one-half of their total activities, but not to exceed one-half of their total activities could be performed for a non-bank customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.228" offset="1908276">When the Bill got to the Senate, certain senators were not satisfied with even this restriction and a minority report was issued by the Senate Banking and Currency Commission or Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.284" offset="1964492">Senators Proxmire, Neuberger and Douglas issued the report criticizing the one-half limitation as being excessive, that’s found on our brief on page 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.071" offset="2023633">Excerpts from that report, I’ll read the Court one sentence and this is the basic point of the minority report.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.689" offset="2054144">They stated that adequate justification has not been demonstrated for extending this exemption to permit banks to engage in the business of data processing which this Bill permits up to 50% of the total activity of a bank service corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.739" offset="2130317">Senator Proxmire went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.820" offset="2142647">He introduced an amendment on the Florida Senate to prohibit bank service corporations totally from engaging in data processing services for non-bank customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.722" offset="2198235">And there could be no question as to the reasons for Senator Proxmire’s amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.263" offset="2220387">He was perfectly clear on the reasons and they were to protect the data processing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.447" offset="2245151">On page 35 of our brief, we have quoted from certain remarks of Senator Proxmire and I’ll read a few sentences so that the Court can see exactly what the senator was driving at with his amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.322" offset="2304711">He stated that banks have customer lists and they can offer their customers for instance for service of handling their receivables which would give the banks a substantial advantage over other legitimate long established business providing this kind of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.610" offset="2365837">A number of these businesses have informed me and other senators that this kind of competition would be very unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.967" offset="2395199">It would be unfair because the banks could use their own personnel charged merely the out-of-pocket cost and the unfair competition could drive businesses now offering this kind of service to the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="585.499" offset="2445354">These are the reasons why I offered this amendment with the adoption of the amendment, I think we are in a position to have a bill that provides what the banks really want, what the members of the committee feel is justified and at the same time safeguard legitimate business enterprises which might otherwise be put out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.218" offset="2532289">The Proxmire Amendment passed and the Bank Service Corporation Act is presently enacted in the law states as follows: no bank service corporation may engage in any activity other than the performance of bank services for banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.653" offset="2610030">We believe that this case requires in unique fashion and interpretation of the scope of the so-called statutory aid to standing a doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.016" offset="2655483">In previous cases, courts have been faced with the question of whether a statute was designed to protect the competitive interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.823" offset="2690696">If the statute was designed to protect the competitive interest, then the court held that the protected competitor had standing to maintain his litigation on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.774" offset="2738448">On the other hand, if the statute for constitutional provision was not so designed and was not intended to offer protection to competitive interest, then the competitors were held not to have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.128" offset="2787871">Or in this case, we have a situation that is not occurred before to the best of our research and the respondents cited no cases showing a situation where there is an undoubted congressional purpose to protect a competitive interest, but from a source of competition which is slightly different although closely related to the actual source of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.716" offset="2898213">Here, we’re dealing with competition by a National Banks themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.026" offset="2915453">The statute according to its words was -- says that no bank service corporations subsidiary shall engage in data processing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.789" offset="2962578">So, we have the situation where it appears to us that respondents are arguing this file.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.916" offset="2987029">Assume that Bank A and Bank B get together to form a subsidiary Bank Service Corporation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.145" offset="3015973">That corporation begins to engage in activities, which appear to be data processing for the general business community.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.326" offset="3048678">In that situation, we must assume that a competitor like the petitioner has standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.085" offset="3075741">However, assume that Bank A and Bank B instead of forming a subsidiary corporation decide on their own individually to offer the same type of data processing services.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.901" offset="3131016">The respondent says, “There is no standing because there is no statutory aid to standing.”</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="762.627" offset="3153899">Under your view of the standing issue, would you, would be not reach the merits namely the question of the authority that comptroller to authorize?</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="775.591" offset="3205726">A case should go back to the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bert M. Gross</label>
            <text syncTime="776.904" offset="3210951">A case would go back for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.242" offset="3224325">Now, we can assume that even further where the bank service corporation access that have two banks get together to form the subsidiary on one bank leaves and withdraws that the other bank -- the other individual bank may carry on with the bank service corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.417" offset="3289004">So, we have a situation of one bank having a bank service corporation subsidiary which if it engages in data processing activities now the petitioners can attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.527" offset="3337488">And yet, if the parent corporation engages in the self same activities, there is no standing according to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.995" offset="3375313">We feel that this is an effort by the banks and by the Comptroller of the Currency to adopt the very broad and expensive interpretation of the restrictive doctrine of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.851" offset="3426826">And we feel that they are pushing the doctrine of standing beyond any reasonable purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.531" offset="3449501">The rules of standing have the effect of preventing an inquiry into the merits of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.630" offset="3473847">And we feel that rules that have this effect of preventing reaching the merits should be rather narrowly and restrictively interpreted and in close cases, the doubt should be resolve in favor of reaching the merits particularly where the merits are important and the merits are important and not this type of bank case is important to the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.013" offset="3567470">It’s important to petitioners and it has important implications.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.231" offset="3604250">Your Honor, I feel that Flast v. Cohen shows a philosophy of standing that would grant standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.607" offset="3641762">The facts of course in the situation are different but Flast versus Cohen has a philosophy of inquiring into the personal interest of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.962" offset="3687215">It inquires into the concrete adverseness of the parties whether the case is informed in appropriate form for judicial resolution rather than seeking to find some undefined legal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.212" offset="3752208">If you look at the factual adverse interest, if you look at the type of case, if you look at our case through the view Flast and Cohen there clearly is standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.180" offset="3796093">These people are adverse under any test, petitioners have been harmed undeniably at this juncture of the case they have been harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.584" offset="3837680">They alleged they’ve been harmed and their complaint was dismissed before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.374" offset="3860877">The case is appropriate for a judicial treatment, we ask for the interpretation of a statute of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.222" offset="3892224">We think the competitors in this situation are the best persons to try the merits to this litigation and probably the only persons, we feel that the merits it’s unlikely that the merits will ever be reach if a competitor does not bring this type of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.683" offset="3962128">So, we feel that under Flast versus Cohen, we do have standing, we have adversity, we have this personal state, we have a concrete case, and in addition, we have important issues on the merits and finally we have a statute of Congress where Congress clearly was trying to protect the data processing industry from a type of National Bank competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.132" offset="4059930">This is what the First Circuit felt was sufficient for standing and this is what we believe this sufficient for standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.739" offset="4890311">Over a period of almost 90 years beginning with its decision in 1882 when Railroad Company against Ellerman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.457" offset="4929181">This Court has consistently in here to rule that where as is concededly the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.781" offset="4958542">There is no special statutory provision for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.761" offset="4982366">The complainant seeking to attack governmental action which does no more than increase competition against him or show that he possesses a legally protective right to be free from that competition, now the court has further made it clear that it is also true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.742" offset="5062301">No such legally protected right is conferred by license or franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.842" offset="5086751">The plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that as this Court put it just two terms ago in Hardin against Kentucky Utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.170" offset="5124054">The particular statutory provision invoked reflects a legislative purpose to protect the competitive interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.327" offset="5160730">If but only if such a purpose appears to again call it from Hardin, the injured competitor has standing to require compliance with that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.601" offset="5213811">Now, notwithstanding the present reliance petitioners upon the Bank Service Corporation Act to which I will turn in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.316" offset="5264593">The fact remains that its complaint invoked only the incidental powers clause of the National Bank Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.862" offset="5298866">Provision of 12 U.S.C. 247 which authorizes National Banks to exercise “such incidental powers shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.319" offset="5360619">Specifically, as petitioner’s complaint reflects their attack upon the Comptroller’s ruling that National Banks may provide data processing services to other banks and bank customers was based exclusively on the proposition that such services do not come within the purview of the incidental powers clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.600" offset="9357772">The purpose of the Bank Service Corporation Act was to enable banks to invest to these bank service corporations so that banks particularly small ones could combine to obtain the advantage of among other things automated facilities which individually they could not have purchased.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.300" offset="9512521">And I think that Representative Malter who is a senior member of the Banking of Currency Committee really admonished against the kind of approach which the petitioners advance here and the quotation which appears in the amicus curiae brief of the American Bank Association on page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.369" offset="9624848">I won’t read the quote, but he specifically indicates that he wants to make it abundantly clear that this Bill was not intended to go outside the very language appearing in the Bill and he goes on to say that it will not interfere with any authority now invested in banks and that it simply sets up a new means by which individual banks can acquire these additional services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.191" offset="9728188">Now, it was in part in parcel of the conferral of this benefit upon banks if this restriction was put in which was -- limits the bank service corporation to performing bank services for banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.633" offset="10005922">But even so the interest was reflected only in the context of the activities of the bank service corporation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.213" offset="10032253">Now, I wish to stress again that as said out in some length in the amicus brief of the American Bank Association there have been several bills for the Congress since 1962 in which they -- there has been in connection with which there has been a request usually spearheaded by ADAPSO that there be a prohibition directly impose on banks with respect to data processing service activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2567.094" offset="10371741">But the whole thrust really the majority views of the two committees is that this is an Act which is designed to legislate in the area of bank service corporations and not in any other area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.563" offset="10429628">And we think that it is really is not appropriate basis for carrying over this statute into another area and allowing it to be used as a statutory aid standing to question activity under a statute which was not intended to protect the competitor who has bring the challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.685" offset="10678105">Well, I meant to say was that that would be a much closer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.166" offset="10696077">There, if they well might be found to have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.589" offset="10709765">And on the other hand, there’s an argument at least that they would lack standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.259" offset="10732440">It was not a gain I wish to stress it’s a completely different situation than the one which is before the Court here where they are not invoking as the basis of complaint of the legality of that Act, some other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.034" offset="10795551">Now, I would only add have if the Court pleases that for the reasons that are detailed in our brief, we do not believe that there is any reason why this Court should suggest -- excuse me, should adopt the alternative suggestion of petitioners that the rule of Ellerman, Tennessee Power, and Hardin be discarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.338" offset="10920730">We think that that rule does not as petitioners suggest -- would suggest we think the rule does not leave the public interest unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.705" offset="10982170">We think what it does do is leave it to the Congress inappropriately so to determine where superintendence of the administrative action should be when those circumstances where the claimant can point to the invasion of no legally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.778" offset="11062523">We think that fundamentally what the role of the Court is -- the proper role of the Court is the -- that of a guardian of legally protected rights and interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.249" offset="11116335">We think that outside of that realm, it is perfectly appropriate for Congress to make the decision as to whether it wishes the courts to extend judicial review to those who’s like these petitioners it can claim solely aggrieved in the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.527" offset="11205465">Flast and Cohen Mr. Justice Harlan, we believe to be fully consistent with the standing cases upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.791" offset="11242559">In Flast and Cohen -- against Cohen, this Court held that in so far as the Article 3 requirement of the case of controversy is concerned that it was enough that there be a substantial personal state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.358" offset="11312776">But the Court there was confronted with a situation where there was obviously a legal right involved as the Court construed the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.177" offset="11364080">They -- that individual has a right legally protect the constitutionally protected right to be free from having his tax moneys expended for in the furtherance of a religious purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.863" offset="11430849">And I would only add that in just last June, this Court in Jenkins versus McKeithen, as the opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall specifically indicated referring to Flast against Cohen that something more than adversary interest is necessary to confer standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.788" offset="11518516">There must be an addition, some connection between the official action challenge and some legally protected interest party challenging that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.059" offset="11555610">And while Mr. Justice Marshall’s opinion again was for himself and two other justices as we read the concurring and dissenting opinions, there was no disagreement on this interpretation of Flast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.356" offset="11608795">And we would submit if the Court pleases that in this case, petitioners have not established requisite connection between the official action which they challenged the action of the Comptroller interpreting the National Bank Act and some legally protected interest which they possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.838" offset="11694686">And as so far as the National Bank Act is concerned as they admit themselves competitors have no legally protected interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.678" offset="11726033">For these reasons, we respectfully submit that the judgment of court below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2919.024" offset="11779427">If the Court please, we cannot agree that assuming that we have standing to challenge the action of a wholly-owned subsidiary of a National Bank that we do not have standing to challenge the identical activity of the National Bank itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.620" offset="11865840">We think that that cuts the doctrine of standing too fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.313" offset="11888619">As far as the legislative purpose of the Bank Service Corporation Act, the respondents have stated that we only have Senator Proxmire statements as to the purpose for Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.617" offset="11945880">But of course Senator Proxmire introduced this Section, he explicitly stated his reasons for doing so on and it was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.876" offset="11974928">There is another statement which we have quoted in the footnote on our brief at page 35 and this is from Senator Bush.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.449" offset="12005125">Senator Bush said, “I join with the Senator that is Senator Proxmire in supporting the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.521" offset="12029471">I think the Senator’s amendment is well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.393" offset="12040965">I think it is advisable to try the situation out at the bank level before we authorize banks to go into competition with other service organizations in providing the type of service kind contemplated here.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.096" offset="12147754">We’re presenting this only for a statement of the interest that was trying to be protected that they were trying to protect the competitive interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.483" offset="12177324">And this is what gives the standing, it is the congressional intent or purpose to protect competitive interest which gives the standing and we do not go into the merits at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.840" offset="12230719">As far as reaching the merits of the case and the question of whether or not the merits will ever be reached and who can reach the merits if we cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.048" offset="12271574">We frankly do not think that the Comptroller of the Currency is the -- is an adequate person to reach the merits to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.133" offset="12315878">Number one, he has already decided that the banks do have authority under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.283" offset="12344508">Secondly, and in a broader sense, there have been recently in the Court of Appeals six cases regarding entry by a National Banks into various areas of business endeavor which have not previously been considered traditional banking areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.797" offset="12418591">From these six cases, four cases of the Court of Appeals held standing, two they held no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.839" offset="12446699">Of the three cases that actually reached the merits, two of the three held that bank action was illegal and all these cases, this action was authorized by the Comptroller of the Currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.696" offset="12494137">So, on the merits the Comptroller is banning one out of three and the legality of bank actions and on these grounds, we think that judicial review is needed and this is a traditional function of the courts to decide the question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.108" offset="12563832">For these reasons, we repeat that we feel we do have standing in this case.</text>
