            <text syncTime="16.587" offset="169671">Mr. Bader you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walton Bader</label>
            <text syncTime="19.615" offset="181791">Thank Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.092" offset="199764">This case involves a patent license agreement which are centered into between the petitioner Standard Industries and the respondent Tigrett Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.000" offset="263398">The agreement provided that Standard Industries was to pay in effect a royalty of 5% of the covered product sales price which is the way the contract read.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.627" offset="329853">And the contract provided also the usual warranty of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.335" offset="356707">The patent was in fact in the name of Tigrett Industries, but the assignment was a conditional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.126" offset="391920">The agreement of assignment between Tigrett Industries and the inventor, provided that the assignment would become absolutely void if Tigrett Industries made an assignment for the benefit of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.347" offset="456808">Now on December 29, 1964 after this contract had been entered into, the Tigrett Industries assigned a patent involved to a subsidiary of the petition and known as Jackson Furniture Company which company is not a party to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.699" offset="542177">And that assignment provide that the Jackson Furniture Company, the purchaser agrees to abide by all the obligations terms and conditions of a semi herein Tigrett Industries Inc. as more specifically set forth in an agreement dated July 19, 1961 which was the original assignment that I've previously mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.016" offset="635486">Thereafter, on December 22 -- I'm sorry thereafter on April 26, 1965, Tigrett Industries did make an assignment for the benefit of creditors and it was the position of Standard Industries at that point that the agreement became absolutely void by recent of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.901" offset="734960">Standard Industries then failed to pay royalties in connection with the patent involved and a suite was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.093" offset="771741">And there were various claims that were made by Tigrett Industries before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.022" offset="791489">We don't have to go into those details.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.854" offset="798804">They sort reformation of a contract, sought royalties on every item that Jackson Furniture Corporation had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.899" offset="830986">But when the trial court got through, the trial court held that there were two items that was subject to royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.206" offset="864214">One known is the play around, the other known is the golden converter.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.321" offset="884694">Insofar as the play around is concerned, Standard Industries does not contest the validity of that patent or the coverage with respect to the patent applicable to the play around.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.613" offset="937775">However, Standard Industry does contest any coverage with respect to the patent involving the golden convertible.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.813" offset="974660">And that is the issue which I am going to address myself to for a few months.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.319" offset="1004648">It was conceded by the trial court and by the appellant court that the patent involved which is patent number 3,162,865 did not have any claim that specifically covered the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.564" offset="1093674">Because the claim of a patent, the broadest claim in the case required that they were had to be a pair of space openings in the base plate of the plate patent and that draw springs have to pass through this space openings.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.281" offset="1172459">The trial court however held that regardless of the fact that the terms of the claim did not cover the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.342" offset="1208717">Nevertheless, by reason of an application and I believe a misapplication of the doctrine of a equivalence as the law presently stands at the present time that this patent still read on the golden convertible structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.692" offset="1286144">Now I am not going to discuss in my argument whether -- in detail, whether or not the Court should announce a new doctrine with respect to the doctrine of equivalence?</text>

            <text syncTime="322.015" offset="1391470">I adopt the position taken by the Attorney General in the amicus brief Mr. Justice Stewart and I also wish to address some other remarks in connection with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.807" offset="1434624">Pointing out to the Court that the doctrine should be implicated because this doctrine is actually causing a break upon technology in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.822" offset="1482689">The reason is this, normally when a competitor wishes to go into a field where a company has a dominating patent position.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.540" offset="1525530">He will come to this patent accounts when he will say, “These are the dominating patents in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.344" offset="1552697">How can I avoid these patents?”</text>
            <text syncTime="366.229" offset="1568266">And what the patent attorney normally does, he studies the claims of the patents involved and attempts -- and through the engineers of the company involved and technical personnel attempts to create structures which will avoid the patented claims and these is what produces technical progress because the man produces a structure which in many cases is superior to the patent structure.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.868" offset="1806817">I submit to the Court that what the Court did was to abrogate the doctrine of equivalence for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.690" offset="1842134">There are two ways that we can -- you can claim a structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.488" offset="1857285">There is a what we call abstract claimology and there is concrete claimology and these things are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.588" offset="1909739">For example, if I wish to claim two gears which are meshing to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.737" offset="1934294">If I claim this concretely, I will say a pair of interconnected gears.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.079" offset="1959685">Now that is the method that is used by the Germans in claiming patents and in setting forth claims, and the Germans give a very worrying doctrine of equipments to such a structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.484" offset="2013288">That is a pair of gears would also cover a belt and a pulley.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.260" offset="2044426">But in our patent law, in view of the provision of the Patent Act of 1952 which permitted claiming of means plus a function.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.552" offset="2089566">I submit that Congress intended to permit abstract claims but with no doctrine of equivalence.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.391" offset="2316936">Well in -- Mr. Justice Burger in Halliburton versus Walker, the Supreme Court specifically rejected claims drawn to means plus a function.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.881" offset="2362911">And therefore with that decision on the books, it would be impossible to draw an abstract claim that would be held valid by the Court in view of the Halliburton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.006" offset="2411395">And the Patent Act of 1952 when they put in the illustration that claims could be made by means plus a function.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.417" offset="2464998">They did that in order to permit this type of abstract claim and I submit to the Court that since that now was no longer necessary to have a doctrine of equivalence in order to properly claim a subject matter that Congress by implication did say that the doctrine of equivalence no longer had any application.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.950" offset="2539186">And that is the petition disposition on that matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.595" offset="2637720">The petitioner does submit that the doctrine of equivalence in this case was misapplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.017" offset="2675440">This Court in the case of Graham against Deere which is the latest pronounced that I believe that this Court has made on the doctrine of equivalence has stated that where of a subject matter of a patent is narrowed that the doctrine of a equivalence likewise must be very narrowly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.167" offset="2764048">Furthermore, the doctrine of equivalence cannot be applied if there is what is called file wrapper estoppel in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.269" offset="2800410">That is if a patentee in order to obtain a patent, puts a limitation in his claims, he may not thereafter say that is a structure is infringing which does not utilize this limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.118" offset="2875852">And I submit that the file history of this case and the narrowness of the patent involved clearly indicates that the doctrine of a equivalence in this case has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.908" offset="2927052">I submit that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.809" offset="2938650">The invention -- and I will discuss the validity of the patent in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.953" offset="2963205">If the patent is valid at all, it involves a very narrow structure of being able to pull two draw strings through a whole in a base plate from the top rather than being able to do the same thing from the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.182" offset="3028093">That's the whole point of novelty in the case because there is a patent, a prior patent which is Adamson which shows the identical structure except that the draw strings are tightened from the bottom of the base plate instead of being tightened from the top of the base plate.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.474" offset="3193292">Two plus two when added together and they produce four.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.222" offset="3212309">Secondly, in the original case, the patently attempted to get one claim which was extremely broad and a second claim which involved two space openings in the base plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.956" offset="3275212">Now, we're only using one but this original claim called for two, I believe it was original claim for.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.199" offset="3308126">That claim was rejected by the patent office on references.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.183" offset="3328084">And the patentee then amendment the claim, to say two space openings in the base plate with draw strings passing through these openings and being connected at the top of the base plate for manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.429" offset="3381060">Therefore, the patentee specifically obtained his claim by means of two space openings.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.124" offset="3411884">He always requested from the patent office, two space openings and under those circumstances, the doctrine of equivalence has no application in view of the clear file wrapper estoppel in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.137" offset="3579904">The petitioner could not at that time contest the validity of the patent because the law in the Sixth Circuit at that time as set forth in the petitioner's brief was to the affect that a patentee, that a licensee could not contest the validity of the patent under which he was licensed but could only introduce prior add in order to attempt to limit the scope of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.096" offset="3691708">Under these circumstances obviously since that was the law in the Sixth Circuit, there was nothing that the petitioner could do to contest the validity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.193" offset="7200162">It seemed to us to be the matter of general public importance in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.702" offset="7230151">With the Court's permission, I would like to summarize briefly the historical setting which gave rise to that doctrine since the description of it in our brief is somewhat over simplified and I commanded the Court's attention of comprehensive study of this history not cited in the briefs entitled evolution of the claims if you ask patents by Carol B. Lutz, published in three parts in volume 20 of the journal of the patent office society in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.389" offset="7384900">While the doctrine of equivalence was first articulated by this Court in 1854 in 3025 it amounted to an elaboration of a general approach, the judges had been taken to the question at patent infringement from the earliest period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.948" offset="7455117">There was as the brief for the patent law association notes, no statutory requirement of claims in patent applications prior to the Patent Act of 1836, although the earlier statutes did require the patentee in a general way to distinguish his invention from all other things before now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.746" offset="7546337">And as a result of judicial interpretations of this general requirement claims began to be included in many patent applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.539" offset="7585520">And the 1836 Act under which 3114 was decided codified this practice in its provision quoted in the amicus brief of the association requiring the applicant to particularly specify and point out the part improvement or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.815" offset="7686666">While claims where thereafter used in patent applications, they tended it first to be far mass definitive than the claims in modern patent practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.750" offset="7730343">Often what was claimed was the concept or idea or principle in body in the invention even though that of course is not what is patentable and the claims tended to be drafted with references back to the specifications at critical points where specific definitive statements of what is claimed would be required today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.312" offset="7824593">Example can be found in the claims in this court decision in 3213 cited in our brief, volume 1 of Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.126" offset="7859911">And other examples are sided Mr. Lutz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.934" offset="7875062">As the patent office and the Court's gradually began to apply more exacting requirements of claiming, the trend was reflected in the greater emphasis on distinctness and particularity in claiming included in the 1870 revision of the patent law and carried for with ever since that the important thing as we see it is that during this early period when patent application seldom included definitive claims to the extent that the Courts enforce the statutory requirement of the applicant distinguish the new from the old or the claiming requirement of the 1836 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.045" offset="8047574">That enforcement was confined to rulings on patent validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.720" offset="8070248">The question of infringement was almost universally regarded as a question of fact to be decided by comparing the machines of the plaintiff and the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.405" offset="8125001">The equivalence doctrine then was merely an elaboration of this general approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.339" offset="8148720">The claiming requirement during this period was in effect treated as a technicality going only to the question of patent validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.622" offset="8193860">The claims really couldn't serve to notify would be competitors of the scope of the monopoly that merely indicated to them whether valid patent existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.896" offset="8242970">Of course the different view was sometimes expressed as it was by the dissenting justices in 3400 but it was not until 1877.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.487" offset="8289364">Mr. Justice Bradley's opinion for the unanimous Court in Keystone Bridge 95 US that it was held that the claiming requirement is not under technicality and in deed the patentees are bound by their claims as the definition of their judicially enforceable monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.342" offset="8380792">The Court's opinion there relied under reissue provisions of the patent law as well as on the claiming requirement and pointed out that it is in the patent office that the patentees “claim is\or is suppose to be examined, scrutinized, limited and made to conform to what he is entitled to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.076" offset="8491656">They followed the many decisions discussed in our brief in which this Court has held the claim as the measure of the grant to be relied on as such by the patentee's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.456" offset="8541184">And yet the equivalence doctrine which denies this and was build on a contrary premise has also been carried forward by a kind of a nurture which can preserve inconsistencies and the law as a matter of 3525.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.019" offset="8611401">Cristor has been in a accommodation to the extent that the equivalence doctrine has been limited by the doctrine of file wrapper estoppel which prevents the patentee from asserting dominion over the area he renounced before the patent office by amending his claims to induce issuance of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.362" offset="8692799">Our view is that this doctrine should be regarded not merely as a narrow principle of estoppel, but as one manifestation of the basic tenant of the Keystone Bridge opinion and of the patent system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.663" offset="8758000">That the only patent monopolies that are judicially enforceable are those defined by claims that have been approved by the patent office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.530" offset="8805543">Our proposal therefore is that the equivalence doctrine with its wide range of inquiry and unpredictability of result should now be rejected in favor of a standard of infringement which focuses on the claims in the light of their statutory function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.989" offset="8899375">One possibility of course would be a standard that would limit infringement to articles that come literally within the terms of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.803" offset="8934588">The Court of Appeals from the Second Circuit once took that position by holding that under the logic of the patent system, the doctrine of equivalence can mean no more than that the language of the claim shall be generously construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.799" offset="8998536">But it abandoned the position because of this Court's decision upholding the equivalence doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.370" offset="9024867">This was explained by Judge Learned Hand in the Claude Neon Lights opinion discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.605" offset="9057782">We believe that the policies in logic of the patent system do not require a test originally verbalistic which would insolate the copying of inventions with only the most trivial or colorable deviation from the literal terms of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.195" offset="9140120">We think the Court was correct in saying in the Graver Tank opinion that section approach would unduly exult form over substance even though we regard the holding rational of that decision as an unfortunate over reaction to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.348" offset="9216815">What we urge is a test based on the substance of the claims, a test based on the substance of what the patent office passed on and approved as the definition of the legally warranted scope of the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.383" offset="9284942">This is not an entirely Novel proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.499" offset="9301347">We discovered in preparing for this argument that it basically similar approach was proposed in an article published in 1948, two years before the Graver Tank decision by one of this country's most thoughtful patent lawyers, Mr. William R. Woodward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.940" offset="9383163">The article is not cited in the briefs but its entitled the definiteness and particularity in patent claims and appears in 48 Michigan law review 755, after noting that the entire logic of the development of the patent system has been to limit the patent owner more and more to the terms that the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.044" offset="9487548">Mr. Woodward wrote the principal of 3908 can be reconciled with this development only “If one treats the so called doctrine of equivalence merely as a form of relief against the almost inevitable inadvertences involved in the formulation of patent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.870" offset="9574902">The relief must be applied only when the case is clear enough to establish strong equities in favor of the plaintiff and little or not in favor of the defendant or when the point is a mere technicality or so obvious for realistic appraisal that reissue proceedings would not be necessary for a full protection of the public and would be an unnecessary burden to impose on the patentee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.632" offset="9681899">This expresses the general trust of the test we have proposed in terms of whether a revised claim which would literally cover the allegedly infringing article would have presented essentially the same case to the patent office would have presented no difference in the issues of novelty, utility and non-obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.148" offset="9783986">So that a Court and would be competitors can conclude with assurance that the patent office did in substance approve a monopoly and the scope sought to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.861" offset="9838843">And vast the requiring reissue proceedings would be superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.642" offset="9861935">By this we mean superfluous is not merely in the sense that the Court can predict what the resulted of reissue proceedings would have been, but superfluous because the Court has satisfied that they would have been nothing more for the patent office to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.172" offset="9932048">Under this standard, it seems to us that the expansion of the patent monopoly granted by the court's below in this case is the kind of expansion that should require her reissue proceeding and not be made by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.685" offset="10002160">The claim here was expressly limited to a play patent in which the base plate has “a pair of space openings” through which the draw strings are threaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.049" offset="10047613">Petitioner threads the draw strings through a single opening in the base plate of his play patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.217" offset="10072273">The claim could have been drafted so as to cover both situations either in the form of the means claim such as “said base plate having an aperture means through which the draw strings are threaded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.989" offset="10151372">This is drafted in the consultation with the patent office I might add or by claiming that the base plate has “at least one opening” through which the draw strings are threaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.436" offset="10201109">In deed, there's a means claim at the end of this very claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.526" offset="10217514">The difference relates to a functional aspect of the invention about which it seems to us the Courts cannot confidently conclude that the more embracive claim would have presented no differences in the issues of novelty, utility and non-obviousness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.332" offset="11128665">When you take away the top, you have left simply the bare issue of one party attempting to get for nothing something they've bought and agreed to pay for and enjoyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.239" offset="11208286">This is not a simple straightforward license agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.678" offset="11222079">This is a purchase of entire business, respondent Tigrett Industries sold its playpen business, children's furniture business to Standard Industries, the entire business, inventory, parts, anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.385" offset="11280906">A lump sum was paid down but in order to facilitate the operations of the purchaser, will allow to pay us it went and the agreement was the Tigrett would give petitioner a license on the golden convertible patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.212" offset="11352168">And Standard would pay 2% to the seller, Tigrett Industries, the company for a period of five years on the toys or that this patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.854" offset="11390830">That was a means and expedient whereby they could get some of the purchase price back and make it easier on the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.277" offset="11420505">The other 3% was paid to John Burton Tigrett who was the original patent holder who had sold his patent to Tigrett Industries of 3% payment basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.873" offset="11474840">So it was 2% for five years to the seller as consideration for the business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.367" offset="13364851">Well this has been raised in this case because the Lear case was decided in June of last year, on May 21 of last year the Circuit Court of Appeals decided this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.365" offset="13412812">So therefore I have assumed after this court accepted the petition on view of the holding in Lear and it wasn't until last fall that I realized that doctrine of equivalence could have been interjected and the Government form in their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.666" offset="13465997">So the problem was that the defendant wants go back down and try validity again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.604" offset="13501837">And as using the Lear case, it's sort of a club.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.061" offset="13515630">I feel it's improper for the reason I've announced the Court as being assignment, but on the -- from arguing those standpoint only or argument sake alone, let us assume the Court does not concede distinction in that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.238" offset="13580309">I feel that the record below establishes that the defendant have the right to make many attacks upon the patent which it owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.512" offset="13633390">The record and petitioner for certiorari makes certain reference as to colloquy between counsel, defendant's counsel and the Court relating to the other patent, that so called play around patent which there is now a concession of no issue of validity or infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.085" offset="13703711">However, when that patent before the District Court as the record shows the defendants were not reluctant to attempt to attack that patent upon the ground that it's set forth structure imbibing expired patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.845" offset="13774764">The reference made to page 129 A-3 is also colloquy relating to the play around patent and not to go to convertible patent which shows that the defendant also knew that they had the right to come in and bring other patent before that Court to narrow the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.397" offset="13856998">It's a two well known experience which this Court remark upon the Lear case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.729" offset="13874239">Consequently, the defendants knew about this possibility to attacking the patent, which is before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.649" offset="13906004">Yet for some reason, the District Court, they raised non of these efforts, made no attack and that narrow the scope of the claims that happened before this Court are to bring an expired patents much says even other a squeak that there might have been some patent lurking somewhere which would invalidate this patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.570" offset="13981654">We had no knowledge and you have no knowledge as of this today of any patents which invalidate the patent suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.011" offset="14007463">You have never been informed of one yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.995" offset="14015404">The Court was never even given a suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.623" offset="14025853">There was no author of introduction of any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.415" offset="14041004">And therefore, since the defendants knew they had many experience open to them and did not avail themselves out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.430" offset="14069112">As simply raised by the brief before this Court that there's a invalid patent waiting around or somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.855" offset="14094817">They should not be allowed to drag us all the way back down again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.563" offset="14109654">Let them do what they fail to do the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.923" offset="14119058">They had their chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.170" offset="14124074">And secondly, we iterate our view down on assignment there was no barred at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.449" offset="14145181">Their own self-imposed concession was at the wrong pair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.523" offset="14177468">Going on to the other -- so therefore Your Honor we feel that the Lear versus Adkins decision is not applicable on the present instance and should not be anyways subverted or perverted to allow it to stretch in this situation or there has been an opportunity for the full day at Court and yet not availed out to raise the issue of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.155" offset="14295960">Going on to next point, which briefly relates this problem of contract cancellation we have never felt that this was earnestly urged by defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.902" offset="14342980">The sale was effective in December ‘64.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.052" offset="14355623">The assignment to which I have alluded was dated December 22, 1964 and it was not until four months later, four months after Tigrett Industries had divested itself of its title didn't decide well but as assigned to the banks here in Jackson the right to collect our 2% override which we hope we're going to get and for the benefit of our creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.252" offset="14464397">In December 1966, 20 months after the assignment for the benefit of creditors, respondents are advised in a very informal oral manner outside the courtroom that their defenses they had no title no longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.844" offset="14550706">Their title was completely expunged by virtue of this assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.732" offset="14570350">And therefore we had no right at all to collect the money because they had nothing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.573" offset="14589680">Nothing they could do about but they lost the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.550" offset="14605563">We were dumbfounded and yet you'll find nothing in the pleadings, which even suggest desperate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.844" offset="14630745">It was raised at the trial below but not brought to the attention of the party's until one year after institutional suit and consequently we think it understatement to call an after thought, to call a mere rationalization for not paying what they agreed to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.565" offset="14709635">Their argument is that as of the time of the assignment for benefit of creditors, the title to the patent ceased and they had lost the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.702" offset="14762193">Their view is if the underlying agreement were by John Burton Tigrett had assigned the patent to Tigrett Industries originally call for the fact that in the event in that agreement, the purchaser, not Tigrett Industries by name but the purchaser, if they made an assignment to the benefit of creditors, the license in one hand of that assignment and the other would be automatically cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.056" offset="14863548">His position of the defendants that sends Tigrett Industries made this assignment for the benefit of creditors four months after they got -- after petitioner got title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.071" offset="14911613">The petitioner lost its rights, lost the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.869" offset="14930840">The assignment at page 76 A of the appendix and my brother Bader add to the Court states that Jackson Furniture Company agrees to abide by all the obligations, terms and conditions of the seller as more specifically set forth in the agreement dated July 19, 1961 between John Burton Tigrett of Jackson custody of Tigrett Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.871" offset="15042853">We contend that this so called assignment for the benefit of creditors in an agreement was a condition which petitioner accepted and petitioner then stood in the shoes of its assignor and that clause then related only to petitioner and not to the assigning party who is no longer interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.818" offset="15154657">Just as in corporate and contracts, an assignment of this type extinguishes the right of the assignor against the third party and substitutes a precisely similar one in the assignee.</text>

            <text syncTime="4468.364" offset="17976822">But fourthly and most important is the fact that the equivalent structure must have been something known at the time of the patent are subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.149" offset="18219969">It cannot be an inventive act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.088" offset="18219865">The Reece case in 1871 decided by this Court brought that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.388" offset="18219760">In 1890, we have Professor Robinson and on patents brought the same point out that it must be known in the arts at the date of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.535" offset="18219656">In the Graver case, this court made the same statement that the important factor is whether persons reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the interchangeability of the ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.331" offset="18219551">It have to be something known.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.826" offset="18219447">If it became invention then it was of course beyond the doctrine of equivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.350" offset="18219342">This is also the notes since 1890 in textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.823" offset="18219238">(Inaudible) brings that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.202" offset="18232195">Now the Government in his brief at countless places states that the doctrine of equivalence prevents inventing around, prevents invention around.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.317" offset="18288619">Now the use of the word invention can't be accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.270" offset="18304502">It's used too often.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.976" offset="18311293">And what is invention?</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.934" offset="18319130">We presumed that invention is what this court held to be in the Graham case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.306" offset="18336580">It must be unobvious and therefore if it is unobvious, it cannot be in equivalent because in the equivalent has got to be obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.209" offset="18376182">Consequently this doctrine have nothing to do with defending others from being creative, from using ingenuity, and showing skills beyond the mechanical skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.790" offset="18414529">In fact, it encourages all of these to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.985" offset="18427277">The Government's position would seem to be to more or less under the guys of competition in public policy to really be encouraging the free loaders, the commercial parasites, the uncreative, the parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.622" offset="18497912">This case is an interesting case in itself because we have the purchaser depreciating the novelty of the very playpen which is selling to such an extent we're here today and yet it's saying it's not noble and appreciating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.877" offset="18558830">As simple as that might be, consequently this doctrine is not designed to forestall technological advancement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4820.785" offset="19386493">-- Of the American Patent Law Association or the opportunity, which has been given to us to brief the questions, which are raised by this assault, which the Government has made upon the equivalence of the rule, which is now at least a 120 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.527" offset="19477504">I joined Mr. Kalish in saying that much of the position in fact a break deal of the position of the Government is a scarecrow type argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.352" offset="19516792">The Government has generalized and the Government over simplifies in making these assertions as to what the equivalency rule means and what the Courts are doing as a result of a graver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.082" offset="19635702">There are three or four points which I would like to make at the outset which my way of thinking demonstrate the -- some of the basic fallacies in the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.493" offset="19693380">In the brief filed by the Government, there seems to be suggestion that the patent clause of the constitution has something to do with this matter of equivalency that the constitution requires specificity in claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.741" offset="19766314">There is nothing in the constitutional clause, which relates to specificity in claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.907" offset="19799019">Secondly, the Government has not in a very good historian as far as the genesis of the doctrine is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.775" offset="19850428">The Government asserts that the Wynon's case was decided under a different statutory scheme, which did not require specificity in claiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.533" offset="20633475">This is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.953" offset="20633370">The original Patent Act was the 1790 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.933" offset="20633266">There were no claims required in the patents granted in the two or three period that that act was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.017" offset="20633161">Then we had the Patent Act of 1793, which was -- came to an end in 1836 when the present statutory scheme came in to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.977" offset="20633057">Now, between 1793 and 1836 we did not have in the statute any requirement for claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.516" offset="20632952">In fact, we had it during that period what we call a registration system, not an examination system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.731" offset="20632848">The examination system came in to being in 1836.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.633" offset="20632743">And the Act of 1836 contain language very much like the language which we now find in Section 112 about specificity in claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.315" offset="20632639">And this is the reason that the problem or the debate came in the Wynon's case it was because of the fact that the 1836 statute required that the patentee particularly specify and point out what it was that he was claiming as his invention that you had the division in the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.738" offset="20632534">You had the minority who felt just as Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas felt in the Graver case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.243" offset="20632430">That there should be a strict construction of the words of the statute and a strict construction of the terms employed in the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.443" offset="20632325">And then you had the majority of the Court in the Wynon's case which felt that there should be some room for construction, some liberality of construction and that the claim should receive a reasonable interpretation and this was what the debate was about in the Wynon's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.649" offset="20632221">Do we have strict construction of patent claims or do we have a little broader construction, a little breadth as far as the terms of the claims are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.850" offset="20632116">The other point which I would like to mention is the assertion that the Courts at the present time do not focus on the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.453" offset="20632012">Now we that are in the patent litigation practice know that we do focus on the claims and that the Courts do focus on the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.186" offset="20631907">Another fallacy in the Government's position is the assumption, which is made here that after the Court has found that a patent is valid or a claim in the patent is valid, it does not return to the claim in connection with the determination of the infringement issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.118" offset="20639848">The Courts do not ignore the claims after they have found them invalid and instead when they do take up an equivalency determination they go back and they reconsider whether or not that claim is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.149" offset="20711946">In the light of the prior art in view of the scope and the construction which the Court is placing upon the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.068" offset="20751653">Your Honors are familiar I'm sure with the classical statement that was made in this Court many, many years ago, which is to this effect, that which infringes if later anticipates if earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="5211.407" offset="20949034">But I've decided that I would try and answer Mr. Justice White's question that he put to Mr. Kalish about the disallowance of a subsequently filed application upon the existing patent where the patent office refuses to grant the second patent on the ground that it is obvious in view of an earlier patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.969" offset="21063241">What we have to keep in mind is that sometimes an element maybe both an equivalent and obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="5252.821" offset="21114650">Sometimes it may be an equivalent but not obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.752" offset="21134399">The point Mr. Justice White is this that in the examination of an application, the patent office is looking at the disclosures of the earlier patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.609" offset="21185808">And the question of obviousness is determined on the basis of whether or not the new alleged claim subject matter is obvious or not obvious in the light of the disclosures of the prior act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.934" offset="21247143">The examiner does not get into the question of the claims of the references that he is relying upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.819" offset="21278699">And equivalency comes in to play only when we are deciding the question of infringement of the literal language of a claim.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Neuman</label>
            <text syncTime="5372.775" offset="21594467">That has something to do with the playpen and there is a claim, which relates to the structure of the playpen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.556" offset="21625605">And this is the question of infringement which was before the lower courts whether the accused playpen was an infringement of the claim of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.737" offset="21686314">The lower courts held that under the doctrine of equivalency that one of -- well first that I understand this that there was one structure which literally responded to the claim and then there was a second structure which did not literally respond but which the courts below held was an infringement under the doctrine of equivalency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.764" offset="21786415">Now on this matter of whether or not the courts presently are focusing on the claims, they are doing exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.368" offset="21820792">They start out with the claims and they finish with the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.652" offset="21833958">As I said, they first determine whether the claim is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.680" offset="21850049">And then if there is an equivalency situation after they have decided that the accused structure is an equivalent and is reached by the claim under the doctrine, then the Court goes back and takes another look at the prior art to see whether or not the claim thus construed is valid in the light of the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.580" offset="21945657">Now this is exactly what happened in the Sanitary Refrigerator Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.549" offset="21969586">There you had exactly the same patent, the same accused structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.141" offset="21991946">The records in the two cases were substantially the same, the record in the Seventh Circuit and the record in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.833" offset="22022666">The Seventh Circuit found that the accused structure was an infringement under the doctrine of equivalency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.802" offset="22050565">The Third Circuit found that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.299" offset="22060596">And one of the interesting thing about the opinion of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals is that that Court expressly pointed out that if they were to give the claim the breadth that the plaintiff was asking for that would be invalid in view of the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.736" offset="22122350">This is why in the third circuit, no equivalency was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.593" offset="22137710">Then the two cases came up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.038" offset="22147532">This Court agreed with the Seventh Circuit and found that the two structure was an equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.097" offset="22179715">Again, as showing the great concern which the courts always have for the validity of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.593" offset="22209703">I would call attention to Smith versus Snow where this Court found the patent valid, found entirely different incubator to be an infringement of the Smith patent gave it a construction which made other prior art pertinent which had not been in that case and in the subsequent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.111" offset="22299773">Smith versus Hall 301 US, this Court found the Smith patent invalid in view of this public use, which had not been in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.305" offset="22352541">The point I'm making is that once you've given a construction to a claim then other prior art, other references become material to the broader scope which is being given to a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.239" offset="22420355">Now the Government also says that the doctrine has not been properly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.420" offset="22457031">We submit that it has within the time that has been available for research since I learned that I would take part in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.610" offset="22497782">I've had two of my office associates checked the citations of the Graver case over a period of about 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.591" offset="22541772">They had examined about 200 -- and I believe this is something that the Court be interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.175" offset="22568103">They examined about 220 citations of the Graver case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.701" offset="22594226">We found this and these are very rough figured that roughly a 128 cases of infringement were found where the doctrine was invoked and 91 cases were found where the doctrine was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.894" offset="22674996">Now this is approximately 56% to 44%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.866" offset="22698820">I submit that this shows that the Court had not gone over board in applying the doctrine of equivalency and this is particularly true in view of the fact that a recent report by Senator McQuillan headed the subcommittee on patents in the senate indicates that only about 28% of the patents being litigated are being upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.285" offset="22796518">So you've got 56% of 28% and it's a very small number of patents indeed that are getting the benefit of the doctrine of equivalency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.267" offset="22848449">Three major points that we make sir are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.038" offset="22871542">There is no factual basis for the Government's extraordinary request. Second, we submit that there are no cogent reasons for rejecting as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.046" offset="22919607">This rule of patent construction which has been so long applied by the court and third, that the Governments proposed alternative test is an impractical one and is incomprehensible unless it means what we think it means and in that event the Government's proposed test is the very same rule of equivalency which is now being applied by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.124" offset="23035904">As to that first point, we submit that the assertions, which have been made about the effects of the equivalency ruler highly exaggerated a more fancy and imaginary that real, there is no evidence in this case Your Honors which submit the -- which support these assertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.209" offset="23140185">First, that create an enterprise and technological progress are being hindered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.893" offset="23162964">There is no evidence to show that in event of efforts and commercial enterprises are being discouraged, that competitors are being prevented from seeking to invent their own that the doctrine has undermined the public interest in competitive technological advancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.302" offset="23240600">There is absolutely nothing before this Court to support those factual assertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.982" offset="23279261">We submit that this matter should be taken up by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.463" offset="23297233">If anything is going to be done about the equivalency rule, the Congress is the fore important and not this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="6154.882" offset="24722892">It has been called to my attention that there apparently is a feeling or maybe a feeling that the non-applicability of the doctrine of equivalence in this case was not raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.189" offset="24780152">It was raised below and raised very vigorous strictly below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.642" offset="24797915">It was the contention of the petitioner that first, the structure involved did not fall within the terms of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6181.736" offset="24830307">Secondly, that the doctrine of equivalence had no applicability to this case because of file wrapper estoppel and number of other defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.400" offset="24868968">In the appendix page 44 A the Trial Court in deciding against the petitioner's contention had this to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.076" offset="24911705">We are satisfied from the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.657" offset="24917974">However, as plaintiffs contend that the doctrine of equivalence is applicable here because the two structures worked in substantially the same way and with the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.701" offset="24958203">And then they slide the Graver case and the Great Lakes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.053" offset="24971577">In the Court of Appeals decision where the question was raised again and where the petitioner urged that the doctrine of equivalence again had no application, the Court of Appeals said the fact that the playpen floor was adjusted up or down by strings running through the floor through one hole rather than two holes did not appear to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.650" offset="25065932">Referring to the trial judge to represent a substantial difference, neither does it to us and again citing the Graver case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6248.337" offset="25096756">So there was no question that the non-applicability of the doctrine of equivalence was raised in this case and raised vigorously throughout the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="6271.648" offset="25189961">It is the second large paragraph where the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit refers to the Graver case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="6279.273" offset="25220472">Insofar as the question of the validity of the patent is concerned, the Court in its question to me this morning pointed out that we did not feel that we could raise the validity of the patent in view of the prior law of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.575" offset="25281703">However, we denied in our answer that any royalties would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.430" offset="25305109">And I think that whenever a patent comes before the Court where the validity does become an issue because the validity of this patent is an issue if the patent here is invalid there are no royalties payable based upon Lear against Adkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.700" offset="25358190">Then I submit to the Court that the invalidity of the patent was raised even though it was not -- we did not have a full dressed trial on invalidity as we normally would do because of the prior law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.777" offset="25410435">Now, my learned brother Mr. Kalish made one rather inadvertent era in that he said that the paragraph of the agreement was paragraph 16 E -- yes, Mr. Kalish said paragraph 16 C but the paragraph actually is 16 E if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.764" offset="25490474">16 E refers to this particular patent involved at that time it is specified as an application number.</text>
