            <text syncTime="522.164" offset="2192071">I simply say to this Court that there is a remedy and to say there isn't a remedy isn't so because in Section 301 (b) expressly states that Section 301 confines for a lawsuit or damages can be given against the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.713" offset="2270229">Now, when counsel says he doesn't feel that that's an adequate remedy, we can only say that a Union -- a labor organization is no different from any other institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.556" offset="2309622">They have to have a treasury the same way any other institution has and if they run into a situation where their treasury is depleted they’re pretty much out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.957" offset="2347238">So to say that is not adequate it may not be satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.088" offset="2363747">It may not be totally satisfactory to the employers because the employers may like the idea of having this injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.947" offset="2391124">But that doesn't answer the question because if the employers felt that way and if based upon the Sinclair decision they felt that way strongly, from 1962 to the present time when this Court decided that the Sinclair case in Norris-LaGuardia was not repealed by the Section 301 was not intended by Congress to be repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.695" offset="2482134">It seems to me, it more or less was a mandate to the parties believing that the decision was wrong or that the law was wrong whatever it may be that the party should have gone to Congress and should have told Congress, we feel that Norris-LaGuardia should be repealed, It makes it very difficult for me to understand this because in the Sinclair case and in legislative history of the Sinclair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.913" offset="2578996">We have Senator Taft -- the late Senator Taft was certainly was a man skilled in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.587" offset="2605746">When he came out of the Conference Committee on the Senate Floor he pointed out that the Section 301 did not prohibit all strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.980" offset="2643257">He pointed out that Section 301 did not repeal Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.121" offset="2659871">He specifically said that the only two types of strike activities that would be illegal would be the secondary boycott strike and the jurisdictional strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.915" offset="2703026">Those two aspects and those two strike activities were put in the Section 301 of the Act giving the National Labor Relations Board making it a mandatory injunction on the Board -- on the Board to go ahead and take those actions not to private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.945" offset="2763107">If you recall in the legislative history, in the House Bill, there was a provision that make Section 301 -- Norris-LaGuardia not applicable to Section 301 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.403" offset="2808978">It was after it came out a committee that Congressman Hartley who also was the co-author of the Bill, pointed out specifically that this aspect of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was dropped in the Conference Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.056" offset="2855581">Now that appears to me and it was cited in the case and it was cited by the majority opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.751" offset="2886405">If I were in the other side, I would take that as a mandate to me to get the Congress and have Congress change the law if they didn’t feel it was equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.065" offset="2931649">Now nothing has happened from 1962 to the present time, there has been no legislation in Congress in regard to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.408" offset="2964982">There's no judicial determination which have warrant any reconsideration, the Sinclair aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.996" offset="2987342">And I think it's very, very important that we realize when counsel was asked yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.820" offset="3010644">The question is to what status in regard to the business community was since Sinclair was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.378" offset="3044916">Counsel pointed out that there's been very little activity as a matter of fact in the brief of amicus curiae AFL-CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.430" offset="3081070">They have a statistic from the U.S. Department of Labor where they show a 1961 which is prior to Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.252" offset="3112417">There 10.8% a man idle hours due to strikes during the term of a collective-bargaining agreement in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.408" offset="3148988">In 1968, according to same bureau they show at 9.1% of the man hours idle during the term of a collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.342" offset="3192769">This is not say that because of Sinclair there was reduction but I simply say that there is no real impact on the Sinclair decision on the business community which apparently from reading the briefs of amici and the petitioner makes it appear that there are some real reason for changing the posture of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.525" offset="3277511">So far as we can determine here that doesn't seem to be that reason as a matter of fact the parties in -- to collective-bargaining agreements have apparently found that this method of voluntary arbitration picking arbitrators with the expertise is a desired way along with the fact that the federal labor law has recognized the fact that arbitration is a matter for the experts in this particular feel because he run into also it’s a complexities in a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.885" offset="6862869">Maybe beyond that in Avco, in the Avco it so happened that the federal District Court set aside the order for use to be granted by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.087" offset="6903724">It wasn't clear on the record why the court had done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.974" offset="6919293">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit as I remember in the Avco case had held yes it was -- now the property didn't so but it was required to do so by the Norris-LaGuardia Act and that's the question that we left opened and decided the court left open in deciding the Avco case here, am I wrong about that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth M. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="1719.892" offset="6982928">No, you're correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.748" offset="6986376">As a matter of fact when counsel for the petitioner was arguing in this case, it sounded as if he was not concerned with Sinclair but he’s unhappy with Avco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.372" offset="7020857">And as a matter of fact, in his reply brief it seems to me that he’s unhappy with the entire arbitration proceeding because in citing this one case from we’re talking about picking arbitration counsel points out that the -- while the contract hold for 72 hours and then a 12-hour decision he said, well, my god it took four days for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.419" offset="7097031">Well, how long it would take if you went to court, and then the fact that there was a decision in December, the only way that they have a decision in December if the parties agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.571" offset="7129631">So, I simply say that by pointing to that particular case in the same quick the arbitrations are not the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.060" offset="7151574">I don't agree because in the Longshoremen when you have a dispute on the dock, they have a provision in their contract where the arbitrary comes right down to the dock right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.559" offset="7185638">It says, go back to work and that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.947" offset="7195146">So there is an answer to these things and people with the expertise in labor and management can bargain for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.282" offset="7220537">And I failed to see and where the situation has changed from 1962 to today as I mentioned previously, I can find no legislative history, no legislate act, incidentally legislative history in 1962 as the same legislative history we have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.009" offset="7295457">So, under those circumstances, absent anything else it seems to me that the Sinclair case should not be reversed and I think that’s it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.509" offset="7369435">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.911" offset="7379048">In the very brief time remaining to me, I'd like to make two or three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.357" offset="7396812">First of all, with reference to the statements and the contentions that have been made on account of the failure of Congress to act following the decision of this Court in Sinclair and also with respect to the idea that Sinclair is some kind of a stare decisis impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.232" offset="7472253">I would like to direct the Court’s attention to decision of this Court which is not cited in any of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.060" offset="7495659">We didn't cover this point Helvering versus Hallock this case is to be found in 309 U.S. 106.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.587" offset="7529723">The decision in the case was offered by Mr. Justice Frankfurter joined in by Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Stone, Mr. Justice Reed, and Mr. Justice Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.858" offset="7574758">On page 118 of the Official Report and if the Court will indulge me, I would just like to read three or four sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.831" offset="7610702">This case involved a situation where there had been three different decisions of this Court with respect to a tax matter and the Court was faced with the question as to whether it should further proliferate these decisions or whether it should just take the three decisions that come on before and in fact overturn them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.145" offset="7691995">“Our real problem, therefore, is to determine whether we are to adhere to a harmonizing principle in the construction of 302 (c), or whether we are to multiply gossamer distinctions between the present cases and the three earlier cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.083" offset="7747688">Now, skipping Your Honor, “We recognize that stare decisis embodies an important social policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.773" offset="7774438">It represents an element of continuity in and law and it’s rooted in the psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.304" offset="7804635">But stare decisis is a principle policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, where such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder and verified by experience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.957" offset="7863150">Skipping now for one more sentence to what would be page 121 of the Official Reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.923" offset="7887078">“This Court, unlike the House of Lords, has from the beginning rejected the doctrine of disability and self-correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.568" offset="7913618">Whatever else may be said about want to congressional action to modify by legislation the result from the St. Louis Trust cases, it will hardly be urged that the reason was Congressional approval of these distinctions” and then the Court goes on.</text>
