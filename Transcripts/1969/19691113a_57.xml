            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 57, Ashe against Swenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.519" offset="129442">Mr. Clifford, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="13.333" offset="156714">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.340" offset="172701">I represent the petitioner in this case, Bob Fred Ashe, who as a result of the verdict of guilty was sentenced to a 35-year term in the Missouri State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.552" offset="241560">The case involves the construction of the basic theory of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.307" offset="292551">In this action, four men were charged with holding up a poker game and as a result of that, informations were returned, charging each of the four alleged robbers with six separate offenses because there were six men in the poker game, each was robbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.343" offset="412714">So, each of the four defendants was charged with a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.162" offset="444061">In this instance Ashe, my client, was tried and acquitted at his first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.210" offset="488260">He then was tried a second time and that time he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.154" offset="520025">The facts of the case are of paramount importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.694" offset="538102">So, the court will bear with me while I trace briefly what these facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.723" offset="562239">In this town, in the Northern Western portion of Missouri called Lee's Summit, was known from time to time a group gathered to play poker at the home of a man named Gladson and on this Saturday evening, there were six men playing.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.676" offset="646040">It was a game in which bets were made as much as a hundred dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.371" offset="660877">So, from time to time there would be a good deal of money on the poker table.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.933" offset="683133">Early that morning, it would be early Sunday morning on January 10, 1960, there was a disturbance at the door which led into the basement of Mr. Gladson's house where they were having the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.099" offset="739767">One of the men got up, the door was pushed open in his face and three men entered, one of them with a shotgun and two of them with pistols.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.972" offset="779264">They said, “This is a stickup.”</text>
            <text syncTime="171.722" offset="790235">They forced the six poker players over with their backs to the wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.453" offset="809148">These men gathered up the bills and currency that were lying on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.695" offset="834121">They removed from the persons of the six pokers player their watches, any other valuables that they might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.219" offset="876231">When the case came to trial against my client Ashe, he was charged with armed robbery against one of the six poker players whose name was Knight.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="207.222" offset="932237">Mr. Clifford, I want to be sure I fully understand the facts, it is -- I think you said and did I understand it correctly that these men not only scooped up what was on the table, but also personally went into the pockets of each one of the players?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clark_m_clifford" startTime="223.262" stopTime="773.998">
            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="223.262" offset="996394">Yes, Your Honor and I was going to give you more detail on that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.742" offset="1014366">I first stated the general proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.963" offset="1035264">They forced the six men over with their back facing the wall with their backs to the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.020" offset="1063476">They took whatever cash and valuables there were on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.382" offset="1080926">Then, in each instance, they removed from the person of the six poker players, their watches, their rings, their billfolds, whatever they could find of value on the six men who were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.584" offset="1149680">The question is a curious one as to whether there were three or four of the alleged robbers who came in, but in any event, after they had performed this robbery, these men were tied up.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.438" offset="1217076">Their trousers were taken away from them in an effort perhaps to prevent pursuit and the robbers left.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.371" offset="1256887">So that just taking Ashe alone, the petitioner here, he had six informations filed against him, alleging these six offenses against the poker players.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.950" offset="1327208">So when the first trial came on, four of the poker players were called as witnesses among a number of other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.272" offset="1360436">The fact is 15 witnesses were called by the state in this first trial against Ashe.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.591" offset="1389693">Gladson at whose house the game was held identified one of the robbers, a man named Brown because as the robbers came in they had hats on, they had bandanas around their face and were difficult to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.204" offset="1468165">But in the course of the proceedings, Brown's bandanna fell down and Gladson identified him and knew him there in town.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.450" offset="1501184">So, he identified him but could not identify any of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.006" offset="1523440">Knight, the second witness at the first trial, said he'd heard that some people claim there were four men in the holdup, but he only recalled three and he couldn't identify any of the three.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.865" offset="1590836">McClendon, the third poker player said that he remembered only three men in the basement and he identified all three of them as Johnson, Larson and Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.076" offset="1659695">He was asked about Ashe at this particular case and said, no, he couldn't remember seeing Ashe in the basement where they were having the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.450" offset="1705148">Roberts, the fourth member of the game, did identify Ashe as one of the robbers, but in a curious manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.407" offset="1744959">He said, “I didn't see his face that evening in the room where the poker game was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.309" offset="1776619">I couldn't see his hands because these men all had gloves on and I really couldn't identify his voice, but Ashe was one of the robbers and he is sitting over there at the trial table when the case came to trial and that is Ashe and he was one of them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="440.707" offset="1866167">From there, the trial, the first trial went then to the question that the robbers escaped, stole one of the cars belonging to the poker players and escaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.411" offset="1917053">Early the next morning, witnesses saw this group and two or three witnesses saw the stolen car with three men in or around it, one lying on the ground next to it, two sitting on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.092" offset="1991764">And the next morning, Sunday morning, maybe 8 o'clock or so, these three men were picked up, that's Johnson, Larson and Brown, those were the three that McClendon incidentally had recognized in the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.198" offset="2052159">They were picked up by a Missouri Highway Patrolman.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.602" offset="2065742">Ashe was not with those three men.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.683" offset="2082147">Also, these three men picked up near the stolen car, all had money on them; ones, fives, tens, twenties, something that kind; the same kind of currency that had been used in the poker game.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.717" offset="2142229">When the stolen car was found near which one witness had seen these three men, a shotgun was found some few steps behind the car, two pistols were found inside of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.515" offset="2201475">Now, sometime later, at a point removed from this location where these three men were found, Ashe was walking along the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.221" offset="2252257">And a separate state patrolman who was driving along, saw this man walking along the highway, stopped him and the word had gone out be on the lookout for this particular fellow.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.672" offset="2314010">He arrested him at the time, had him come over and stand with his hands against the automobile and searched him.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.416" offset="2341073">All Ashe had on at that time was a pair of pants and a white shirt and the officer said he had nothing in his pockets, he had no money of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.200" offset="2384123">I mention it because the identification of Ashe was extraordinarily flimsy from the witnesses who were in the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.962" offset="2443264">The case against the other three who were supposedly implicated was quite strong because they were found with money on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.676" offset="2482030">They pretty well stayed together.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.921" offset="2491016">They'd been seen near the car and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.647" offset="2501987">Ashe was separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.756" offset="2510346">All at one might know, he might just have been walking down the highway and the policeman saw him.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.591" offset="2541693">After the submission of the case to the jury, the defense did not put on any witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.352" offset="2564786">The jury went out and brought in a verdict of not guilty against Ashe.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.267" offset="2588400">Incidentally and interestingly, the jury was given a verdict which said not guilty and they added to it not guilty due to insufficient evidence, they supplied that themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.414" offset="2641063">The state tried the case on the theory that the four men were acting in concert and that all four took place in a robbery that involved all six poker players.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.279" offset="2704488">No effort was made to show that any particular defendant robbed any particular poker player Fact is there is some evidence exactly to the opposite when one witness said, “I don't know which men of the four or three did what.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.711" offset="2782229">We were just all herded over there and we just saw them scooping up the money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="673.866" offset="2798843">So there is no specific act on the part of any defendant alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.869" offset="2822875">It is merely that four men acting in concert robbed each of the six men.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.041" offset="2847535">So that's why all four of the alleged robbers each had informations issued against them for all six poker players.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.813" offset="2878673">Now, in the case, the first trial of Ashe, there was only one issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.651" offset="2910020">The issue was, was Ashe one of the robbers who was in the basement that evening?</text>
            <text syncTime="709.455" offset="2941158">There is no doubt about what else took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.201" offset="2956204">There's no doubt that the poker game took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.810" offset="2966653">There's no doubt that some robbers came in with guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.669" offset="2982013">There is no doubt that a substantial amount of money, maybe as much as two thousand dollars or so was taken from the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.820" offset="3010644">There is no doubt that they lost personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.044" offset="3023600">All of that is uncontroverted, went in, very little cross-examination, no contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.425" offset="3053066">So, we have those facts established without any doubt or question.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.383" offset="3076890">The one real question, however was, was Ashe one of the men?</text>
            <text syncTime="749.991" offset="3103326">It was slightly complicated by McClendon for instance saying, “There were only three men and they were Johnson, Larson and Brown and I didn't see Ashe.”</text>
            <text syncTime="760.571" offset="3145644">Other men said, “Well, I don't know who there was.”</text>
            <text syncTime="764.038" offset="3159542">So that whereby time the jury had to consider, a reading of the record shows they really had one issue submitted to them.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="773.998" offset="3199352">Was it the state's theory at all that four men were involved, but that only three came in to the basement and that the other was the driver of the get away car, or anything along those lines?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clark_m_clifford" startTime="785.217" stopTime="806.544">
            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="785.217" offset="3244283">It was not explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.058" offset="3251597">The state alleged that there were these four men and -- but the three came in all alone and then one came in afterwards, there was a good deal of confusion, but the state's charge was in effect, there were actually four robbers at some time or another in the basement.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="806.544" offset="3329546">Is it not normal, usual, Mr. Clifford, in the situation where you have three people or four people robbing or committing some other crime against four, five or six that you have this kind of a confused picture?</text>
            <text syncTime="822.999" offset="3395375">People are -- the identifications aren't always precise so the identification or the particular movements are not always precise, so this is not uncommon, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clark_m_clifford" startTime="832.112" stopTime="998.561">
            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="832.112" offset="3431842">It is not uncommon.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.956" offset="3439156">I'm sure that with the excitement of the moment, with these men coming in, the fact that they had their faces concealed, I think all of that is likely to create difficulty in identification, I accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.072" offset="3499656">However, the fact is that when the state brought its first case against Ashe, all of the facts of the game, all of the facts of the holdup, all of the facts of the loss by each of the six was all put into the case and the one real question the jury had to determine is, was Ashe one of the four men?</text>
            <text syncTime="874.687" offset="3602160">The jury concluded from the reading of the record, -- jury concluded after the case, I concluded also from the reading of the record that it would be very difficult to associate him with the case, the jury found him not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.214" offset="3664227">Thereafter, in the case -- the state proceeded on the second information against Ashe.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.344" offset="3700799">The first charged him with robbing Knight.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.511" offset="3721383">An identical information then was used as the basis of the second trial, it charged him with robbing a man named Roberts and the case came on for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.738" offset="3774360">Now, I submit to you as I read the appendix of the second trial, I found it a shocking experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.793" offset="3822529">The case had changed very considerably.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.064" offset="3843636">Gladson, who at the first trial had said, “I could only identify Brown because his mask fell off” now says, “Yes, Ashe was one of the robbery,” just a flat categorical statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.948" offset="3895150">He was tied up with the fact that I -- “When I saw the four men at the police station the next day, I could see those were the four and Ashe was one of them” so he then changes his story.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.110" offset="3935796">He apparently knew more about what happened that night at the second trial than he knew after the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.295" offset="3964531">Knight, who didn't know anybody at the first trial, maintained his same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.916" offset="3986996">He didn't know anybody at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.904" offset="3999013">McClendon, the man who'd at the first trial had said there were only three men and they were Johnson, Larson and Brown was not called by the state the second time because he had been so positive about the identity of the three robbers which did not -- his identification did not include Ashe so he was not called by the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.680" offset="4126072">Six and a half weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.862" offset="4142791">Roberts, the fourth man, called again although still, having difficulty with the fact that the mask were on, he also flatly said that he identified Ashe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.053" offset="4191587">And he now, between the first and second trials, had concluded that he had identified him as a result of a -- of his voice which he had not done at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.145" offset="4239966">Now, in that case after this finding, the case went on and obviously, as you look through the record, you would see a process going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.953" offset="4327215">Witness' stories are strengthened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.712" offset="4338186">They pick up little details here that they testified to it the second trial which they didn't at the first trial, weak places are bolstered up, here is a perfect illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.647" offset="4373922">Obviously, the prosecution was very concerned that when Ashe was picked up, he just had pair of trousers and a shirt on and had no money of any kind on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.094" offset="4423764">So, at the second trial, an effort was made to show that he did have some money on him, but they couldn't get around the first statement of the highway patrolman that he had searched Ashe and found nothing on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.914" offset="4491055">So, they put on a deputy sheriff who was at the jail in Jackson County and this it seems to me is really quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.119" offset="4535881">I want to read just two or three questions and answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.607" offset="4553749">He said he had found some money on Ashe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.473" offset="4573288">Where was the money?</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.674" offset="4578095">Answer, “In his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.531" offset="4585514">He had some in his coat pocket, I think.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.759" offset="4598366">Question; “Did he have some in his shoe or sock?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.956" offset="4611218">“That is a mistake I made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.483" offset="4617279">I got it all out of the pocket of his coat.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.710" offset="4630235">Well, that's a little troublesome to the state because he never had a coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.777" offset="4646431">They found him at the very beginning with just pants and shirt and he'd never had a coat on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.950" offset="4667120">Then this, “Didn't you tell me prior to this, you took it out of his shoe?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.214" offset="4684257">Answer, “No, I said I made him take his shoes and socks off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.939" offset="4703169">That was a misunderstanding because I have heard it four or five times.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.970" offset="4727202">Sometime between the first trial and the second trial, this particular witness had had suggested to him four or five times that he had found some money in Ashe's shoe between his sock and his shoe because there was no evidence of any kind about any money in his shoe in the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.717" offset="4814242">And to compound what I believe is the gross injustice here, although, this witness's name is Autoray, the deputy sheriff who took his shoes and socks off, had testified at the first trial and said nothing about finding any money in his shoe and sock at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.154" offset="4903999">The prosecutor at the second trial was very anxious to get this deputy sheriff to say that and when he wouldn't say it, then the deputy sheriff claimed surprise and asked leave to cross-examine him as a hostile witness although he had testified six weeks before at another first trial and never mentioned about the money in the shoe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.459" offset="5085184">What I'm -- they did Your Honor and the second time, they said, they brought in the verdict of guilty and it was under that guilty finding that he was sentenced to serve the term in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.327" offset="5140668">Now, the point is that it is our contention in behalf of Ashe that the substance, the thrust of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is carried over into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.475" offset="5233246">And it is our contention that after he was acquitted of the first charge, when there was only one real issue and that is “Was Ashe there,” that that then became the finding of the jury and he should not have been tried again on that issue, that is the contention that we make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.021" offset="5331466">Now, in this regard, when our brief was filed, there was a federal rule regarding the application of double jeopardy and a state rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.596" offset="5385801">It was perhaps best stated by the decision in State versus Palko, Justice Cardozo, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.966" offset="5427284">No, alright, State versus Palko where it was alleged and held that there was one rule for federal cases and one rule for state cases and in the state case a very watered down requirement was leveled against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.722" offset="5526235">I think it was Judge Cardo -- Justice Cardozo in the Palko case who said, “We will not disturb a second finding of guilty in a state case unless the hardship is so shocking and acute as to be unendurable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.196" offset="5604185">That is the substantial language in -- and the Palko decision was followed for quite a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.114" offset="5631875">Now, that was changed, but I'll get to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.772" offset="5646503">We contend that in even in this instance, when there is but one issue in a case and the state has full opportunity to present its case and the one clear issue is decided in favor of the defendant in that case, that he should not be tried again for the charge for which the jury has obviously found one positive result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.721" offset="5770219">So, we say that even if Palko were the law today, with this watered down requirement, I believe that this case still would come under the rule enunciated in Palko, but, the Palko case is no longer controlling in this regard because of the case of Benton versus Maryland in which Justice Marshall wrote the opinion just June of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.211" offset="5884217">And in that opinion, this Court said that the double jeopardy concept, the double jeopardy theory, the core of the concept of double jeopardy applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.049" offset="5955584">So, one cannot read the Benton versus Maryland without coming to the conclusion that now this Court has stated there are no longer two rules, one for state cases and one for federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.617" offset="6017860">There is just one rule now and that is for the federal rule because as the opinion of Judge Marshall said that the basic protection of double jeopardy is so thoroughly ingrained in our law that it was present even at the common law before it was enshrined in the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.559" offset="6117648">And, therefore, that you cannot permit an individual when his constitutional rights are being grossly affected as I believe this defendant's were, to have a court say, “Well, we'll apply one rule to that man on the double jeopardy question and another rule if his case was in a federal court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.533" offset="6201553">I see that I have at five minutes left and I would like to use the five minutes after my colleague has argued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.832" offset="6310745">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.124" offset="6327881">While we agree with the facts as have been related by Mr. Clifford in detail, the sequence of events that transpired in the Circuit Court of Jackson County back in 1960 and the facts that were introduced adduced in evidence at the time of the two trials, we of course, disagree with the conclusion that he withdraw from those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.621" offset="6425893">We believe, of course, that the general issue involved in this case is whether or not the state may try a defendant for a charge of robbery, if the defendant has previously been acquitted on a charge of robbery involving a different victim and different property even though the two charges of robbery arose out of essentially the same transaction and the same point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.264" offset="6552430">It is our belief and our contention that the state may do so and we suggest that the state may do so, first because the second trial based upon a second separate and distinct offense did not amount to fundamental unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.173" offset="6644067">Secondly, we suggest that the constitutional prohibition against placing a person twice in jeopardy for the same offense is precisely that, that the test is the identity of the offense rather than the test being the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.831" offset="6734660">Third, we suggest that the principle of collateral estoppel is not applicable upon the facts presented in this case and finally, that even if this Court should conclude that the principle of collateral estoppel applies to the fact of this case, that it is not required by the constitution either under the double jeopardy provision or as a part of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.248" offset="6852315">We believe that these issues based upon the questions presented in this case must be resolved in favor of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.697" offset="8522167">I think it was equally suggested by the Missouri Supreme Court and by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit that even though there had been other evidence that was un-contradicted as to the taking of property or as to a number of other elements that they might have found on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.739" offset="8594369">And I think too, it was interesting that the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit observed that perhaps the jury finding these six gentlemen playing poker until I believe about four o'clock in the morning for -- as Mr. Clifford has indicated quite sizable stakes, the jury may have simply decided that they were not going to extend any protection of the law to the people that were engaging in this type of activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2224.944" offset="9003133">As indicated by Mr. Clifford, of course, at the time that this case originally came to this Court and at the time that the briefs were in the process of being prepared and submitted, Palko versus Connecticut was of course still essentially the law insofar as the application of the Fifth Amendment to state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.304" offset="9076590">Since that time of course we have had Benton versus Marilyn and Justice Marshall speaking for the Court of observed there that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritages and that it should apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.844" offset="9154748">And its -- while that case did not deal specifically with the question as to whether this applicable to the same offense or what type of test you would apply in determining whether a person has been placed twice in jeopardy, I think its significant that there was quotation in that opinion from Blackstone and significant that the quotation was at the plea of former acquittal as grounded on the universal maxim of law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life more than once for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.904" offset="9291003">And I submit that it is interesting that the constitutional language, the language that is used by Blackstone is the same offense and it is interesting to note that in the common law cases of England that the emphasis was placed upon the identity of the offense from the standpoint of the same evidence test perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.166" offset="9372087">And I submit that when you apply that same evidence test and that is namely whether or not in the second trial, the identical evidence which was produced at the first trial was necessary to support the indictment that we must conclude that there is not that identity of offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.418" offset="10537044">Once again, Your Honor, I've suggested that I do not feel that I can indicate a mathematical number to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.220" offset="10564211">But I think that the protection which does extend to this defendant would be a protection under a fundamental unfairness and perhaps this Court may well conclude on the facts of this case that that arose at the conclusion of the first trial or it may conclude that the -- after the second trial it arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.137" offset="10639966">But what I am suggesting is that there was not any substantial delay between the first trial and the second trial as was present in the case of Hoag, there was almost two years elapsed between the first trial and the second trial in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.662" offset="10702033">I am further suggesting that there was no showing or indication in the record that by virtue of the delay or the second trial that the defendant lost any witnesses or had any difficulty procuring any evidence which might have been available to him otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.363" offset="10768802">And these are some of the factors which I submit, Mr. Justice, would we considered in that total question of determining whether or not there was a fundamental unfairness and we submit under that facts here involved that there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.738" offset="10822301">The record indicates clearly that defense counsel had the benefit of the transcript, of the testimony of witnesses at the preliminary hearing that he was able to use in cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.698" offset="10866186">He apparently had the benefit of their testimony at the first trial that he was able to use in cross-examination for purposes of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.050" offset="10899623">And so, under those circumstances, where you do have two separate and distinct crimes, I submit that the second trial presented on the facts of this case did not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.190" offset="10960123">We further submit that it does not constitute double jeopardy under the test that had traditionally been used to determine whether or not there is that identity of offense that results in a person being placed twice in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.123" offset="11027832">Finally, I suppose we come to the issue then as to whether or not there is a collateral estoppel that is applicable as applied to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.478" offset="11065240">And we suggest very simply first of all that there has not a collateral estoppel because the ultimate fact that was determined at the first trial was whether or not Ashe robbed Knight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.953" offset="11119156">We submit that there was not any determination of merely evidentiary facts or merely evidentiary matters and that since that ultimate fact is not therefore conclusive on the issue as to whether or not he robbed Roberts on the separate, second separate and distinct offense that collateral estoppel is not applicable upon the facts of the case, but perhaps more importantly, we suggest that collateral estoppel need not be applied by this Court simply because as indicated in this Court's decision in Hoag versus New Jersey there was a reluctance to declare the principle of collateral estoppel as a constitutional principle that was applicable to the state action and we submit that the same reasoning which was applied by the Court at that time should once again be applied by the court to the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.889" offset="12190908">The question asked by Mr. Justice White; the federal court for a long time has distinguished between a strict double jeopardy case and what we will call a double jeopardy situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.838" offset="12262693">The Benton case was one where a defendant had been found guilty of both burglary and larceny and when he was or had been charged with burglary and larceny and on trial had been acquitted of larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.579" offset="12321729">The court held he could not be charged or tried again on larceny because it was now the federal rule was applying and it was double jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.447" offset="12381184">Now, this Court, the Supreme Court, and many of the Court of Appeals, Federal Courts of Appeals have met the question of what do you do in a double jeopardy situation when it is not the exact charge that is being directed against the defendant for the second time?</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.820" offset="12462686">They have in that instance resorted to the accepted rule of collateral estoppel and they have said many times that when the facts of a case show clearly that there is one major thrust to the state's evidence and the defendant has met that and has been acquitted on that one major point, then we are not going to make him run the gauntlet again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.407" offset="12589014">It compares collateral estoppel with the theory of res judicata.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.081" offset="12691728">It was not, it was not, but it was -- on those particular facts he said that this should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.152" offset="12719940">Justice Holmes did it in Oppenheimer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.930" offset="12735091">There is an excellent review of the whole question of collateral estoppel in the Kramer case where Judge Friendly of the Second Circuit analyzes the whole matter and says that it should be used in federal cases when it's appliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.585" offset="12793710">And under the Benton decision, this case now must be looked at in the light of the federal rule and not the old state rule which has now become archaic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.737" offset="12838327">Second quick point, the State of Missouri, in the Supreme Court of Missouri, in the Federal District Court, in the Federal Court of Appeals and here has cited the Hoag case as its authority for forcing this man to serve this sentence when he was tried on exactly the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.514" offset="12929442">A quick comment on the Hoag case; that was a case tried in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.330" offset="12952743">It so happens that Justice Brennan sat in that case, it was a four to three decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.331" offset="12976671">Justice Brennan dissented in that case, it was a holdup case like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.862" offset="12998823">That case came on to the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.834" offset="13014706">Justice Brennan abstained and it was a five to three decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.804" offset="13034559">If he had voted I assume it would be five to four.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.978" offset="13047306">So, we have a case that's four to three in New Jersey and would have been five to four in this case, I believe had he voted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.212" offset="13076250">Now, they can no longer use the Hoag case I submit to Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.984" offset="13095267">One; the Hoag case has been repudiated by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in the Kermeyer (ph) case and they specifically referred to the Hoag case in the Kermeyer case and suggest they're not going to follow that rule any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.406" offset="13160991">And the language of the Kermeyer decision now in the New Jersey Supreme Court is that collateral estoppel should be ungrudgingly applied in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.198" offset="13208116">Also, I submit to you, Hoag is no longer an authority in this case because Benton has changed Hoag also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.878" offset="13242911">Because Hoag comments on the fact that there are two rules, one rule that is quite beneficial to defendants in federal cases and one that really hardly at all as to state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.928" offset="13291081">Also, in the Hoag case, this Court said we're not going to go behind the finding of the New Jersey Supreme Court and look into that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.816" offset="13326608">We don't want to do that to state courts, that was under the old rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.371" offset="13340818">You can do it now because it is under the federal rule and you have the right to look.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.348" offset="13356805">So, I say Hoag is no longer an authority for the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.780" offset="13374464">Last comment; sometimes when you go through a record of this kind and look at it, it's murky, it's difficult to find out really what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.618" offset="13421798">Occasionally, you come to a door and you open the door and let light right on in, that happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.688" offset="13446144">And, I refer Your Honors to what happened just before this second case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.953" offset="13471222">After he was acquitted the first time, there was a colloquy between the trial judge and the counsel for the defendant and the prosecuting attorney and that that --</text>
