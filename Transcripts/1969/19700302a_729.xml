            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 729, Bachellar against Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.063" offset="211675">Mr. Amsterdam, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="30.051" offset="223587">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.655" offset="245948">This state disorderly conduct prosecution brings to the Court three issues of greatly varying breadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.781" offset="298506">The narrowest relates simply to the jury instructions in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.070" offset="327659">And it is whether on this record and in light of the trial court's charge defining the offensive disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.403" offset="364962">The Court's failure to give certain instruction requested by the petitioner caused the case to go to the jury on a constitutionally impermissible basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.842" offset="414699">The second and broader question is whether on this record, the conviction of these petitioners under the specific definition of disorderly conduct charged to the jury violates the First Amendment or in other words, whether the Maryland disorderly conduct statute has been unconstitutionally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.838" offset="506755">And the third question is whether the Maryland disorderly conduct statute is unconstitutional on its face by virtue of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.782" offset="546461">Now, all three of these questions have in common, the language of the offense of disorderly conduct in Maryland, resolution of any of them requires careful attention to that language and I would like to start with it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="130.175" stopTime="161.201">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="130.175" offset="624097">Just before you do, Mr. Amsterdam, let me be sure that I understand the distinct categories into which you put your three issues in increasing breadths.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.685" offset="674147">You said the last one was whether the statute on its face is unconstitutional as violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment and you mean -- does this have to do with vagueness or breadth, over breadth or vagueness or does it have to do with what the statute explicitly prohibits and makes an offense?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="161.201" stopTime="196.493">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="161.201" offset="748126">It has to do with the particularized standards of vagueness and over breadth applicable in the First Amendment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.473" offset="777279">So, when I say unconstitutional on its face, I mean unconstitutional on its face in the same sense in which this Court has looked to the facial validity of statutes when applied in areas involving speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.793" offset="830568">I am talking about a First Amendment contention, but it's not unrelated to the general doctrines of vagueness and over breadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.156" offset="855960">There's a more particularized doctrine of vagueness and over breadth applicable in the First Amendment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.589" offset="877693">It is that which we invoke.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="196.493" stopTime="197.628">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="196.493" offset="889396">Alright.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="197.628" stopTime="281.308">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="197.628" offset="893889">Now, it is not unusual that in the disorderly conduct area, the statute itself does not contain the exhaustive definition of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.930" offset="923042">The statute is found on page 4 of our brief and it simply says, “Every person who shall be found acting in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of a public peace upon any street or highway or in other public places is guilty of the offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="226.776" offset="1010500">However, the statute has been authoritatively construed by the Maryland Court of Appeals and at pages 30 and 31 of our brief, we both state those constructions and set forth the portions of the specific jury charge in this case which embody the Maryland doctrines of disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.049" offset="1095555">And there are two distinct theories of disorderly conduct in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.307" offset="1112586">The first as charged to petitioner's jury is, disorderly conduct is the doing or saying, or both, of that which offends, disturbs, incites, or tends to incite a number of people gathered in the same area.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.877" offset="1182908">It is conduct of such nature as to affect the peace and quiet of persons who may witness it and who maybe disturbed or provoked to resentment because of that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="281.308" stopTime="294.209">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="281.308" offset="1228570">Now, the term peace and quiet, there is linked up directly with the incite, and the peace and quiet are linked, are they not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="294.209" stopTime="450.188">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="294.209" offset="1280188">Well, it is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.739" offset="1286353">Again, it's of the nature of definitions of this sort that they don't make those linkages clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.320" offset="1308609">The -- the verbal terminology is--conduct of such nature as to affect the peace and quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.285" offset="1336508">Now, I take it there's a relationship between that and inciting and disturbing, but the verbal mix is not direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.255" offset="1364407">The second -- for sure, I think it maybe helpful to call that the disturbing of public theory of disorderly conduct and I refer to it as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.121" offset="1399829">The second is that, disobeying a police order theory of disorderly conduct and that which charged the petitioner's jury as follows, “a refusal to obey a policemen's command to move on when not to do so may endanger the public peace.”</text>
            <text syncTime="342.148" offset="1471927">It may amount to disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.021" offset="1483421">Now, having focused in on the language, I would propose very, very briefly to describe the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.823" offset="1514663">I know the Court is familiar with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.098" offset="1519783">I only want to touch the highlights in that brief briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.649" offset="1533994">The case arises of course out of an antiwar demonstration in front of a recruiting center.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.275" offset="1564505">There were pickets in front of the recruiting center, marching in a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.130" offset="1579865">They had signs and placards.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.270" offset="1588433">The petitioners here were part of the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.280" offset="1600449">They joined that picket line and they marched with the placards in the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.435" offset="1617063">They then went into -- actually three of them, I don't regard this as material, three of the six went in to the recruiting office and asked the sergeant in charge to display their antiwar literature which he said, he had no authority to do and declined to do and explaining that to the mass on the lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.099" offset="1691773">They did not -- they remained and argued with him for a while but no attempt was made to remove them for the office until closing time, something more than an hour later.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.551" offset="1725628">At that time, the lines were drawn down, and after they were asked again to leave both by the recruiting sergeant and the United States Marshall and they declined to do so, they were removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.583" offset="1769723">Now at this point, the testimony begins to diverge in as many directions as there are witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.913" offset="1795009">They say they were taken out thrown bodily on the ground in a violent way.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.285" offset="1820505">The officer has testified that they were put outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.304" offset="1832626">Some of the officers admit putting them down of their backs.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.100" offset="1843806">Others say at least one landed on his feet, some say they were escorted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.785" offset="1862510">A photographer present says they were all carried out very close to the ground and dropped on their rears, but in any event, they ended up on the ground outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.940" offset="1895111">They may have sat down and they may have been dropped.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="450.188" stopTime="454.735">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="450.188" offset="1904097">Is that dispute?</text>
            <text syncTime="451.193" offset="1908172">Does that dispute in evidence have any relevance to your point?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="454.735" stopTime="499.609">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="454.735" offset="1922278">Oh, it absolutely -- it does indeed Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.934" offset="1935130">If this were a case in which we were just claiming that the petitioner's conduct was not constitutionally punishable, we would accept the findings of fact most favorable to the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.891" offset="1990928">I would have stated this case entirely in terms of the prosecution's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.545" offset="2009527">But one of the major issues is, what instructions should have been given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.361" offset="2028857">Now, of course it is the function of instructions to the jury to have them decide on the facts of the whole record which category, a prosecution verdict or a defense verdict the case falls in.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.436" offset="2077132">So of course, defense evidence is relevant and conflicts of the evidence are irrelevant on the question what instruction should have been given to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.175" offset="2260093">The statute does not apply to disorderly conduct except on a public street and in certain places which does not include a recruiting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.932" offset="2299068">At the close of the case, the trial judge formally announced that nothing that they had done in the recruiting office was the basis of this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.943" offset="2335117">Whatever they may have done in there, the scene and if that's what it was has nothing to do with their conviction of disorderly conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.235" offset="2852342">The project said he would charge to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.231" offset="2864253">He did in fact neglect the charge to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.528" offset="2877524">But that's not the claim we bear at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.406" offset="2885047">We raised that claim below that he should've as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.280" offset="2900511">But his ruling is quite plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.727" offset="2906258">He didn't think that anything that went on inside the office was part of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.082" offset="2923708">Indeed, the Chief Justice's point came up at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.760" offset="2946382">It is whether we took the position that what went on inside the office was totally immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.189" offset="2968116">Defendant's trial counsel did take that position and answer the testimony be strict and I do not, at this point take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.298" offset="2992567">I think that the testimony was relevant background.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.717" offset="3002284">The Court rejected that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.734" offset="3010330">But the Court rejected it specifically on the ground that this was relevant background and not that the conduct inside the office was disorderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.935" offset="3043140">And in fact, if you take a look at the trial record, you will see that the prosecution hurried through the testimony as to what went on in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.370" offset="3072815">That testimony is quite unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.414" offset="3081070">There was no cross examination on it by defense counsel precisely because these events separately were not and everybody realized they were not.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.138" offset="4083963">Your Honor, I want to make it very clear our position here which both the court below misunderstood and respondent appears to misunderstand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.129" offset="4119907">We are not contending that these petitioners were arrested because the police disagreed with their views, they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.512" offset="4149373">We don't suggest that for one moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.703" offset="4158151">What we suggest is two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.294" offset="4164524">First of all, what is an issue before this Court is not the reason for their arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.291" offset="4184586">What's involved before this Court is a basis for their conviction and they were convicted on the theory that they did something which offended, disturbed or incited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.739" offset="4218337">It had nothing to do with obstructing the sidewalk or any basis for the police arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.071" offset="4235682">Secondly, the offense disturbing and inciting has to do with the crowd's response to their ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.444" offset="4269119">We're not saying the police disagreed with their ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.921" offset="4279045">What we're saying is that police arrested them because they disturbed the crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.390" offset="4292942">What Your Honor is saying, Mr. Chief Justice, is exactly is right, that this offense turns in large part, if not exclusively on a crowd's reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.271" offset="4328469">And what has happened in this case is, that the crowd reacted with hostility to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.767" offset="4354487">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.604" offset="4357831">Not because of their position on the street, because of their position in Vietnam, that's plain and that's plain on the state's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.887" offset="4382908">And as a result of that hostility, the police then proceeded to arrest them for creating a disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.998" offset="4407359">Now, it is the purpose of disorderly conduct was, to prevent the public from being upset, and it is the purpose of the First Amendment to prevent disorderly conduct laws from allowing convictions where the offset is ideological.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.837" offset="4458768">That is the essence of our submission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.306" offset="4472560">Now, I want to be very clear about the issues presented because in my view, the respondent takes a very different issue -- very different view of the issues than petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.669" offset="4530030">And I think who is ultimately right on the merits of this case depends on large part if not exclusively and whose formulation of the issues is the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.139" offset="4559914">For that reason, I wanted to tell the Court exactly what I think the issues are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.608" offset="4581752">The question here is not whether these petitioners had done something for which Maryland can constitutionally punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.907" offset="4611009">More specifically, it is not whether they have a right to sit in on a recruiting office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.941" offset="4631176">It is not whether they have a right to sit down on the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.210" offset="4644237">It is not whether they have a right to obstruct the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.896" offset="4655000">I am not asserting that they have any of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.311" offset="4668583">What they have a right to is a fair trial on the issue whether they did any of those things under a statute which in terms punishes doing those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.596" offset="4717798">So that the issues submitted to the jury and fairly decided by the jury would be whether the petitioners did anything that Maryland had a constitutional right to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.911" offset="4754996">Now, that is not this trial and that is not this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.205" offset="4772237">And it is for this reason that we profoundly disagree with the respondent's statement of the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.655" offset="4802017">The respondents make it a simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.928" offset="4811107">Petitioners obstructed the sidewalk, they were told to move on, therefore they were charged with refusing to move on after being told that this is so because they were obstructing the sidewalk and that's a perfectly constitutional charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.019" offset="4855411">The trouble with that is that the first time petitioners have been charged with that is in this Court, and if I may refer to the record, I think I can satisfy the Court pretty squarely on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.922" offset="4899088">What the respondents say specifically in their brief is, petitioners were arrested for blocking the sidewalk and for failure to obey a policeman's command to move on, when not to do so may endanger the public peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.530" offset="4953527">An examination of the record clearly discloses that obstruction of the sidewalk was a prevailing factor because they arrested petitioners not disagreement with their ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.806" offset="4998562">I think I've already pointed out that the issue here is not what they were arrested for, it's what they've been convicted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.183" offset="5024057">And at this point, when we want to ask what they were convicted for, and I want to look at another aspect of the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.049" offset="5055613">The respondent point's out at page 42 that the prosecutor elected not to proceed under the Maryland statute governing obstruction of the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.762" offset="5094379">The respondent suggested it's immaterial that the state didn't proceed under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.888" offset="5114964">I suggest that the fact that the state didn't proceed under that statute is the essence of this case because what the charge was, it was in fact may, was the broad general disorderly charge under Section 123.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.703" offset="5170134">Now that charge as I've said has two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.370" offset="5180897">Doing or saying or both of anything that offends, disturbs or incites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.567" offset="5197615">Now, with regard to that charge, I want to point out, that there's not only nothing in it about obstructing sidewalks but there's nothing in it about disobeying a police order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.881" offset="5230947">And this was put before the jury as a separate ground of conviction, with all the facts including Chief Justice Burger, the background facts like the fact that these people were walking with signs and that they were singing “We Shall Overcome” and they were on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.355" offset="5288835">Now, the state even in this Court caused their singing on the sidewalk, misplaced, vocalizing and suggested that it was disorderly because it prevented them for hearing police orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.281" offset="5332511">And that's why I think that this Court has to focus in this case not on the question of whether they were obstructing a sidewalk or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.692" offset="5362186">Certain of their conduct was clearly protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.941" offset="5375143">The picketing was with the placards and with the signs and singing “We Shall Overcome,” not all of it, but some parts of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.514" offset="5401475">The state's charge here was a blunderbuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.523" offset="5413491">It was a charge that they did offend, disturb, and incite a crowd of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.240" offset="5432299">That's the issue which was submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.728" offset="5442330">Now, for the state then to abandon that up in this Court for the first time, to say that that head of liability which it insisted on to get these convictions and then in its brief in the Court of Appeals -- pardon me, in the Court of Special Appeals stood on to get the conviction affirmed is now to be abandoned, and this is to turn into an obstructing the sidewalk case, is to do precisely what this Court in Gregory and a number or other cases has said cannot be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.915" offset="6471032">If the trial court had said to the jury, did they or did they not willfully, indeed we submit an instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.783" offset="6498513">I think if the court will take a look at our proposed instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.541" offset="6513560">We submitted instructions at page 15, 16, 17 which would have allowed the definition of the offense in exactly those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.807" offset="6546578">An alternative instruction I-A had three heads of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.752" offset="6566431">One of which was knowingly and purposely engaging in acts which they had no lawful right to do, which obstructed or hinder pedestrians and traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.279" offset="6596524">Over on the next page 16 of the appendix, our instruction would have defined in precisely Mr. Justice White's terms obstructing traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.770" offset="6630484">If those instructions had been given and the jury had voted against these petitioners, we wouldn't be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.819" offset="6658696">But what was submitted to the jury was not the question of whether or not the petitioners sat on the sidewalk but a broader one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.735" offset="6686281">Now, there is one aspect of the Court's charge that may seem to submit that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.436" offset="6705089">It is not in the portion defining the offense, but it is on page 157 where in describing the defense case, and I want to -- taking aside one moment to point out that, the Court summarized the evidence here as well as giving instructions on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.515" offset="6769455">When it summarized the prosecution's case, where you would think at least it would mention obstruction, if obstruction was an issue even though that was an illegal element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.541" offset="6801533">The court didn't even talk about obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.642" offset="6809893">There is nothing either in the instructions to the jury on the law nor on summary even of the prosecutor's case would suggest that obstruction was an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.397" offset="6845001">And therefore, Mr. Chief Justice, the question of whether they sat there, whether they have obstructed anything was not resolved by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.632" offset="6869870">Now, the one quibble that one might have with that is this, there is instating the defense case a statement that, the position of the defense is that, they didn't here the command of the officers to get up and move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.837" offset="6926712">If that is the case, they had a right to sit on the sidewalk or in the case of one or two of them restrained there by the end of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.739" offset="6954297">But notice that the general jury charge submits two theories of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.196" offset="6980106">Offending, disturbing and inciting is one and the other is refusing to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.184" offset="7004139">This says that they had a right to sit on the sidewalk, i.e. not to move on, if they didn't hear the instruction of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.519" offset="7037471">It doesn't say anything about whether they're guilty or not guilty under the first theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.560" offset="7053563">And it is perfectly consistent that the jury in resolving this case, Mr. Chief Justice found that although they did not willfully sit down, they were thrown there by the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.383" offset="7096926">Although, they did not have a chance to get up, or although they were held down which is their testimony that nevertheless they did something which offended, disturbed and incited a crowd to with the misplaced vocalizing which the state now talks about singing “We Shall Overcome.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.705" offset="7158157">The total current text of that activity which Your Honor really are suggested, picketing outside, going into a recruiting office, presenting literature and then refusing to leave the office and then getting out on the street, I think the jury in fact didn't resolve these conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.120" offset="7219806">I think it would be impossible for this Court to say it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.390" offset="7556890">And that very deprivation would cause inevitably the kind of vagueness and over breadth which this Court has held bad when applied to First Amendment conduct if it really is true and I simply do not take it seriously, because frankly, the Maryland Court of Appeals doesn't take it seriously, that the jury is judge to the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.273" offset="8088430">The arrest and prosecution of petitioners was based on their disorderly conduct which caused a disturbance of the public peace on a street in the City of Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.462" offset="8137226">Petitioners were a portion of a group demonstrating against United States policy in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.216" offset="8164185">However, their political views and ideas did not cause their arrest and prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.113" offset="8199816">This position is established by the recognition that a minimum of 35 to 40 demonstrators whose activities were peaceful were not arrested but on the contrary, they received police protection and were granted complete freedom to picket an army recruiting office and distribute literature to unsympathetic onlookers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.998" offset="8299395">Only when the petitioners sat down on a 10 to 12-foot wide sidewalk, in a commercial section in the city, blocked it as public passageway, refused officer’s request to move, were they arrested for disorderly conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2446.555" offset="9889625">And of course the sidewalk is perfectly clear, one half of the sidewalk approximately seems to be utilized by the picketers, whereas the other half permits free passage by pedestrians.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.324" offset="10324720">No, as I say, the testimony indicates that Exhibit 9, this photograph was taken after the petitioners were ejected from the recruiting office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.052" offset="10371532">Yes, there were police officers in the middle and this crowd is combined of -- and you might also refer to state Exhibits 2, Mr. Justice, on page 173 which gives a close up view of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.582" offset="10473723">Now, after the petitioners had been removed from the building, there was testimony indicating two petitioners tried to crawl back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.746" offset="10518340">There was an ample supply of police present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.328" offset="10536730">As a matter of fact, one of the petitioners phoned the police department the day before the demonstration to advise them that such a demonstration would take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.562" offset="10573615">And I might add that this is a common occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.220" offset="10588244">There were officers from the two districts bordering on this particular locality, as well as officers from the traffic division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.509" offset="10633383">Now, the state's position is that this disturbance on the sidewalk was caused directly by the petitioner's refusal to get up, stand and move.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.236" offset="10696286">This blockage of the sidewalk occurred when the petitioners refused to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.719" offset="10722200">As many as five requests were made, three by one officer, two by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.835" offset="10746755">The petitioners took the position that they did not hear the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.378" offset="10764936">An explanation is offered that possibly the singing at that time could have been of such volume that the petitioners did not hear the officer's request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.582" offset="10805687">Nevertheless, a rebuttal witness when Fogerty, a newspaper reporter testified that he saw the officers standing at the feet of the petitioners talking to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.088" offset="10871724">Because of the noise of the crowd, he could not hear the words that were directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.984" offset="10891264">Now, we reached the level as to the particular crime with which the petitioners were charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.302" offset="10928567">Certainly, if our states attorney is to possess any degree of discretion, he is the one that makes the decision as to what particular statute he will charge the accused of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.905" offset="10983006">We have not reached the point where the accused is going to select the statute that he wishes to be prosecuted by, certainly he was in violation of 121, the blockage of the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.319" offset="11032639">But certainly, he was in violation of 123, the disorderly conduct statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.347" offset="11052805">Number one, the disorderly conduct violation occurred when he hit the sidewalk and remained in that position, he could have stood, they could have stood, they could have joined their fellow picketers but they chose to flop on the sidewalk and prevent the use of the sidewalk with the purpose for which it was intended, namely the free passage by pedestrians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.829" offset="11154683">Instead, they very selfishly chose to make use of their own purpose for utilizing the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.749" offset="11182373">Now, the Court will I'm sure consider the position that the police are placed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.307" offset="11208600">They must make a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.971" offset="11219257">May they permit the petitioners to utilize the sidewalk for a purpose for which the sidewalk was not built and deny pedestrians the right to use the sidewalk for a purpose for which it was built.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.467" offset="11293236">And if they do make that determination, then it would follow that they would have to detour the pedestrians into the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.316" offset="11328658">And the problem that presents itself then is the danger, not only to pedestrians but also to the motorist as presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.447" offset="11365125">Another possible avenue of escape for the police officers at this point is to detour the pedestrian, so that they will avoid the area that is being blocked by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.973" offset="11423222">In which case, can they properly detour pedestrian traffic one block north and one block south of the location?</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.854" offset="11458748">And if so, what position are the police in if one of the pedestrians refuses to follow the detour?</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.554" offset="11489573">May that pedestrian be arrested for disorderly conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.678" offset="11506082">And assume if you will that that procedure is followed, and again I call the Court's attentions to the exhibits and to the various shops that are on that side of the street are the rights of these shop owners denied, if the pedestrians are not permitted to use that side of the street?</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.212" offset="11596257">All of these are practical problems with which the police were presented at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.607" offset="11629798">However, returning to the question raised by petitioner at this time that the state's position is that the states attorney has a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.902" offset="11670967">He has a responsibility as to elect which particular violation that he decides to proceed under and he did so in this particular case by acting to proceed under the disorderly conduct statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.866" offset="11746826">A word on the vagueness of the Maryland statute as alleged by petitioners, assuming arguendo that the conditions as I have described and as the Maryland jury found to exist and as the Maryland Appellate Court found to exist, assuming arguendo that these conditions exist too, what tool did the Baltimore City police officer have to counteract this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.729" offset="11886320">And I submit it is Title 27 Article 23 the disorderly conduct statute and also of course, the blockage of the sidewalk, and so far as the vagueness of the statute is concerned and I am reading verbatim, “acting in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace upon any public street or highway in any city, town or county of the state, and the question is this statute as interpreted by the Maryland Court of Appeals void for vagueness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.179" offset="12048071">The problem exists admittedly in drafting any disorderly conduct statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.082" offset="12067715">It is literally impossible to articulate with the utmost specificity all of the precise activities which are prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.377" offset="12108884">Disorderly conduct activity defines precise statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.405" offset="12133021">The subject decides the greater specificity is not feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.783" offset="12150471">Now, the state would submit that the interpretation given to the statute by Maryland Court of Appeals gives fair warning to the common man as to precisely what actions are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.683" offset="12218075">And this interpretation is the gist of the crime of disorderly conduct and I am reading --</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.268" offset="12336462">-- page 29 of the respondent's brief at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.630" offset="12357883">The gist of the crime of disorderly conduct as it was in the cases of common law predecessor crimes is a doing or saying or both of that which offends, disturbs, incites or tends to incite a number of people gathered in the same area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.274" offset="12440430">Also it has been held the failure to obey a policeman's command to move on or not to do so may endanger the public peace amounts to disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.367" offset="12512841">In considering whether this statute as interpreted, is sufficiently clear to a person of common intelligence, I would first remind the Court that the petitioners in this case are all college students or college graduates and no suggestions has been made that they lack common intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.679" offset="12590059">This Court moreover has twice considered the Maryland disorderly conduct statute in the Drews cases in ‘64 and ‘65 and no quarrel was found with its constitutionality on the vagueness issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.743" offset="12646379">The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland in deciding this case made specific reference to the findings of this Court in Drews.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.854" offset="12682742">Now, let's consider the other state, the other enactments of other states in an attempt to draw a comparison with the Maryland statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.301" offset="12744600">Set out on pages 55 thru 69 of the respondent's brief, the state has attempted to offer for this Court's consideration, the disorderly conduct statutes of all the states, and also the ALI model penal code disorderly conduct statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.491" offset="12837386">They all seem to be strikingly similar in their wording and I would certainly submit that the common man would have less difficulty considerable less difficulty in understanding, comprehending and applying this disorderly conduct statute to himself than he would to many, many other statutes including -- I might also suggest our income tax, regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.027" offset="12947519">Simple generic terms had been used in the statute and this expressed to man of common intelligence what is necessary or what is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.433" offset="12993076">I would suggest that the 10 Commandments are expressed in the simplest of terms, yet they're completely understandable to the sinner, although theologians might experience some difficulty in agreeing on interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.386" offset="13052949">The same might apply to the disorderly conduct statute, I don't think that the common man would experience difficulty in applying this statute, however, lawyers or judges might well contest its specific meaning as it had been doing for centuries over such terms as probable cause, due process, reasonable, competent, fair or proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.988" offset="13159320">I would refer this Court to words of Justice Frankfurter in Addison versus Holly Hill where he stated, “Legislation when not expressed in technical terms as addressed to the common realm of man as therefore to be understood according to the sense of the thing, as the ordinary man has a right to rely on ordinary words addressed to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.852" offset="13286797">This Court has in the recent past considered similar disorderly conduct statutes in Zwicker versus Boll in the Woodward case which is cited in the state's brief where the Seventh Circuit considered a similar Illinois statute and in neither instance, where these statutes held to be void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.966" offset="13375195">As recently as November 1969, in the O'Leary case where the issue was whether statutory over breadth in a Kentucky statute which prohibited “acts and words likely to produce violence and others” this language was upheld, well certainly was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.201" offset="13476133">The final argument advanced by petitioners namely that the trial court erred in his charge to the jury and at that this charge was of constitutional dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.970" offset="13523257">I would point out that all instructions in criminal cases given by judges to juries in Maryland are advisory only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.033" offset="13567457">Maryland is one of two states having this provision in its Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.834" offset="13598699">This Court has taken cognizance of this procedure in Brady versus Maryland and the Maryland rules of procedures specified that the Court need not grant any requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered, and I emphasized fairly covered, by the instructions actually given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.800" offset="13702562">Decisions of the Maryland Courts permit counsel to argue to the jury the facts and the law even if it's contrary to the advisory instructions given by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.638" offset="13753971">And where the trial judge refuses to permit counsel to argue the law and the facts reversals have resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.367" offset="13792841">Now, the requested instructions that the petitioners offered in number 1 thru 4 (a) and also 8, were properly covered by the instructions of the nisi prius jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.910" offset="13858983">Instructions 5, 6 and 7, are all based on the expression of views or ideas theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.781" offset="13894510">These instructions were, it is true, refused by the Maryland trial judge and we feel properly refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.024" offset="13931499">And the reason for the refusal is found in the opinion of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, I'm reading from page 180 of the transcript, the evidence before the trial court clearly established that the arrest and charges resulted from appellant's refusal to cease their obstruction of the sidewalk and result in public disturbance, and because they had refused to comply with the three lawful commands of the police officer --</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.462" offset="14109236">That's correct, Your Honor, and the instructions as given by the nisi prius jurors were to the effect that these are both questions that are open for resolution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.204" offset="14212159">We further note that the standing demonstration -- demonstrators were not arrested since the evidence adduced below rejected any substance to the allegations that the arrest were predicated upon suppression of political views, the instructions were properly rejected.</text>
