            <label>Mr. Alfred L. Evans, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="13.544" offset="157550">Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.224" offset="172283">This case presents the question of whether the hearsay rule is to be read into and equated with this Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.115" offset="211884">The factual setting in which the setting arose was petitioner Evans’ trial for murder in connection with the slaying of three police officers in Gwinnett County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.747" offset="258382">The principal witness for the state was Wade Truett, an accomplice who turns state evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.013" offset="287431">Truett has testified as an eyewitness to all material details of the triple slaying.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.035" offset="311463">Truett’s testimony is not here in question and I will not go into it in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.135" offset="331943">However, I do think it may be appropriate to touch upon the highlights of his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.334" offset="352737">After relating the essential elements of a car theft conspiracy, Truett testified how long with the petitioner Evans and one Venson Eugene Williams, they stole a car in Atlanta, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.469" offset="425253">The stolen car was driven to a rural location in nearby Gwinnett County where they decided they would change the license place-- plates and the ignition switch.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.799" offset="478542">While in the process of changing the plates and the switch, they were apprehended by the three soon-to-die police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.418" offset="516995">Unfortunately, the youngest officer, while bending over the front seat of the car to examine the ignition switch, put himself in such a position as to enable Evans to remove his revolver.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.739" offset="570284">Evans ordered all three officers to raise their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.264" offset="584391">They were then disarmed and manacled with their own handcuffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.322" offset="600691">At this point, Truett took the police car and drove it off into the woods for concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.449" offset="625142">As he was returning to the spot where Evans and Williams were with the three police officers, he heard what sounded to him to be-- he described it as a nickel pack of firecrackers going off.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.101" offset="671744">Upon his arrival, he saw the police officers on the ground still handcuffed together.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.241" offset="692328">One police officer was making a peculiar sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.373" offset="708838">He then saw Williams bend over and fire two or three more times into the police officer while Evans held the flashlight.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.196" offset="744155">Truett’s testimony was corroborated by physical evidence as well as the evidence of other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.855" offset="774771">It is a testimony of one of the corroborating witnesses which gives rise to the questions which are presented to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.970" offset="807267">The witness in question is Linwood Shaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.240" offset="820328">Shaw was a fellow inmate of Venson Eugene Williams in the Federal Penitentiary at the time Williams was arraigned for the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.384" offset="860871">On the day following his arraignment, Shaw asked Williams how he made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.007" offset="883440">The rather spontaneous exclamation reply was “if it hadn’t been for that dirty SOB Alex Evans, we wouldn’t be in this now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="206.887" offset="930879">The testimony was admitted over objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.115" offset="943835">The Trial Court based its ruling upon the fact that the state, in the opinion of the Trial Court, had made out a prima facie case of an auto theft conspiracy and the statement was therefore admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule for co-conspirators, an exception which is provided by statute in Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.827" offset="1798666">The District Court denied the writ, citing Wigmore to the effect that the evidentiary rule and the constitutional standard are not the same, and that the Confrontation Clause does not describe what kinds of testimonial statements may be given by a witness who is on the stand and is available for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.597" offset="1881736">Upon appeal, however, the Court of Appeals took an entirely different view of the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.243" offset="2064384">It was a statement of a co-defendant and it was a confession, if you will, of a co-defendant in a trial which we think is a situation quite different from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.244" offset="2100328">And, Bruton expressly pointed out in a footnote to the decision, I think a very important footnote, it stated that the evidence there in question was not admissible under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule and, in Bruton, the Court went on to say that it did not mean to imply in any manner whatsoever that exceptions to the hearsay rule necessarily raise problems under the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.840" offset="2218715">In so doing, it cited Wigmore, the particular section on which we rely in Wigmore, and it also cited the prior decision of this Court in Mattox in which we also rely.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.678" offset="2314115">I think there is probably some overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.432" offset="2325086">In this Court, it is a difficult task, but I think the task for this Court is to delineate the scope of the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.366" offset="2356851">Of course, this was somewhat an academic matter prior to Pointer when the Sixth Amendment was first applied to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.322" offset="2384645">Until that time, it really didn’t matter too much to the federal criminal defendant whether his reversal was based upon a procedural rule of hearsay or the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.298" offset="2436577">In any event, the Court of Appeals stated that, hence, for all state exceptions would have to continually scrutinized and re-evaluated and that the state exceptions would be permitted only where supported by salient and cogent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.643" offset="2497912">Being of the opinion that the reasons in the case at bar were not sufficiently salient or cogent, the Court of Appeals reversed saying that the Georgia statutory exception, as construed by the Supreme Court of Georgia and as applied under the facts and circumstances of the case at bar, violated Evans’ confrontation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.004" offset="2587355">Now, in our brief, we set forth four reasons why we think the Court of Appeals was wrong and ought to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.552" offset="2617553">First and foremost, we think the Court of Appeals erred when it elevated that ancient and much maligned exclusionary rule, known as the hearsay rule, to the level of a constitutional mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.049" offset="2675545">The view stated by Wigmore, which we think to be the correct view under prior decisions of this Court is that the constitution, does not deal with the questions of what kinds of testimonial statements must be given infra-judicially, this being dependent upon the law of evidence for the time being, but only upon what procedure shall be followed, which is of course a cross-examining procedure by the old-- which, as to that testimony which is required by the ordinary rules of evidence to be given infra-judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.400" offset="2808978">This appears to be the view which this Court followed in Mattox versus United States where it pointed out that the Confrontation Clause was designed primarily to exclude ex parte affidavits and depositions, but not to go to the competency of testimony of a witness who does appear in Court and is available for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.388" offset="2896959">I’ve already pointed out that, in Bruton, the Court pointed out that the evidence there in question was not recognized by any exception to the rule and that it-- the Court intimated no view whatever that hearsay exceptions necessarily raise questions under the Confrontation Clause, and it cited a particular provision of Wigmore to which I refer and also to the Mattox decision which we cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.060" offset="3007613">We urge the Court not to read the hearsay rule with or without exceptions into the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.965" offset="3035199">We think it is a rule singularly undeserving of the honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.853" offset="3050768">It is unknown-- as far as I am aware, in any system of jurisprudence other than the annual Jackson system, to the best of my knowledge it has been roundly criticized by every scholar of our system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.457" offset="5145161">In any event, the test has been roundly criticized by all legal scholars and we feel that it would be a pity if the reformers have to fight the constitutional standard as well as what we think is far too many hearings of inertia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.734" offset="5202317">Now, while we think the primary legal error of the Court of Appeals was its equating of the evidentiary rule and constitutional standard, we feel that the far greater mischief potential in its decision was the test it set forth for review by federal judges of the application state exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.684" offset="5294059">According to the Court of Appeals, no matter how settled a state exception might be, its application by a state judge in a state criminal proceeding is subject to reversal by a reviewing federal judge if the federal judge is of the opinion that the reasons in the particular case for the adherence to state law were not sufficiently salient or cogent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.911" offset="5387055">In reality, this is just a pure second guessing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.497" offset="5401370">The entirely subjective nature of this test, we think, contribute only further to the lamentable trend for state criminal proceedings to be conducted as ping pong matches between state and federal tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.410" offset="5461034">We hope, first and foremost, that this Court will decline to elevate the hearsay rule to a constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.786" offset="5490500">But, should the Court disagree, we hope at the very minimum that the Court will provide some intelligible object of standards so that trial judges-- state trial judges may have some idea as to how to conduct criminal trials when the question of hearsay arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.676" offset="6322030">If it please the Court, I would like to, for purposes of placing this issue and where I can say it to be the context of the matter, describe what the Georgia statute is held by the Supreme Court and by the Appellate Courts of Georgia to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.306" offset="6400606">This statute, as applied by the Supreme Court of Georgia and the Appellate Courts of Georgia, and if it’s from the federal rule substantial and if as we submit from the rules of all of the states that we plainted with, the statute provides that once the fact of conspiracy has been established, the acts and declaration of all conspirators are admissible into evidence against each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.203" offset="6516172">One of the flagrant things that’s missing from that statute, as construed by the Supreme Court of Georgia, that is present in all of the other interpretations of similar exceptions is that the statement or declaration must have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.485" offset="6593285">That is to say that where two, for instance, might conspire to burglarize a grocery store, if one of the conspirators were setting in the automobile outside the grocery store and the other one in it, I’m satisfied that evidence as to the acts of each can be admitted against the other to prove the conspiracy itself and to prove the concert of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.577" offset="6701641">Likewise, if some declaration was made in furtherance of the conspiracy once it had been established, that is, using a similar example, if one of the conspirators had been designated the function of going to purchase a gun and maybe the two of them went together to purchase it and one of them did all of the talking, the testimony with regard to what this man stated to the gun merchant would be admissible against both of them if the two were otherwise connected because these acts or these declarations would have been or could be construed to have been in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.600" offset="6873736">Now, the Supreme Court of Georgia-- I refer to the Supreme Court after I refer to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.804" offset="6898604">We have a Court of Appeals and a Supreme Court in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.077" offset="6911666">These two Appellate Courts have, in the past, recognized the rule to be, as we have stated it, similar to the founder of federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.684" offset="6946147">That is, if the act or if the declaration were in furtherance of the conspiracy which have been proved, it would be admissible against any co-conspirator who was shown to be a member of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.923" offset="7007065">In the older Georgia cases, we have cited some in our brief, have gone along with this rule but, somewhere along the line without ever overruling that rule, the Appellate Courts of Georgia have dropped the furtherance requirement and recognize only that if a statement is made during the course of a conspiracy during its pendency then it’s admissible against all of the co-conspirators whether or not it was in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.780" offset="9150464">Pointer has been mentioned and I would, just as not by way of refreshment as much as anything else, say that in Pointer, testimony of a witness given at a preliminary examination at a time when the defendant did not have an attorney present was admitted against Pointer on the trial, at the primary trial of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.047" offset="9243564">This was admitted on the theory that the witness since left the state and did not intend to return to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.361" offset="9276792">Now, the Court held that this was a denial of confrontation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.538" offset="9361533">Actually, we think it is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.198" offset="9368116">The Court did not point out in its decision in the Pointer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.928" offset="9391104">As a matter of fact, we would think that the transcript would be much more reliable than the oral testimony of one who heard the testimony of one who put the transcript in the form it was in, the Court reporter for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.906" offset="9443035">Now, in most states, I think in the federal Courts, that where a witness has since died and has previously testified and been subject to cross-examination, his testimony might be related during a subsequent trial to the jury from the memory of one who heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.715" offset="9530284">This is a further exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.982" offset="9539271">What I am pointing out here is that, in Pointer, we were talking about confrontation as we’re talking about confrontation here, and it was not significant, we submit, in Pointer that this was a transcript as oppose to oral testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.479" offset="9597262">We think the fact that something has reduced the writing, as in some distinction has been attempted by the Attorney General, has no significance whether it be oral or in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.460" offset="9641253">It is a question on confrontation nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.993" offset="9655359">In any event, that was the situation in pointer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.498" offset="9669360">In Douglas, the Court will recall as Douglas versus Alabama cited in our brief, the Court will recall that the co-defendant was placed on the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.304" offset="9712619">He was asked to-- some questions and refused to testify on the grounds that his testimony might incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.331" offset="9756714">And, significantly or interestingly, this situation was somewhat like the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.826" offset="9786702">The co-defendant had previously been tried and convicted in a separate trial from the time he was on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.950" offset="9815124">In any event, the District Attorney was permitted to read to the co-defendant a confession that the co-defendant had given which involve the defendant on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.687" offset="9858069">And, as he read it from line to line or phrase to phrase, he would ask the co-defendant who was physically on the witness stand whether or not he had made such a statement, and on each occasion the co-defendant would state “I refuse to testify on the grounds that it might incriminate me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.615" offset="9925883">After having this placed before the jury, actually not in the form of evidence, the confession of the co-defendant, the Solicitor or the District Attorney put a witness on the stand to prove that the co-defendant who had refused to testify have given a confession had it identified, but the confession was never introduced into evidence and indeed, under the law of Alabama, apparently it was not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.297" offset="10052524">So here, again, we have a situation where we have oral testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3168.474" offset="12777305">I thought from a strategy from the standpoint that it would not be well to call Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.839" offset="12798725">I might add also that Williams has a rather wrong chi, if that’s a good term to use, criminal record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.522" offset="13013452">I would point out that what actually the state is attempting to do in this case is to get the Court to reverse Pointer or overrule Pointer, Douglas, Brookhart, Bruton, and Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.168" offset="13060054">We think that in order to rule as the state would have the Court rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.111" offset="13075832">In this case, it would be necessary for the Court to overrule those decisions to certainly diminish their effects from substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.441" offset="13121181">Under the harmless error rule, as decided by this Court in Chaplin versus California, the Court would have to declare that it was a harmless error beyond reasonable doubt before that would be applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.479" offset="13181262">This Court is incidentally, as we understood Brookhart v. Janis, as we understood the code in that case, it said this error is so fundamental that it isn’t-- the denial of confrontation is isn’t so fundamental that prejudice need not be shown, that it will be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.155" offset="13248031">That since that time the Court has decided that, very recently, the case of Harrington versus California in which it held that the denial of confrontation to be harmless error, but I will hastily run over reasons why I think this is not harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.463" offset="13313233">First of all, under Georgia law, in order for a conspiracy to be proved by the testimony of a single witness, the testimony by a-- an accomplice, I should say, the testimony must be corroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.270" offset="13372479">This was a corroboration of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.117" offset="13387839">We think that this tended to corroborate the testimony of Truett and, therefore, could not have been harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.682" offset="13418141">Truett was the only real evidenced in the case, what he testified to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.062" offset="13439666">Under the evidence in the case, he had been given immunity from prosecution for triple murder also have been promised assistance in securing parole from a federal summons that he was serving and perhaps other inducements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.398" offset="13496926">We think that this was a post case from that standpoint, and that shows testimony as to a statement made by a co-defendant might well have turned the tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.602" offset="13541752">The statement, as we stated, is an accusatory statement.</text>
