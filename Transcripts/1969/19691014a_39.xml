            <text syncTime="1816.222" offset="7368286">I would like to briefly introduce my associates who have worked with me in this case, Mr. Carol Moltz, Deputy District Attorney of Alpasa County, Colorado and the District Attorney, Mr. Robert Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.132" offset="7427950">Gentlemen, Colorado is not trying to disenfranchise anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.565" offset="7465671">Colorado is merely trying to protect the electoral process for presidential elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.805" offset="7510601">Colorado, in furtherance of a constitutionally delegated responsibility under Article 2 Section, Colorado, in furtherance of that responsibility, has enacted legislation, of course, the history of the legislation going back to the time when it in fact became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.587" offset="7609762">And, this legislation's primary purpose is to protect the purity of the election process in keeping with the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.112" offset="7659813">Colorado maintains that when there is responsibility delegated under the constitution, in this case Article 2 Section 1, that there must be the corresponding authority to carry out the responsibility and do it in an equitable way, a reasonable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.146" offset="7731911">And, we maintain that this is what Colorado has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.046" offset="7755525">Your Honors, before I get into the substance of my argument, I would like to clarify the Colorado election law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.521" offset="7789484">It has been misstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.566" offset="7805680">The Colorado election law at issue, Colorado Revised Statutes 49-24-1, with reference to the three-day that Mr. -- three days that Mr. Hall makes reference to, Your Honors, these three days refers to the time when a new resident can vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.266" offset="7904423">He must vote three days precedent to the regular election under Colorado law because a special polling place has been setup for him since they are in a status by themselves, since our general requirement is one year for our local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.961" offset="7995225">We, like many states, have enacted a special legislation for presidential and vice-presidential electors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.901" offset="8023019">And, under that special provision of the election, the new resident casts his vote, applies for his ballot not later than three days before the elections for president.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.617" offset="8073801">However, as the law reads, such new resident must have been dully registered as required by the provisions of this article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.364" offset="8124792">This throws back to the general registration provision, namely 20 days, so a new resident must have registered to vote in order to pick up his ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.101" offset="8175783">The -- three-day prior to election, he must have been registered 20 days prior to the election as every other elector in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.229" offset="8212250">So, we're talking about 20 days where the registration is cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.727" offset="8234297">The new resident must comply with that also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.946" offset="8255195">So, Colorado has not cut themselves down to three days in view of their two-month residency requirement for new residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.917" offset="8310993">We also would contend that Mr. Hall does not represent even a class in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.763" offset="8334399">On October 22, 1968, after filing his original complaint on October 4, 1968, Mr. Hall filed a motion that he be considered a member of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.047" offset="8387584">This was done on October 22, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.714" offset="8402213">The District Court never ruled as to whether he was or was not representative of a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.746" offset="8434395">The motion was never ruled upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.886" offset="8446934">Therefore, we would have to say, under the law, since he wasn't affirmatively declared by the District Court representative of a class, that he is not in fact representative of a class in the State of Colorado.</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.406" offset="8952978">Now, going to this mootness question, we rely upon the authority of the landmark case of Mills v. Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.224" offset="8992266">That case holding of course that it was now impossible to grant any effectual relief and that did involve an election, the old Mills v. Green case decided in 1895 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.744" offset="9058304">And, I'm sure the Court is well aware of the law in this case that when it's impossible to give an effective remedy because of changed conditions, the Court is reluctant, well, in this case says “we'll not consider -- we'll not proceed to a formal judgment but we'll dismiss the appeal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.311" offset="9148583">Your Honors, in view of the six-month amendment down to two months, we feel this is really the telling point in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.239" offset="9188289">Colorado, by its legislative enactment on April 23 of this year, amended their statute down to two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.858" offset="9226846">Apparently, the legislature of Colorado themselves thought that action needed to be taken to lower that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.855" offset="9258820">They took such action, signed in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.094" offset="9271777">We now have a two-month requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.656" offset="9282017">And, under the precedence of this Court, namely the Carpenter v. Wabash Railway case, 309 US 23 at 1940 and the Hines v. Davidowitz outlined in our brief at 312 US 52 1941 case, this Court held that when a subsequent legislative enactment occurs which has a bearing upon a case, the case, when it goes up on appeal, must be considered in light of the subsequent legislative enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.883" offset="9406882">And, therefore, the issue before this Court now is really moving into the equal protection argument, the reasonableness of two months.</text>

            <text syncTime="3699.831" offset="14902732">I'm sorry if I misstated the Colorado law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.192" offset="14916106">I quoted what I thought was the controlling statute that's contained on page 31 of my brief, and I did understand that they could apply up to three days before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.670" offset="14962082">On the question of mootness, Mr. Baker relies on Mills versus Green which was decided in 1895.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.035" offset="14987473">I would rely on Moore versus Ogilvie which was decided six months ago, which held that a continuing problem such as this and that case involved Illinois election law, was not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.231" offset="15040345">I think the fact the District Court upheld the reasonableness of six months is not controlling because they did so under the traditional test and did apply the compelling interest test that now applies to the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.512" offset="15101471">Any reliance on the case of Pope versus Williams is misplaced because that particularly left opened the question of presidential electors.</text>
