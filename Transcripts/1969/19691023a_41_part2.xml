          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="0.000" stopTime="194.403">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.110" offset="123800">Yesterday I had said that the conveyances to these two tribes the Cherokee and the Choctaws taken together encompassed the riverbed of the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.371" offset="180851">In one instance the riverbed or the river was entirely surrounded by Cherokee land in the other portion -- or the other portion, in dispute it formed the boundary between the territory granted to those two tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.647" offset="245948">As to that latter portion, the suggestion that somehow the bed of the Arkansas River was included in neither grant is somewhat comparable to what maybe a suggestion when say the states of Louisiana or Mississippi were admitted to the union where the Mississippi River is the boundary between them and because the acts of admission in each case read to the river or up the river or down the main channel of the river as these conveyances do.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.393" offset="372903">The conclusion were reached that the Mississippi River were included neither in Mississippi nor in Louisiana, a result which we would strain to avoid because it obviously makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.503" offset="425357">That is quite comparable to the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.204" offset="440195">We're not dealing with grants -- small grants to private landowners we are dealing with what amount to large territories ceded to quasi-sovereign tribes then defined as nations, in that time considered quasi-independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.820" offset="526608">The treaties, the fact that we dealt with them by treaties of course indicates that approach of dealing with Indian tribes as independent entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.085" offset="571747">The treaties themselves are recognized, powers extensive power of self-government in these tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.000" offset="603408">It would be inconsistent with that approach to reserve, to attempt to reserve, to wish to reserve, to have any interest in reserving the beds of navigable rivers or any other territory within the area ceded except only as the United States might have some special reason for doing so such as maintaining the area around Fort Gibson in the Middle of the Cherokee grants which was expressly done.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.565" offset="741648">So here, they might have been interest in the United States in reserving a right of navigation on the Arkansas River and that can be read into this grants to the chapters in Cherokees but of course the navigational servitude which appertains to the United States in all states does not carry in it an ownership of the bed of the river and there is no reason to so read it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.217" offset="980198">All it was concerned about or it could be concerned about was to preserve its right to maintain it as an open highway of commerce and as a way of access to Fort Gibson within the Indian territory but as to the bed there was no reason for the United States to wish to retrieve ownership.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.492" offset="3329337">And at the times we're talking about, the times these treaties were made, it was very definitely navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.255" offset="3372387">The stretch of the river is a meandering stream, as you see it from that map.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.335" offset="3408750">Although it has not been pertinent in this case and no evidence has been introduced on it and our engineer estimates that there are a little over a 100 miles of riverbed in this stretch of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.126" offset="3487848">You will note that the head of the stretch, Fort Gibson established in 1824 and at the foot of it, Fort Smith on which the first military establishment appeared in 1817.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.165" offset="3592025">This area has been substantially used in commerce during this decade previous to the time of the signing of these final treaties with the Cherokees and the Choctaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.316" offset="3672586">Now, let us keep these dates in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.348" offset="3688782">The first treaty that the Eastern Cherokees signed, and they constituted I believe about four-fifths of the entire tribe, was in 1835.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.067" offset="3747610">All treaties previous to that had been negotiated with the Western Cherokees, who then I believe constituted only about one-fifth of the Cherokee members.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.324" offset="3792645">They were a group that separate from the rest and went out voluntarily and the rest didn't want to negotiate over many years and finally arrived in the agreement in 1835.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.844" offset="3846771">Now, the final Choctaw Treaty, the one on which superseded all previous treaties and the one upon which the Choctaw claims under patent is based was executed in 1830.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.436" offset="3917093">So, in this decade previous to that, this stretch of the Grand River, the Arkansas River up to the Grand was established as a useful artery of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.358" offset="3980831">The trial court examined into the available facts carefully and reached a very definite conclusion on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.379" offset="4040913">The trial court said, “It is the conclusion of the Court as to this issue that it was common knowledge in the legal sense from at least as early as 1824 until sometime after November 16, 1907, the day of Oklahoma State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.402" offset="4132968">The Arkansas River in its natural state was a navigable river to below in its confluence with the Grand River regularly used throughout the remainder of its course in what is now Oklahoma as a highway of Commerce during the major portion of each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.651" offset="4213948">Accordingly, it is the decision of this Court based upon judicial knowledge alone and without taking the evidence that this stretch of the Arkansas River was never navigable, in fact and in law at the time the western domains now a part of Oklahoma were ceded to the Choctaw nation and to the Cherokee nation and at that the time the treaties were made pursuant to which the lands were ceded, and also at the time when Oklahoma was admitted to statehood November 16, 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.386" offset="4376952">History records substantial riverbed navigation along that stretch of the Arkansas River but during this period there were regularly scheduled trips at the Ports of Fort Gibson and at the ports, free ports just above Fort Gibson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.414" offset="4500982">In 1833, 17 boats regularly docked at Fort Gibson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.761" offset="4522402">There were 22 established landings between Fort Smith and Fort Gibson and including Redland, Sallisaw, Webbers Falls and Vian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.579" offset="4565661">It actually was the only method by which substantial commerce could come into this area and as a result of this navigable water, this part of Oklahoma became to be the first port that had any substantial settlements made in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.679" offset="4638072">It was a vital link between Fort Smith and Fort Gibson and the bottleneck between Fort Gibson and the outside world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.512" offset="4685406">History is complete with the records of substantial stores for the army post, recruits being brought in a great many of the Indians who later came in under this treaties were brought up this river in boats and steam boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.588" offset="4773700">They device the shallow draft steamboat which could negotiate this river very well in the major portions of each year and so there is no question that this was an established navigable body of water before these treaties were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.480" offset="4853321">It was so found by the trial court and has not been challenged in this case that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.623" offset="4905880">The ownership of the Mississippi River and its tributaries and I should say that the Arkansas River is a second longest tributary of the Mississippi, the longest being the Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.549" offset="4977560">The negotiators that appear into the Louisiana Treaty were quite cognizant of the necessity of securing all these waters because of navigation and many other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.718" offset="5050284">In a later date of May 13, 1803 from Robert Livingston and James Monroe to James Madison, the secretary of the State, the writer set the question of a full control on use of the Mississippi River and all streams that entered into it from their sources to the ocean was one of the paramount reasons culminating in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.738" offset="5154356">President Jefferson in submitting the Louisiana Purchase Treaty to Congress to the Senate for ratification to Congress for the appropriation said, “whilst the property and sovereignty of the Mississippi and its waters secure and independent outlet for the produce of the Western States and the non-control of navigation through their whole course, free from collision with other powers and the dangers to our peace from that source, the fertility of the country its climate and extent prowess in dew season the important age to our treasury and ample provision for our posterity and the widespread for the blessings of freedom and the equal laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3788.929" offset="15259042">The statute shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.901" offset="15270954">Now, in the Red Lake or Indian reservation were then the boundaries of that reservation was a lake called Mud Lake that the, in 1889 of the treaties last treaties were 1855 prior to Minnesota statehood, State being admitted in 1858, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.245" offset="15376384">The treaty of 1855 included just Mud Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.167" offset="15432077">In 1889, the Government made a further treaty with the Indians in which the Red Lake Reservation was to be ceded by two of the government and was ceded back to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.522" offset="15489442">The Government was then going to divide the land into tracks and sell it off and deposit the money in a trust fund for the benefit of the Chippewa's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.875" offset="15546911">A number of tracks were sold to settlers by the Government and patents issued to the purchasers along the shores of Mud Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.633" offset="15589857">Later on, the Government developed a project to drain Mud Lake and that lay bearer certain valuable agricultural land between riparian lines of the settlers who have bought from the Government and the water placed to where the water had receded and they claimed as riparian proprietors under the Minnesota law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.639" offset="15713886">The Federal Government suit on behalf of the Chippewa's contending that this lake was not a navigable lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.262" offset="15752443">And not being a navigable lake that when it was drained, when the water was drained away the land lake bearer did not inure to the benefit of the riparian proprietors but they claimed that did inure to the benefit of the Chippewa's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.938" offset="15815137">It was within Red Lake reservation boundaries and there is no question to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.162" offset="15843976">The Court held in substance that in the treaties with the Chippewa's, which did express to encompass this area within the boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.485" offset="15909282">The United States did not expressly and distinctly convey the navigable water bottoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.675" offset="15946062">The Court first held by the way that the lands, the bottoms were navigable contrary to United States that Mud Lake was navigable, contrary to the contention of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.685" offset="16002069">And accordingly, the Court held since, there was no specific description of this land encompassed all around by the reservation boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.604" offset="16041775">But there could not be inferred any intention to convey the navigable water bottoms in view of the long established policy of this country to hold the beds of navigable waters in trust for future states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.196" offset="16108126">Now, that in substance is the holding in the Holt State Bank and we think it's the holding under which the part of the Arkansas River that has Cherokee land in both sides should continue to be owned and held by the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.072" offset="16191613">Now, the argument of counsel for the other side seems to be based principally on the agreement in the Cherokee Treaty that the land ceded to them should not at any future time be embraced within the boundaries of a future State without their consent, remember that, without their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.101" offset="16331734">The Choctaw Treaty says, the lands ceded to them should at no time be included within the boundaries of a future territory or State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.957" offset="16383248">Now in 1893, by Act of Congress of March 3, 1893, 27 Stat. 645, Congress created a commission for the purpose of inducing the Cherokees and Choctaws and other tribes to relinquish tribal rights and to accept allotment of their lands in severalty to tribal members where the ultimate object of including said lands in a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.371" offset="16536848">The result of this Act and ensuing Acts of Congress were agreements with the Cherokees 32 Stat. 716 and with the Choctaws 30 Stat. 495, and 42 Stat. 641 in 1902, which provided for the allotment of the lands to individual members of the respective tribes and relinquishment of the general powers of the tribal governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.060" offset="16651577">These agreements were followed by the Act of April 28, 1904, 33 Stat. 573, which supplemented the tribal laws and put the laws of Arkansas in effect in Indian territory.</text>
