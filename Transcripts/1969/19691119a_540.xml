            <label>Mr. Lee A. Albert</label>
            <text syncTime="27.424" offset="213034">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.587" offset="225677">New York has in continuous to participate in the federal aid families with dependent children program.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.395" offset="244903">Under which Congress makes available to it, approximately $400 million federal dollars a year and imposes on the receipt and use of those dollars federal terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.836" offset="282728">This case of argues are one of those recently and active of those conditions, Section 4028-23 or condition 23 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.465" offset="325256">Who is meaning in this case is critically an issue and in two other cases now on being appealed to this Court and other cases pending in the lower federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.623" offset="361827">Cases in this -- the issues in this case to be sure are numerous in complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.111" offset="379800">In light of the limited time available we should like to take them up in the following order.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.915" offset="399026">We should like to begin with the meaning of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.743" offset="414386">We believe that meaning is clear on its phase and from its legislative evolution and then discuss the arguments made against that meaning and third change whether a United District Court may so construed statute and apply it in New York and other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.735" offset="482304">We begin with the obvious but important observation that it is a statute we are construing passed in our national legislative process in which the states are not into the minorities or unheard voices.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.043" offset="527548">This statute like all other acts of Congress; seeks to obviate some evil has some name seeks to work some change in policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.477" offset="561298">It has, in other words, some intelligible meaning and some intelligible purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.253" offset="584391">We believe that the meaning urged by us in this case and adopted by the district judge below is the only meaning consistent with the language, its history and consistent with any intelligible purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.189" offset="656175">The numerous other meanings proffered to the statute by New York, by other states, by the Department Health Education and Welfare reduce Congressional will to a meaningless exercise and futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.840" offset="710719">The terms used in the statute are not unheard of or unfamiliar in public assistance administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.940" offset="735169">The amounts used to determine the needs of individuals is a comprehensive description of a states need standard, long established and public assistance to determine how much aid an individual is entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.186" offset="788146">The second phrase we force to any maximums, those are devices used by states to reduce the amount of a below that of state recognized need.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.105" offset="823777">An adjustment to the first device in any state to pays need in full that doesn't impose any maximum automatically results in a cost of living increase to recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.806" offset="878634">An adjustment to the need standard and any maximum similarly results in a cost of living increase to states with maximums.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.871" offset="914892">That the latter increase is proportionate to the extent of the state might need in a given base period.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.273" offset="940492">The statute by looking to the amounts used and the time they were last established refers through the state standard that made during some base period.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.008" offset="983437">That base period is the time of an act into the statute in January 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.827" offset="1026696">The off shot of the exercise is that states are commanded to maintain their grant levels with one adjustment to keep pace with living costs by July 1, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.937" offset="1087091">The effect in all states is equal in so far as the conditions the states need standard in each date is accepted the maximum that it was paying during a given base period is accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.659" offset="1177997">We think that the legislative background of this statute but confirms this meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.687" offset="1194088">It was treated -- it was developed in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.121" offset="1203806">It stemmed from the administration's proposal that was quite a bit more far reaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.867" offset="1222823">That proposal required not only annual updating of the state's standard of need but it also required that all states pay need in full and there were at that time 33 states that did not pay in full, many of which did not pay more than 50% of needs somewhat less.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.968" offset="1291264">Our position to that statute in the House and the Senate committee for the House and Senate committees centered primarily on the effect of the full need requirements in those states that have long not met the standard that need that affect being very large change not on modest updating but something much larger than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.028" offset="1387499">The administration's estimate for the total cost of that Bill though, it's important to realize, was $90 million for paying full need of federal sharing that is I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.978" offset="1427310">And $95 million for annual updating of standards that were being paid in full not the case after the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.139" offset="1467956">The Senate Finance Committee modified that statute dropping the full need requirement adding in its stead that any maximums be proportionately adjusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.695" offset="1522186">It was passed by the senate committee on a party line vote, it was passed by the Senate, went to the conference committee where they amended it to drop just one part of it the annual reprising requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.543" offset="1577566">The wording of the language of the provision remains the same however from the time that remerged from the Senate Finance Committee to the time it was signed by the president on January the 2nd, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.316" offset="1632632">Both committees reported the Bill out, I'm sorry, the conference committee and the Senate Finance Committee reported Bill out under a heading increasing income of recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.983" offset="1679339">The Bill was considered along side a companion proposal to require the states to increase payments in the adult programs by $7.00 and average increase of $7.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.666" offset="1722075">And the method chosen for that increase was the adjustment of need standards and maximums. It is in short we think this history make several things clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.118" offset="1763871">One, the 402 (a) (23) is a self-evident departure from tradition in so far as it requires a modest adjustment to state need standards and levels of payments in AFDC, self-evident and quite obvious to the specialist committees dealing with Social Security legislation and certainly obvious to any Congressman who took the time to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.634" offset="1849866">Two, the evolution of the Bill makes clear that it was a compromise, it was not to establish the floor of income in every state that would be approached adequacy as the administration had originally urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.891" offset="1926980">Nothing of the kind, it rather was to see that each state paid at least of what it was then paying which was renowned for all states to be inadequate and to make one adjustment to keep phase with living costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.411" offset="1993017">It should be added in the administration, reported to the committees that most states had updated in 1966 or 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.115" offset="2019871">There was no great impact expected from the required updating by July 1, 1969, particularly one state maximum were accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.201" offset="2080162">We think this legislative history also makes clear, the companion proposal makes clear that Congress appreciate the effect of adjusting this mechanisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.765" offset="2110464">The language chosen, the comprehensive term used to describe the state needs standard plus the fact that goes on to require adjustment to maximums leaves little room for nullification or evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.118" offset="2159888">And finally, we think the fact that Congress made this a planned condition for continued participation in AFDC and gave the states a one year and a half to make the required adjustments I think makes clear that Congress intended to compel the states to do what the statute says.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.565" offset="2517661">Just as the alternative ground in King against Smith was the enforcement of the another planned condition, condition number 10-A shall be furnished to all eligible individuals was enforced by the petitioners, was invoked by the petitioners in that case to support their claim that Alabama's substitute for the rule was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.509" offset="2597386">This Court said that Alabama had breached its federally imposed obligation and that any state law or regulation in conflict with the Social Security Act in a state that's participating of course, Is to that extent invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.423" offset="4437034">For one reason or another, the government did volunteer brief in this Court very recently and mentions a few hints of something right or wrong, it doesn't want to take the position on the merits for one reason or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.128" offset="4499832">HEW also was issued to state letter, by the way, which is not a regulation of October 10th which rather studiedly begs this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.838" offset="4530761">It says at a minimum you must maintain your standards and accordance with basic needs without providing us with the definition of basic needs at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.549" offset="4565556">Nor thus, I don't think fairly construed as the Government's brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.787" offset="4586559">I should like first to return to the arguments against this statute which are said to make our meaning inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.378" offset="4628877">The basic argument is that the statute is we construe it, renders it to be a measure working enormous change in the federal state relationship on president grant made programs at considerable compelled expenditures and without stormy opposition in Congress that such a measure should have resulted in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.406" offset="4704946">We think the argument falls with each of those premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.670" offset="4718007">The cost of this provision were before the Congress, it knew that the administration's original provision requiring a great deal of more change would cost overall $90 million in federal funds for full payment updated standards for updating it full and then paying those standards in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.084" offset="4787702">Once that provision was draw up to full need, the cost had to drop considerably because it was accepting maximums in 33 states; many of which states don't claim one in 50% of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.159" offset="4828035">The administration had also informed Congress that most states are updated recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.660" offset="4842036">The cost, in other words, were modest to stay the least in a program of $4 billion federal expenditures a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.851" offset="4870771">Those cost range if one takes the national average of HEW of $44 a recipient a year and a 10% cost of living factor, the total cost would be about $30 million gross state and federal expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.156" offset="4923956">This case appears to be a very big case in terms of cost and the source supports the argument not because New York has made a cost of living adjustment, it estimated the cost of living adjustment and sound budget for this year it would $5 million the state share all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.341" offset="4980694">It's because what New York has done is cut grants and cut grants very severely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.349" offset="5000756">That is not to thrust of what Congress was thinking about when it passed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.790" offset="5022490">Any given violation of a federal condition can be costly if one takes the condition in King against Smith and against a state, for example New York decides to withdraw aid to all children whose parents have abandoned them and those petitioners invoke 402 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.205" offset="5088214">The cost involve in that case will be about $200 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.702" offset="5102216">But that was not the cost that Congress estimated for 402 (a) (10) or had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.427" offset="5121128">Although, it did passed that provision to deal with physical crisis in the states nor is this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.411" offset="5149027">But my point is the cost are indeed modest, two this is not on president and federal granted programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.417" offset="5177031">Our contention it should be clear as not the 402 (a) (23) compels the state to appropriate certain amount of money of AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.847" offset="5210781">It rather, it poses a limit on one mechanism to be use to reduce expenditures that mechanism being the reduction of grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.961" offset="5247248">The medicate program passed for two years before also a federal grant made program with similar matching 50% the New York and of fair percentage for other states, imposes very similar requirements but rather more and those were passed without controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.567" offset="5305657">That Act requires not only that states may not divert funds from the public assistance titles to operate medicate, it requires that the states must at a minimum provide a to persons who would be eligible for public assistance under the most liberal money-payment standard in the states during the last three years and it also provides that the state must at a minimum that the state must provide to all eligible individuals at least five categories of services in-patient, out-patient hospital physicians and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.136" offset="5423940">The sum total of those requirements is most and it also requires the states expand demonstrate their expanding reference under medicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.914" offset="5455078">My point is the sum total of those requirements is indeed to impose a limit on the ability of the state to participate and choose to spend what it wishes, not a rigid limit but this is not a rigid limit either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.724" offset="5502307">This provision leaves safe with a great deal of flexibility not to reduce grants which should be said, but in other areas to affect their AFDC budget of public welfare expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.229" offset="5548283">States are free within very broad limits to determine eligibility, financial responsibility of relatives, implementation of the win program, the work consented program, certainly the amount of local financial participation and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.179" offset="5624038">We think that this Court did refer in King against Smith to the state power to determine its resources through setting of standards of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.166" offset="5660087">But that's an example of flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.098" offset="5667715">There were many other examples that can be adduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.145" offset="5695927">Burrow with the departure in this provision is done so by reflecting most to the very established pattern in AFDC, it accepts as it has the government has since 1935, the enormous variations among the several states in resources and the like and a lot of this states and accepts the states own standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.129" offset="5767920">It also continues greater federal responsibility for states with lesser wealth and lower grant that's a pattern or a tradition in AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.741" offset="5798327">Even assuming for a moment that the provision should have been controversial, this is really torrential out of its legislative setting in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.534" offset="5841481">After all, it was part of Omnibus Legislative Amendment, also part of a compromise between the Senate and the House which disputed over many provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.814" offset="5878680">This was one their compromises and this setting, the absence of and it was also passed in under passed on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.355" offset="5912743">Under rules are very restricted debate and no amendments in the House certainly and at the end of the Senate, no amendments also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.186" offset="5944090">In this setting silence even by those who should have opposed that assuming there should've been such persons, it would seem to me as part of the legislative art of reaching a compromise and accord on no less than 300 different provisions that were embodied in its 1967 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.278" offset="6040534">We'll refer to now to the New York Statute and whether what it does is somehow consistent with the 402 (a) (23).</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.359" offset="6076792">In our view the heart of 402 (a) (23) is to guarantee an increase in income of recipients as the committee said based on cost of living changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.163" offset="6115976">New York has done is decrease the income of recipients by approximately 8 to 12% depending on which recipient, I'll talk about the changes in a moment and its clearly done did this to reduce overall AFDC expenditures in New York by $100 million out of a total of approximately $900 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.819" offset="6202598">That's a one out of every $9.00 was taken out of the AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.313" offset="6216600">How that can be said to comply with the statute, how the adjustment of needs standards, New York does not have maximums, how the adjustment of need standards can be said which saved which reduces everybody's grant by $1.00 out of $9.00 can be said to comply with the statute that requires an adjustment for cost for a reprising for cost of living changes obviously going up is itself startling proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.319" offset="6312626">Our view on Mr. Justice Brennan, your question of streamlining is 402 (a) (23) has nothing to do with streamlining, that is not the concern of the statute, its proponents or anyone else who discussed that never talk about streamlining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.565" offset="6369677">One should have is no federal statute or federal regulation that defines what streamlining is either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.340" offset="6392769">States have like New York; they have used several methods of providing grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.643" offset="6433938">One of those methods is to provide the grant as a supplement as it does for example for rent today as it did for articles of home furnishing and clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.961" offset="6491199">We don't think that 402 (a) (23) allows the state to eliminate whatever items it now deems unnecessary and unnecessary for reasons have nothing to do with basic -- I should like to reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.250" offset="6572387">Not only is this case plainly unripe for determination by the judiciary at this stage, because we're still awaiting the views of HEW, which the agency which if it doesn't have primary jurisdiction here certainly is the one with the expertise and the experience which should passed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.766" offset="6638425">But it's an extraordinarily ironic case in any event because in a fact the petitioners are asking courts to solve the problem of the adequacy of the welfare allowances in the various states where Congress has so conspicuously fail to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.425" offset="6693073">And they rely not on the Constitution but on a very narrow subsection test by the 1967 Congress which was simply never built to support the weight of the construction that this petitioners seek to place upon it, which is in affect what the Court of Appeals held aside from ruling that there was no jurisdiction in the first place and over and above that, that the case was clearly unripe for the termination because HEW hasn't given us its views yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.123" offset="6795891">And I'd like to advert to that briefly and first if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.164" offset="6811982">This is a very different situation from the King against Smith where the Alabama substitute for the regulation was set aside and there was a long history of acquiescence by HEW in the regulations of that type which the various states had.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.683" offset="7722088">It will be a "Yes" because and they'll go into reasons because they have the expertise to do that and then that's what they've done in every aspect of the New York legislation through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.759" offset="7774438">Now, below a great deal of reliance is placed on King against Smith not only on the question of the unrightness of this case, but in general not withstanding the superficial similarity and subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.708" offset="7818219">This is a very, very different case from King against Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.653" offset="7833997">The complete absence of the justifiable constitutional claim such as existed in King against Smith not only under the cuts the Courts basis for jurisdiction here but it also demonstrates the petition -- on the merits the petitioners claim is simply untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.066" offset="7891675">Moreover, King against Smith and Thompson against Shapiro as well not only involve constitutional issues but also involve the eligibility of persons for welfare and this claim here is merely a claim regarding the amount which its old position is a very, very substantial difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.030" offset="7955519">Furthermore, in King against Smith and in the Thompson against Shapiro, the residency case, there was no requirement that if the Court were to overrule New York Statute would automatically in effect appropriate money from the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.025" offset="8015496">Those issues didn't exist in King against Smith or in Thompson against Shapiro and consequently if the Eleventh Amendment doesn't act as a bar to such a situation which we submitted thus and which the three-judge court in Williams against Dandridge, which is on appeal to this Court held that the federal court had to stop short of simply categorically ordering a state legislature to appropriate money for welfare, that's what's clearly involved in the relief that these petitioners seek, which as I've said is entirely different from the two cases they rely on the most heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.954" offset="8159169">Now, let's examine the statute on which the petitioners solely relied and what it says is that state shall adjust the amounts that are used to determine the needs of individuals or in the opulence of the welfare official standard of need and any maximum imposed on the aid of the aid paid to families which my colleague concede New York doesn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.173" offset="8248090">A maximum is at flat dollar amount such as $200.00 per family in which you just don't have anymore no matter how large the family is which the Court in Williams against Dandridge and in the main case Westbury against Fisher, the three-judge court declared to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.426" offset="8313083">That's definitely not involved in this case New York never had a maximum of that sort and doesn't now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.262" offset="8336384">In any events, 602 (a) (23) says that the standard of need and any maximums which New York doesn't have, has to be adjusted to reflect increases in the cost of living and New York as the Court of Appeals held fully complied with the mandates of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.446" offset="8405138">The level of actual allowances to welfare recipients in New York State is highest in the country as appears from the appendix to our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2157.571" offset="8733654">In Missouri, the standard of need is set to be a substantially higher figure 305 but the actual amount paid is only 124.</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.283" offset="8860505">And that's precisely what New York has always lived up to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.962" offset="8879208">That the social service is proponent, the respondents here takes its own cost of living surveys throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.702" offset="8906167">It also employs the Bureau of Labor Statistics federal figures and it reprised in May of 1968 and then adjusted the standard of need and the levels of payment because in New York their tied together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.524" offset="8957471">In August of 1968, prior to 131 (a) when the levels was said administratively and that's illustrated by the fact that for a family four exclusive of rent, because rent is paid additionally its tacked on for the monthly allowance in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.453" offset="9017135">The average went up from 173 a month to 191 a month for a family of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.979" offset="9039287">And thereafter, 131 (a) was passed which used as its matrix, the reprising which took place in 1968 and the way that it worked was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.040" offset="9095502">The legislature took an average of the age of the oldest child in order to eliminate the vast administrative paperwork in the time of Social Services officials which went to figuring out what the age of the oldest child was in any given family when you're dealing with hundreds or thousands of families.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.719" offset="9162271">The court can appreciate the time consuming nature of that job in addition to the readjustments, everytime the oldest child in the family reached another year, that placed the family in another bracket and if the family didn't get around to notifying the local official or if the officials were lax, then there was a deferment to that family, they didn't get the increase that they were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.210" offset="9240221">So what the legislature did was it averaged these disparities based on the age of the oldest child and it took a figure which was based on that average and now a family of whatever size depending only on whether it's adults or children gets a certain specific amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.386" offset="9308871">There was no cutback into characterize it as a cutback as the petitioners repeatedly do simply sheds heat and not light.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.521" offset="9405419">What special grants mean as we described them in our brief and I don't think there's any dispute about this is at the recipient of welfare has to go half in hands to the local official asking for special grant to cover a specific purpose, it's degrading, it's time consuming and again requires a great deal of administrative paperwork.</text>

            <text syncTime="2685.157" offset="10844035">Now, when we look at 602 (a) (23) as we have to in order to try to gleam what Congress meant when it passed it, we see that first of all it's a very minor thought of Section 602 of the Social Security Act and the supremacy clause although my colleague here adverts to it clearly isn't relevant to this case because Congress has simply never exercised any real authority over the levels of welfare allowance is paid by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.392" offset="10952913">Indeed, 601 of the Social Security Act which is the basic statute which provides the federal grants and aid in the field that AFDC says the states ought to furnish assistance as far as practicable under the conditions in each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.707" offset="11006203">And what that means in effect is we've seen is that New York pays $278.00 a month, Missouri pays $124.00, Mississippi pays $55.00 a month and even the District of Columbia where Congress is 4537 pays $184.00 a month on the average which is about 2/3's of what New York pays.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.070" offset="11079659">Now, while imposing various other requirements as a condition of receiving federal grants, Congress has deliberately refrain from mandating levels and indeed it even perpetuates to some extent the inequity between the states by scaling the ratio of the federal contribution so as to give more money for the state's that pay less paradoxically enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.599" offset="11161788">And indeed in King against Smith which was decided after 602 (a) (23) was enacted by the 67th Congress, this Court said “Each state is free to determine the level of benefits by the amount of funds that devotes for the program.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.982" offset="11215287">The statute requires an increase in the standard of need, there's no question about that and New York complied with that by its reprising in 1968 and it's again reprised in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.323" offset="11260635">The Bill when it was originally introduced by the administration made significant changes which never took effect because Congress didn't see it the way HEW saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.868" offset="11302849">The Bill has introduced required each state to pay the full standard of need which as we've seen would be a gigantic step forward in the whole administration of welfare and many states, 26 according the count we took, don't even pay their own acknowledged standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.366" offset="11368887">In effect they say to a family, “We know you need $300.00 a month or whatever it is but we're not going to give you $300.00 a month.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.921" offset="11399084">The Bill also required an annual adjustment of the standard of need and since it required each state to pay the standard of need, it required an annual adjustment of the amount actually paid to every AFDC recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.241" offset="11444328">This would've been a Bill of enormous impact but the House turned it down and the Senate, while passing a portion of it only passed the annual updating part so where in effect when it finally got through, it was emasculated and then the House-Senate Conference Committee further emasculated it by eliminating the annual updating and leaving it as it is with a simple one-shot updating of the standard of need requirement and no requirements at all that a state increased the amount actually paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.859" offset="12326849">The fact is that this statute requires no more than a one-shot adjustment of the standard of need and that inescapably raises a question of fundamental jurisdiction over and above the question of ripeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.152" offset="12368018">Supposed the petitioners construction of the statute were correct, then it would place the judiciary in a position of having to categorically order the New York legislature, assuming that this court found we didn't comply, to disperse money from each treasury in the absence of any claim of any constitutional infirmity such as it was involved in King against Smith.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.715" offset="13166216">I'll be finishing up in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.094" offset="13179800">When we turn to the question of jurisdiction, the reason the Court of Appeals found in the District Court lacked jurisdiction here is that once the equal protection claim of the geographical differential between the City of New York and the rest of the state was mooted as it was, there remained only the statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.736" offset="13254301">And there was simply no authority for the judiciary entertaining that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.677" offset="13274049">The petitioners have tried to avoid that problem by saying that dependent jurisdiction doctrine gets them over that hurdle, but it simple doesn't because this Court held in United Mine Workers against Gibbs and as the lower federal courts have held on many occasions when the only constitutional issue in the case, the only issue where there's federal jurisdiction is knocked out early in the case then for the District Court to retain jurisdiction would amount to the non-justiciable tail wagging the justiciable dog, as the Court very colorfully put it in one of the cases and that that's simply what we have here so pending jurisdictions have no assistance to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.351" offset="13424828">They rely on 1331 but it's clear that they don't have $10,000.00 here to talk about and as this Court held in Schneider against Harris individual plaintiffs and a class suit can't aggregate their claims in order to try to reach the $10,000.00 requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.994" offset="13491388">They also rely on 1343 and 42 U.S.C. 1983 the classic civil right statutes, but the fallacy there, as the Court of Appeals held, was that 402 (a) (23) simply can't be construed as a statute designed to bring about civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.131" offset="13559933">What it does, is a statute which really perpetuates in inequity to the extent that there's any effect at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.868" offset="13582817">It -- it locks the states into the extraordinarily inequitable amounts of welfare assistance that they pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.937" offset="13607163">This statute as enacted requires the states to adjust their standard of need and New York did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.314" offset="13628583">It's a narrow statute and this is a narrow case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.241" offset="13640286">There are many defects in the welfare system as we look at it throughout the whole country and there've been many proposals for solution but the Congress has itself maintained as we've seen vast and equalities by its refusal to act and equalize the payments in the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.920" offset="13699009">To adopt the petitioner's view of the statute would not end these severe inequities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.159" offset="13716041">And to argue that New York contravened it, when it so plainly didn't and that any non-conformity between this New York State Statute and 602 (a) (23) would void the entire state program in the absence of any claim of unconstitutionality or discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.425" offset="13777063">It's simply at odds with the plain meaning of their statute and its an invitation to just that sort of judicial consideration of questions of legislative policy of the states, which this Court since the cases in the 1930's has correctly resisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.654" offset="13834010">The order of appeal from should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.829" offset="13878732">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.433" offset="13881135">We know of no case requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies or primary jurisdiction in which the litigant being harmed by a statute has no access to that agency and may not initiate any proceeding and may not participate in any proceeding before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.383" offset="13940903">We think that that was obvious to this Court in King against Smith, in Damico against California and in Salmon against Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.539" offset="13965563">We don't think that that requires a reexamination; we don't think it should be -- we don't think the rule should be any different in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.454" offset="14001194">The result of a decree in this case is not necessarily greater or lesser than any other violation of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.192" offset="14028152">After all, in King against Smith, Alabama reduced its roles by 25% through its substitute for the rule, that's lot of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.338" offset="14056678">True, it could turned to its benefit levels that's a lot of money involved in King v. Smith, the Louisiana sued the Home Ruins, similarly involved a great deal of many people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.929" offset="14095130">There's no intrinsic or (Inaudible) in age distinction between benefit levels and scope with eligibility very much depends on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.225" offset="14136299">This Court is not called upon to decide whether New York has eliminated basic items or non-basic items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.108" offset="14159809">Section 402 (a) (23) does talk after all of the items used to determine need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.625" offset="14181857">In the context of this case however find questions about an item a need no longer existing, it does not arise or find questions that the state substituting oil for coal as a way of fulfilling your need for fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.612" offset="14237863">Those kinds of questions are not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.718" offset="14250193">As the findings below amply support it may clear, this is an overall streamlining so to speak to reduce welfare AFDC expenditures for one year in New York by $100 million as the HEW makes clear for July 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.636" offset="14305886">Its average went from $71.00 per person to $62.00 per person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.256" offset="14324381">I -- there's something more going on there than so called streamlining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.018" offset="14343398">Moreover, if one looks to the two primary ways New York accomplished this, it took to age differentiated schedules giving a great deal more for older children and did a way with the differentials for older children not because they don't have greater requirements for food or social or educational necessities, but because it wanted to save money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.356" offset="14436812">It justifies that at some sort of convenience in administration by saying “We'd have to change it every two years otherwise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.024" offset="14463457">New recertifies individuals every three months and makes countless adjustments to the grant every month for every dollar of resource or income received on any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.405" offset="14500968">How New York is saying “Let's look at two figures in a chart and to have to make an adjustment and ADC families granting to every two years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.517" offset="14529390">Somehow, its administrative inefficiency boggles the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.197" offset="14544123">The large other item eliminated are supplementary grants for clothing and home furnishings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.912" offset="14567006">Those were administered in New York as a flat grant not a special grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.808" offset="14582575">No one applied for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.770" offset="14586441">They got a check in the mail every quarter of $25.00 per person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.733" offset="14606294">There's no administrative efficiency in eliminating that whatsoever, there's cost saving and nothing more.</text>
