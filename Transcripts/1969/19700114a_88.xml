            <label>Mr. Shiro Kashiwa</label>
            <text syncTime="25.460" offset="205197">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.878" offset="214915">This is a review of a session of the Sixth Circuit relating to the scope of project rule expressed by this Court in the Miller case in 1943, 317 U.S. 369.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.870" offset="294849">Briefly, the factual situation was first of all, this had to do with the Nolin Reservoir Project in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.492" offset="345318">The Reynolds owned a total of 390 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.534" offset="373530">The present case is a case of partial taking of 250 acres out of the 390, in other words after the taking in this case they were a 140 acres remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.688" offset="438105">Out of the 250 acres, 172 acres were for inundation and 78 acres were for recreational purposes and it's the 78 acres which causes the question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.000" offset="535385">Now, with relation to the project, the project was congressionally authorized way back in 1958 as a flood control plan for the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.254" offset="600377">Incidentally, after 1938, in 1944, congress has passed the special statute authorizing acquisition of recreational areas in conjunction with reservoir projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.915" offset="671013">In 1956, planning funds were appropriated for the Nolin project and in July 1958, a general design memoranda was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.532" offset="749484">This design memoranda, contained contemplated recreational areas definitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.318" offset="792639">In September 1958, funds were provided by congress for the project and in January 1959, the project was started.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.598" offset="845720">In October 1959, this 78 acres for recreational purpose was specifically set aside in a memo by the United States Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.132" offset="919907">In April 18th 1962, a suit was filed and declaration of taking filed in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.285" offset="956479">Incidentally going back, the Reynolds's purchased this property in October of 1959, a portion of it in October 59 and the balance of it in 1960, of course before the case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.930" offset="1051042">We have to go into the proceedings in the trial court to fully understand the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.359" offset="1072776">In the trial court, the Court held with relation to any enhancement testimony as to the 78 acres, this is a recreation area.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.726" offset="1138291">The Court held that it is a question for the trial court to decide and it held that it held that it will not allow any enhancement testimony, this is in the original, the first portion of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.468" offset="1221256">But just before the case went to the jury, the Court changed its mind and said no as to whether the 78 acres was within the scope of the project or not, it will allow the jury to consider and so the owners put on testimony with relation to the 78 acres with and without enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.242" offset="1352391">The case went to the jury and the jury in this case filed that the land was probably within the scope of the project under the instructions of the Court, if that was so then enhancement was not to be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.066" offset="1435669">Therefore, the jury returned a verdict of only $20,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.190" offset="1464090">In the Court of Appeals, the Court also following the trial court held that whether it was in the scope of the project this question was before the jury, but the Appellant Court reversed the case as $20,000.00 verdict because the jury was allowed to consider facts which were not an evidence, it happened in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.962" offset="1583208">The Court at first took the scope of the project question and testimony was adduced only before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.434" offset="1617063">But later when it changed its mind, the witnesses testified but government attorney did not cover the testimony as fully as he did just before the Court but he remembered -- but the Court in considering the evidence --- commenting on the evidence went back to the evidence he heard while he was sitting at the Court and in this mix up, the grounds for reversal came up, I will go back to this later.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.243" offset="1760319">So the issue -- the first issue in this case is whether the scope of the project question is a determination for the Court or for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.335" offset="1808697">This Court in Miller in the Miller case, a case with substantially similar factual background as in this case held that it was for the trial court to rule upon and not a jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.246" offset="1888319">In that case, the respondents, when he tried it to put on evidence with relation to the valuation of the particular parcel and the government attorney objected because whatever he offered included enhancement and the Court took part in the questioning and specifically directed the witness not to include that enhancement in that testimony and this was a direct ruling by the Court on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.279" offset="2052472">But in the latter part of the opinion there is a reference to jury instructions given by the Court and with relation to these instructions, the Court commented that these instructions were not wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.595" offset="2133765">It's this portion of the -- this Court's decision that has caused much difficulty in the Courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.821" offset="2162604">I maintain that the opinion means and it meant that it was a question for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.366" offset="2188831">The later comment in the instruction, it was really not an instruction given the jury any leeway as to deciding one way or the other, it was a comment by the Court that you shall not with relation to this lot consider enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.151" offset="2263960">But that was taken by the Sixth Circuit as well as the trial court to mean, well, there are two portions of this decision and therefore will let the jury we have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.336" offset="2324668">We contend that that's a wrongful interpretation of what this Court held because the evidence of enhancement was not allowed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.190" offset="2376182">How could the jury consider enhancement when it didn't have any evidence of enhancement before it?</text>
            <text syncTime="576.086" offset="2407737">So that was a purely warning type of instruction and it's our position that as stated in the Wardy case, at Fifth Circuit Court decision which followed the Miller case as we interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.144" offset="2499897">The Circuit Court in the Fifth Circuit well put it, “the judge decides illegal question which limits the factors to the determination of just compensation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="621.835" offset="2590699">We further point to rule 71 (a) (h) adopted in 1951, this is the rule that has to do with eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.970" offset="2635212">In essence, taken all the portion with relation to jury commissioners and all of that out, as material in this case, it reads, any party may have a trial by jury of the issue of compensation, then it further states, trial of all issues shall otherwise be by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.542" offset="2761540">As I said this rule was adopted after the Miller decision but we contend that the rule is perfectly consistent with our position that legal questions which limit the factors to the determination of just compensation for the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.690" offset="2838131">In fact, when we redo, it reads very much in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.619" offset="2861850">We do it admit that it does say, any party may have trial by jury of the issue of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.161" offset="2908035">What our opponents are saying anything that has remotely to do with this compensation should be tried by the jury, we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.098" offset="2959757">For various reasons, we contend that in most of these recreational area cases, there are quite a few of these, the government relies and also the respondent relies on the records of the Engineers and in this case, if looking at both briefs as far as the records of the Engineers there's no dispute as to the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.996" offset="3095385">The personnel of the engineer, engineers come and testifies and that's so, that all of this events happen on so and so a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.103" offset="3135822">Now, some of these facts could become very, very complicated, it's not a simple as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.944" offset="3175111">We have a case called the Crans case from the Eighth Circuit, which not only -- there was a general indication of recreational areas and then the recreational area was determined but they also have public hearings and at the time of this public hearings the public attends and sometimes this areas are changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.577" offset="3285661">In other words they become very, very complicated and usually as I have said before in the Crans case, the facts, there were no disputes as to the records of the engineer's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.579" offset="3349713">And so both counsels stipulated, well, that's a question for the Court, there's nothing to argue about this that the Court decided and by a preliminary hearing, a very orderly way to decide a case --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="827.229" stopTime="831.024">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="827.229" offset="3412302">Well, isn't the Court decides on these records?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="shiro_kashiwa" startTime="831.024" stopTime="1005.186">
            <label>Mr. Shiro Kashiwa</label>
            <text syncTime="831.024" offset="3427453">Whether the area in dispute is within the scope of the project in the Reynolds' case.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.695" offset="3466115">If it's within the scope of the project then enhancement is not allowed, enhancement by the very general project that matters through.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.397" offset="3512926">Now, in the Crans case as I said these engineering -- engineers facts were rather complicated but it was disposed off in that manner and I think very sensibly so and where there isn't much -- there isn't any dispute as to material facts, it should be for the Court and within this -- this preliminary question in the Crans case -- there appeared to subsidiary questions, one question of governmental estoppel because of certain facts, and secondly, authorized or unauthorized act of government officials, these issues aroused.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.073" offset="3703620">So, looking at the Crans case you readily realize that these issues could be very, very complicated and it's not the type of thing of question for the jury and especially so where the facts are not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.206" offset="3792227">Another policy reason I'd like to advance is much as possible in this kind of a case, evaluation testimony which is not material should not be allowed to the jury, there maybe abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.596" offset="3853772">Now, in the Court below, let's take the trial below to be consistent with relation to the 172 acres which is the inundated area, there's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.545" offset="3913540">The enhancement is not allowed and of course it wasn't raised but that's the way the testimony is put in and partly, if anybody raises the question the Court will rule, the enhancement will not be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.565" offset="3977592">Now, what about with the 140 acres, which remained under the eminent domain rules that is an after value so the enhancement is added off to the remainder of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.347" offset="4084799">The Judge in this case rule that enhancement will be added on, that was the question for the Judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.857" offset="4202768">Yeah, the enhancement is added on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.388" offset="4224920">In other words, the party does not benefit by the enhanced value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.242" offset="4252296">Now, those were decided as preliminary questions by the Court, so why not with relation to the 78 acres?</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.242" offset="4292315">Now, if the Court with respect to this question rules that it is a question before the Court because of the peculiar way the verdicts were returned, our position is that the Sixth Circuit must be reversed, its not a question for the jury, the Circuit Court held it was for the jury so it must be reversed with relation to that but our position is that the verdict for $20,000.00 must be sustained because the jury so found that this is the value without the enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.359" offset="4452812">Now, with relation if this Court decides the other way that it is a question for the jury then we had meant that the case must be remanded and a retrial had because facts outside the record were considered by the jury, at least it was allowed to be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.560" offset="5121651">Now, we request because of the various rules that have develop under this Miller rule, we would like to have the Court clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.595" offset="5181733">The rule and this we asked in our petition that this be done and it was granted by this Court and the Miller rule has been interpreted in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.216" offset="5260204">The Third Circuit has said that there must be an indication at the outset of the project that a particular track or area will be acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.673" offset="5314017">Now, this we contend is a very narrow rule, that's a Third Circuit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.929" offset="5343065">In the Eight Circuit, it is sufficient, if it is clear that some land will be taken even though the particular land is not identified, that is the rule in the circuit and the Eight Circuit and that was the rule in the Miller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.143" offset="5419969">We contend and I call this the Department of Justice rule that the rule should be parted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.195" offset="5448182">The only requirement is that the land was within the general area influenced by the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.821" offset="5482663">And we maintain that that should be the rule because the basic reason in the as stated in the Miller case was that owners are not to gain by speculating on probable increase in value due to governmental activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.454" offset="5561240">In other words, the government should not pay for the value it creates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.636" offset="5593945">Another reason why the Third Circuit and the Eight Circuit rules are unduly harsh on the government, if those rules expect -- adopted be very difficult to change projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.247" offset="5656325">Not the whole project but the scope in lines of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.219" offset="5688299">As I stated at the Crans case for example, the public were here -- instead of the recreation area being here, they wanted it over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.684" offset="5722154">And these changes are made the engineers, but that should not affect the individual owners because it is within the conduct, the recreational areas were contemplated and the fact that we take it shouldn't change the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.080" offset="5819643">If the Third Circuit and the Eight Circuit rules are approved, we contend that perhaps government will mark out a very large project as large as it should and then take with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.125" offset="5891845">This is what the government did in the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.951" offset="5935208">Then we also contend that these rules should be consistent with relation to the 140 acres which was not taken; this is at the most -- we talk about enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.133" offset="6003858">We don't have much many strict rules as to that, it will -- if the remaining parcel while the value was enhanced, we added on to that value that's all that's to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.710" offset="6066239">In other words, it's in the general vicinity and it has been influenced by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.223" offset="6100302">Now, what the word scope of the project, we finally contend as used in the Miller case meant under the influence of the project, this is what it really means, and if we adopt this view which is a view broader than the Third Circuit and the Eight Circuit, I think that justice be done in all of these cases and government will not be paying for the value it creates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.198" offset="6260172">This is very, very important for we taxpayers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.956" offset="6407189">The Miller -- the Miller case and I will go into the factual situation in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.850" offset="6434774">But the Miller case, we say stand for the proposition that if in the original design over project, the land is delineated to be taken or as in the Miller case if it were marked out or designated that it would probably be taken, then there is no enhanced value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.621" offset="6569880">If it's in the original scope and the original plans, no one has value or as the in the Miller case, where there was a railroad right of way over areas to be flooded and they had marked out amusement, the terminology of the Court in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.030" offset="6651486">Marked out or designated where this right of way should be that's why they used the words probably would have taken or when the government was committed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.079" offset="6699656">And those two instances, we state that there would be no enhancement, however, as in our case where the government in its original desire and then in a later desire did not take in the property, the 78 acres but later did so in a third memo, as we say an after thought then we believe we are entitled to the enhance value of that land.</text>
