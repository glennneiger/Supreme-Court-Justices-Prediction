            <text syncTime="43.743" offset="278340">I am the counsel for the appellants in this proceeding which involves a direct appeal from the District Court for the District of Connecticut where a three-judge panel dismissed appellant's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.864" offset="330794">Appellants had alleged that they are welfare recipients who seek to divorce their husbands in the Courts of Connecticut, but could not afford to pay the court costs imposed by the State of Connecticut of roughly $60.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.020" offset="399444">They further alleged that the Connecticut Court officials had refused to waive those costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.035" offset="427551">Appellant sought an injunction on the basis that the fee statute was unconstitutional, requesting the District Court to order the Connecticut Courts to accept appellant's divorce papers for filing and to arrange service of process.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.509" offset="609364">Before appearing here today, I asked one of the people attached to the neighborhood office where I was formerly employed to check with the appellants to make certain that they are in fact still interested in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.750" offset="666415">Because of the shortage of time, only four of the remaining seven were contacted, they are still married after a fashion and still emphatically undivorced and still unable to raise the fees necessary to initiate a divorce proceeding in Connecticut.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="159.101" offset="739767">How much of a showing have they made with respect to their indigency if you wish to call it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.794" offset="798595">And second has any showing then brought up to date from March of 1968 to now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur B. LaFrance</label>
            <text syncTime="182.459" offset="833181">With response to the first or in response to the first question Your Honor, the showing which was submitted to the Courts of Connecticut and to the District Court consisted of affidavits which appear in the Appendix in this Court indicating the family situation, the income situation, the economic responsibilities of the appellants and we would argue clearly establishing indigency at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.131" offset="943940">Now, we've never had an evidentiary hearing on the issue of indigency because this case was resolved in the District Court on the pleadings and for the purposes of this appeal and for the purposes of the District Court, indigency was conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.624" offset="1013844">At the present time, there is nothing before this Court updating that showing of some two and half years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.606" offset="1045817">I suppose if this Court were to hold in favor of the appellants, a remand would be appropriate and if that time as to any of the appellants in the case, the state would have an opportunity to challenge their indigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.794" offset="1110497">It is appellant's contention that the conduct of the appellees has denied the Due Process rights specifically and particularly with respect to the right to petition for redress and grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.138" offset="1171937">This is a right which appears in the First Amendment is incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as reflected in the decisions of this Court such as NAACP versus Button, United Mine Workers versus Illinois Decision, Railway Train Man versus Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.755" offset="1254379">The right to petition as this Court has recognized, there's a fundamental right as long ago as Chambers versus Baltimore on Ohio Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.116" offset="1291786">This Court said that the right to sue and defend in the courts is the alternative of force in an organized society, it is the right conservative of all other rights and lies at the foundations of orderly Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.400" offset="1353017">Since this case was argued last year, two decisions of this Court have been rendered which I feel bear upon the position of the appellants, at least with respect to their Due Process argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.424" offset="1409024">I refer to Sniadach versus Family Finance and Goldberg versus Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.395" offset="1432952">Essentially, both of those cases held that before the property interest of a citizen can be impaired or affected by state action, a hearing must be a for due.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.306" offset="1500557">The appellants seek that very same hearing, and yet their position is more critical than that of the position of the appellants in Goldberg versus Kelly and in Sniadach because in this instance, not only have the appellants been denied a prior hearing which was the issue in Sniadach and Goldberg but they have been denied any hearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.769" offset="1594493">They have simply been denied the opportunity to seek a divorce in the Courts of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.975" offset="1623228">For this reason, appellants maintain their right to Due Process has been denied of equal importance is the other aspect of our argument which relates to the right to Equal Protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.026" offset="1707447">As long ago, as 1941, Mr. Justice Jackson wrote in Edwards versus California that the mere state of being without funds is a neutral fact constitutionally and irrelevant, like race, creed or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.771" offset="1778500">More recent decisions of this Court have indicated that poverty, like race is a suspect criteria, and when a state discriminates among its citizens upon the basis of poverty, then it must make the same showing to justify that discrimination as would be required if the discrimination were racial.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.109" offset="1875780">Mr. LaFrance, let me follow through a little bit on your Equal Protection argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.262" offset="1900440">Suppose instead of wanting the divorce, your clients wanted to get married and the marriage license worth $3.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.875" offset="1938892">Would you say that Equal Protection demands that they be given the marriage license without payment of the fee?</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur B. LaFrance</label>
            <text syncTime="465.679" offset="1966059">I would Your Honor, if a demonstration were made that in point of fact, they could not afford that fee, and the reason is simply this; although a dog license for example may not affect the matter of constitutional import, this Court is said that marriage appropriation are basic civil liberties of man, and I refer to Loving versus Virginia, Skinner versus Oklahoma and Griswold versus Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.532" offset="2093537">And so, the appellant's position would be that whenever a fee is attached to a state franchised activity which is of constitutional magnitude, then that fee must be waived on behalf of an indigent.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.458" offset="2217253">We're primarily concerned or we're particularly concerned about divorce in this case because it carries with it the right to marry or re-marry I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.202" offset="2260198">The right to procreate with someone other than the present spouse, so that in the context of this case, divorce and marriage are very closely linked.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.642" offset="2557889">Taking that statement as a given at accepting it, then I would argue further that conditioning a basic civil liberty on the ability to pay for it is an impermissible state regulation of constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="666.786" offset="2770526">The difference was not that they weren't rights or interests in both cases, but that the right in Shapiro versus Thompson was deemed to be a constitutional right, the right of free travel in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.449" offset="2825174">Whereas in Williams versus Dandridge, the majority of this Court concluded that although there were interests being affected by the state's economic regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.488" offset="5441285">The fee system does not deter frivolous litigation or if it does, it does so only with respect to the poor and as to them, it deters all litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.996" offset="5483395">It does not provide revenues, at least not from the poor because they aren't able to pay the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.037" offset="5511502">It does not particularly or at least measurably conserve revenue or facilities or services in the court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.545" offset="5541595">And even if it did, it has never been held or believed to my knowledge that that cost of constitutionally imposed burdens relieves the states from fulfilling those -- their duties under those burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.698" offset="5602200">In Shapiro versus Thompson, this Court said that we recognized that if State has a valid interest in preserving the physical integrity of its programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.918" offset="5643055">But a State may not accomplish such a purpose by invidious discrimination between classes of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.895" offset="5670954">It could not for example, reduce its expenditures for school by barring indigent children, and yet the State of Connecticut is attempting to reduce its expenditures for courts by barring indigent litigants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.038" offset="5787564">They must show more of compelling necessity for imposing court fees upon the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.642" offset="5817971">This Court in Shapiro versus Thompson which I just quoted from said in essence that only a compelling necessity could justify discriminating among citizens on suspect criteria such as poverty or race, and discriminating in a manner which affects important rights such as the petition for redress of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.862" offset="5914833">We ask this Court to reverse the court below to give the relief which appellants seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.507" offset="5937403">And in so doing, we have maintained in the last brief which we submitted to this Court that a holding in favor appellants can be narrowly based and narrowly limited in its implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.953" offset="5987140">This case involves a specific constitutional guarantee, the right to petition for redress of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.589" offset="6017755">It involves litigation concerning matters of constitutional magnitude marriage appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.597" offset="6049729">Further, it involves matters which cannot be settled privately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.628" offset="6065925">The State of Connecticut has said to these appellants that they cannot resolve their affairs privately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.886" offset="6086928">They must go into state courts to seek the relief they need, and yet at the same time, has barred them from those Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.770" offset="6122454">A holding emphasizing these factors, for example, would not compel a later holding that counsel be appointed in civil cases or a later holding that fees for the use of golf greens in a public golf course must be waived for the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.200" offset="6212211">A useful analog for this case is Goldberg versus Kelly where this Court considered the meaning of Due Process in welfare termination cases and concluded that a hearing is the essence of Due Process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.983" offset="7131303">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.906" offset="7150947">To understand what's really at stake in this case perhaps it's rather outlined briefly the procedures followed in divorce actions are civil actions in Connecticut, all civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.753" offset="7218343">First of all, of course, the client sees the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.687" offset="7230151">The attorney discernments whether it has a cause of action and draws a writ which is delivered to the officer to make service at the expense of the client or and then the officer returns the writ to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.778" offset="7294516">At that time, the statute comes into play, and says the clerk for the Court shall charge $45.00 for entering all civil causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.924" offset="7335058">That's the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.119" offset="7351881">To accomplish the relief sought by the plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.291" offset="7388557">It is necessary that some provision also be made to pay these auxiliary costs which are incident to the divorce cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.997" offset="7435368">Very often there's expensive advertisement or publication particularly when the defendant is absent from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.519" offset="7477478">Now in this complaint, another thought we must bear in mind, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.820" offset="7490644">In this complaint, the only plaintiffs are women on welfares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.607" offset="7517811">They are not poor people generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.396" offset="7532962">There's thousands of poor people as everyone knows who are working their head's off to try to make a living in case that they're only together and resent or check on the welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.310" offset="7572564">And that class of people who's entitled of relief as this well as these people, if they are entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.474" offset="7625226">At presently, the court raised the thought, what has been done since the last time we were here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.091" offset="7659708">Presently, we find all inability, welfare women or other poor people to get divorce cases, divorce actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.631" offset="7717909">There are as plenty of them handled by the legal assistance association.</text>
