            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="40.613" offset="265801">May it please the Court, this is a tax case what we might call a regular tax case, not a criminal case nor a land case as the last two were which comes here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.818" offset="362663">The basic factual situation is simple, the statutory provisions are somewhat complex but I think reduced to a relatively simple problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.278" offset="424521">The case arises with respect to a family corporation which was set up in 1945 by Mr. Davis, the taxpayer here and his partner, Mr. Bradley.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.025" offset="487424">At that time, Bradley had 50% of the stock and Davis had 25% and Davis' wife had 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.292" offset="536534">They sought to barrow $95,000.00 from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or a subsidiary of it but found that they could do so only if the company had more capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.715" offset="594213">Bradley was unwilling to increase his investment and so it was worked out by Davis acquiring $25,000.00 in preferred stock from the company for which he paid cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.999" offset="663385">Some years later, Davis purchased Bradley's stock and transferred it in equal shares to his son and to his daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.333" offset="716675">As a result of this transaction, the stock was held four ways and Davis owned 25%, his wife 25%, his son 25%, and his daughter 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.731" offset="790340">And Davis himself owned all of the preferred stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.715" offset="822209">In June 1963, the RFC loan was finally paid off and thereafter on October 1, 1963 pursuant to a corporate resolution, Mr. Davis turned in his preferred stock and received $25,000 from the corporation, and this is the transaction which is at issue here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="209.396" stopTime="217.267">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="209.396" offset="940910">Is there any question as to whether or not the time of the redemption of the preferred stock, there were earnings and profits?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="217.267" stopTime="446.814">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="217.267" offset="972466">No, there's no question about that Mr. Justice, there were adequate earnings and profits to cover this.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.628" offset="997857">The question is whether under the applicable provisions of the statute, the $25,000.00 is taxable as a dividend or whether it was received in exchange for the preferred stock resulting in no tax, since the amount received, $25,000.00 was the same as Mr. Davis' basis for the preferred stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.560" offset="1101615">Before going further, I would like to make it plain that this is simply a matter of construing a rather specific and somewhat intricate statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.935" offset="1143097">There is no suggestion of tax avoidance or that Mr. Davis set up any sort of scheme for artificially reducing his taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.162" offset="1179982">The fact is that he received $25,000.00 from the corporation and that he turned in his preferred stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.557" offset="1213628">The question is what the tax consequences of this were and the circumstances of this case and under the applicable statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.428" offset="1261066">It's clear I think that this is a situation where Congress had power under the Sixteenth Amendment to impose a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.502" offset="1301400">For that purpose, the basic fact is that $25,000.00 was separated from the corporation and was received by Mr. Davis to which I may add as indicated in my response to Mr. Justice Stewart that the corporation had earnings and profits and at least that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.295" offset="1384573">This is not a case like Eisner and Macomber, the stock dividend case where the taxpayer received only pieces of paper and ended with more pieces of paper representing exactly the same interest that he had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.005" offset="1447372">Here, the shareholder received cash and had fewer pieces of paper than he had before that receipt, and the question is how the receipt of the cash is to be treated for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.719" offset="1506200">Basic to the consideration of that question is the provision of Section 318 of the Internal Revenue Code which is set out at pages 43 and 44 of the Government's recovered brief insofar as it is relevant to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.732" offset="1610271">This is one of the two key provisions in the statute and I think that I should read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.927" offset="1635035">Section 318 at the bottom of page 43 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.743" offset="1654366">For purposes of those provisions of this subchapter to which the rules contained in this section are expressly made applicable 1 (a), an individual shall be considered as owning the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for his spouse other than a spouse who is divorced or under a decree of separate maintenance which is not applicable here, and two, his children, grandchildren and parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.356" offset="1800756">Now, under this statute, Mr. Davis “shall be considered” not maybe or improper circumstances but “shall be considered” as owning all the stock of the corporation, every share, all the common and all the preferred.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="446.814" stopTime="453.953">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="454.723" offset="1922278">--assume the father is 75-years old and the son 50-years old and they hadn't seen each other for 30-years, and one lived in Europe and the other lived in California, is it supposed there's still be attribute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="467.974" stopTime="516.804">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="467.974" offset="1975254">Yes Mr. Justice because I think the very purpose of the statute is to remove the questions of degree which could be raised by that kind of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.199" offset="2020185">It is true that some lower courts have said that Section 318 should not be applied where there is evidence of active hostility between the parties, that is not an issue here, there is no trace of evidence of hostility here but I would take the ground that Congress felt that this was an area which should not be determined by the facts in each particular case, are they really friendly and so on as to which there can be infinite variation but that its language as written should be taken as written.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="516.804" stopTime="520.528">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="516.804" offset="2170546">And you don't think children -- I mean minor children or anything like that</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="520.528" stopTime="1352.736">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="520.528" offset="2185488">No, I'm sure that that does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.656" offset="2201997">It covers parents too so it's obviously not limited to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.276" offset="2224462">One can say if he want to but he didn't owned all the stock, some was owned by his wife, his son and his daughter, but the fact is that Congress had said specifically that the tax consequences of what was done here shall be determined by treating him as the owner of all of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.817" offset="2298650">And for this purpose, I think that those last three words at the very bottom on page 43 shall be considered without qualification, are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.649" offset="2345984">No suggestion is made either by the counsel for the respondent or in the courts below that the provision is not valid and I know of no basis on which such a contention could be successfully made.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.756" offset="2402408">This is the way the congress said that tax consequences of this sort of a payment out of a corporation should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.768" offset="2438457">So, we start with the proposition that Mr. Davis is to be treated as owning all of the stock of the company from which he received $25,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.197" offset="2484120">Let me point out next that Section 318 (b) which is about four inches below the top of page 44 and set out on page 44 of our brief specifically refers to Section 302 as being one of the provisions to which Section 318 applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.968" offset="2563218">That is a cross reference of provision but it says for provisions to which the rules contained in subsection (a) applies (c) (1), Section 302 relating to redemption of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.672" offset="2622046">Let us then turn to Section 302.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.404" offset="2636988">This is a long provision beginning on page 39 of our brief, we have set it out in full there but most of it, the appellee is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.362" offset="2700831">The relevant portions are relatively simple of Section 302 (a), if a corporation redeems its stock within the meaning of Section 317 (b) and if paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection (b) applies, such redemption shall be treated as a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.072" offset="2831653">Now, what that means is that if you can bring yourself under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4), then it will be treated as a capital transaction and not as a dividend, and the first one of those four paragraphs, 302 (b) (1), subsection (a) shall apply if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.963" offset="2955264">Now, actually can refer to subsection (b) (2), (3) and (4), only to say that everyone agrees that they are not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.292" offset="3012524">302 (b) (4) relates to stock issued by railroad corporations and reorganizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.720" offset="3042304">302 (b) (2) relates to a substantially disproportionate redemption of stock and 302 (b) (3) relates to a redemptions which terminates the shareholder's interest and it is entirely agreed that (2), (3), and (4) are not applicable and this case turns on the construction of Section 302 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="764.992" offset="3163303">We may complete the statutory picture though there is no controversy about it in this case by referring to Section 301, which provides that if Section 302 does not apply, and we contend that it does not, the distribution shall be treated as a dividend to the extent that it is a dividend under Section 316, which means essentially whether there are earnings and profits and Section 316 says that it is a dividend if there are earnings and profits, the statutory path is, shall I say disorderly and complicated but I think it is relevant, relatively clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.448" offset="3357132">It's relevant I think that there is nothing in these statutory provisions about business purpose or about tax avoidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.155" offset="3403943">These are simply a straight forward series of provisions designed to say that in certain circumstances, a payment made by a corporation to a shareholder is to be treated and taxed as a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.799" offset="3478549">As I've indicated when we go through all these statutory provisions, we find that the key passage, the clause on which everything turns is Section 302 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="860.236" offset="3544273">It's awkwardly stated I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.174" offset="3560051">Its meaning becomes clearer I think if we reverse the negatives, then it would say subsection (a) which would treat it as a capital transaction shall not apply if the redemption is essentially equivalent to a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.137" offset="3651897">Now, what it says is that subsection (a) shall apply if the distribution -- if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend that puts it backwards I think and to me it's clear and I don't think it alters the meaning of particle.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.687" offset="3726085">If it says that subsection (a) shall not apply, if the redemption is essentially equivalent to a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.070" offset="3755656">Either way, the question which we must consider is whether this redemption in this case under the circumstances and the statutory provisions was essentially equivalent to a dividend, and it's our contention that the transaction here was in the light of the attribution rules of Section 318, essentially equivalent to a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.157" offset="3864012">It was the payment of money out of a corporation to the person who under Section 318 is to be treated as owning all of the stock of the corporation without any change whatever in his proportionate interest in the corporation since he is taxed on the basis that he owned all of the stock of the corporation, before the payment, and owned all of the stock of the corporation after the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.131" offset="3999848">Such a payment by a corporation to a shareholder without any change in proportion and interest is, we submit, under many decisions of the Courts essentially equivalent to a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.372" offset="4076857">Section 302 (b) (1) is the linear descendant of a provision which goes back to 1921, when it was first enacted at that time, it was applicable only to stock which had been issued as a stock dividend and it was a part of the aftermath of Eisner and Macomber, the great scheme at that time was that you declared a preferred dividend on your common stock and then you immediately redeem the preferred dividend and the theory was that that wasn't taxable and the statute passed in 1921 was designed to reach that type of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.998" offset="4243414">It was soon found however that it wasn't limited to that kind of a situation, you could organize a corporation with serial preferred stock and then redeem the preferred stock year by year and seek to get around it and I make it, I repeat again, there is no suggestion that there was any tax avoidance scheme whatever involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.096" offset="4335783">In 1926, the statutory provision was expanded to recover redemptions without regard to the origin of the stock, however, that provision which became Section 115 (g) (1) of the internal revenue code was worded somewhat differently than the present provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.015" offset="4419480">It made a redemption taxable as a dividend if it was made “at such time and in such manner” as to make the distribution and cancellation or redemption in whole or in part essentially equivalent to the distribution of a taxable dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.636" offset="4501922">It was probably because of those words “at such time and in such manner” that some of the lower courts used concepts of business purpose and tax avoidance in construing that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.932" offset="4563048">They said, well if there was a legitimate business purpose or if there was no scheme of tax avoidance, then it was not at such time and in such manner but there are no such words in Section 302 (b) (1) of the 54 code which is the provision now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.323" offset="4640684">We have here the simple question whether the payment was essentially equivalent to a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.993" offset="4675375">The taxpayer wants to treat this payment as if it were payment of a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.260" offset="4700453">He says he always understood that it would be paid off, his position is made clear at page 3 of his brief in opposition in this case from which I read two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.139" offset="4771924">Here moreover, there was a clearly identifiable date as of which the preferred stock was to be redeemed, the date of payment in full of the RFC debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.165" offset="4824064">In this respect, the preferred stock was like a subordinated debt, but there was no debt, there was preferred stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.081" offset="4875682">This was a payment with respect to stock which under the attribution rules did not in any way affect the proportionate ownership in the corporation which for tax purposes in pursuant to the expressed provision of the statute which represented Congress's statement as to how transactions of this kind should be treated for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.494" offset="4985396">For tax purposes, his ownership was 100%, both before and after the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.268" offset="5024475">Nor could this be treated as a partial liquidation of the corporation, for that requires some contraction of the business of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.358" offset="5064808">Here, there was no contraction of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.948" offset="5079124">There was simply the payment of $25,000.00 to the person who by the clear and expressed provisions of the taxing statute is to be treated as the sole shareholder in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.231" offset="5148296">Thus, business purpose is we submit irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.954" offset="5175150">Moreover, though there clearly was a business purpose for issuing the preferred stock, there was no such purpose for its redemption as the taxpayer himself testified in his deposition on page 17 of the record, this was surplus money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.885" offset="5254875">The transaction was carried out for the benefit of the Mr. Davis and not of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.029" offset="5283506">The distribution of surplus money to the sole shareholder of a corporation is precisely the kind of distribution to which the dividend rules of Section 301 and 316 are designed to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.163" offset="5352051">Surely, that would be the result if no stock had been surrendered but Eisner and Macomber teaches that the presence or absence of pieces of paper representing the same proportion that enters in the corporation is irrelevant for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.820" offset="5422686">Here, the important fact is that under the provisions of the taxing statute, Mr. Davis owned all of the stock of the corporation before the transaction and he owned all of the stock of the corporation after the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.870" offset="5486843">The only substantial difference was that he had received $25,000.00 from the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.731" offset="6242304">The basic and underlying situation here is that Congress has provided that a person in Mr. Davis' situation is to be treated as the owner of all of the stock for the purpose of determining how he is to be taxed on the $25,000.00 which he undoubtedly received from the corporation which had earnings and profits and at least that amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="1585.181" offset="6444074">If he had simply owned stock at the beginning and had received $25,000.00, no one would question that the $25,000.00 was a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.430" offset="6481063">Now, the mere fact that he gave up a piece of paper not affecting his proportionate interest in the corporation, does not keep that from being essentially equivalent to a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.442" offset="6529128">As the owner of all of the stock is proportionate interest and the corporation did not change a particle as a result of the transaction, he owned it all before, he owned it all after, but when it was completed he had $25,000.00 in his own hands which he didn't have before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.301" offset="6604570">We say that that was a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.993" offset="6615333">As I have suggested in replying to Mr. Justice Black, if he in fact owned all of the stock himself, there could be no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.590" offset="6653680">I suggest that the $25,000.00 was taxable to him as a dividend since his proportionate interest was in no way changed and the presence or absence of pieces of paper in no way affected the substance of the transaction and the statute says that in his situation, he is to be taxed on the basis that all of the shares are attributed to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.365" offset="6760782">I've said that I think that Section 302 (b) (1) is the key here, of course, it's equally plain that Section 318 is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.989" offset="6803310">If the Court says as I think it should that Section 318 means what it says and that Congress intended it to mean what it says and intended not to have individual factual inquiries on a general equitable basis in the construction of 318, then I think that the consequence for which we are contending follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.220" offset="6888260">It may be somewhat literalistic but this is an area it seems to me where the tax statute can well be construed the way it is written in order to both to minimize repeated detailed factual inquiries into the circumstances of particular cases with no standard set up by Congress and in order to clarify the application of the tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.147" offset="7011976">It may or may not have been a wise provision for Congress to make, I think experience shows that it was necessary and useful, but it is the provision that Congress did make and it should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.203" offset="7068191">And accordingly I submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.175" offset="7292113">Now, true, he has given up only a piece of paper but he's got back exactly the amount of money that he put out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.739" offset="7370376">And I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General that Congress has power under the Sixteenth Amendment even if it wanted to, to say that that is taxable income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.410" offset="7665037">Mr. Davis was in the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.285" offset="7676531">The corporation who had this temporary capital which he had needed in order to get the RFC loan, when the RFC loan was paid off as had been intended all the time, the stock was redeemed, the corporation did not need the $25,000.00 as the Solicitor General states, it was surplus money, the preferred stock was 6% preferred stock, this was 1963 when preferred, when 6% was a good even money in any normal Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.558" offset="7809651">Having $25,000.00 that was not needed in the business, having 6% preferred stock outstanding would have redeemed the preferred stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.788" offset="7850506">It was for the benefit of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.600" offset="7861791">It may have been that Mr. Davis, he probably did wanted this $25,000.00 back since the purpose for which he had returned it into the corporation had been served but he is at the end of this two prong transaction exactly where he started, with his money back, that is a classic example of a return of capital and not of a dividend.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.703" offset="8370134">Now, there have been a number of cases where this very same thing happened in the lower courts and uniformly held for the taxpayer that where there was a temporary advance of equity capital to a corporation for a limited purpose and for a limited time with the understanding that it would be -- that the stock would be redeemed, when that purpose had been served, that that is a return of capital they have used therefore is business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.637" offset="8493955">Now, I think one Court did say and the Solicitor General has used the argument that while there's a business purpose in issuing the stock in the first place that the redemption of the stock is not a business purpose but I don't think you can view the entire transaction of this kind as in isolation, view the redemption in isolation probably original issuance of the stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.900" offset="8686947">The reason, the net effect test or the strict net effect test I think has come into play was largely because of the case that Mr. Griswold tried when he was in private practice, they bet for the state case in which this Court reversed the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.610" offset="8777853">Whereupon, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the bet for the state case had nothing to do with the stock redemption, it involved booth in a reorganization case and the Second Circuit had held that this booth was a return of capital and not a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.709" offset="8870222">This Court held that it was a dividend under the provision of the statute which used the words effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.716" offset="8898226">Whereupon, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals -- the Supreme Court has now reversed all of our earlier decisions in redemption cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.841" offset="8930722">So from now on, the Second Circuit has followed what they call as Strict Net Effect Test saying that the Bedford decision had overruled our prior decision when it didn't do any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.889" offset="8978892">And even as late as the Levin case last year, year before last, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals repeated this statement, that the Bedford case had overruled their prior decisions where they had followed the same or a different rule regarding redemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.863" offset="9050781">The Seventh Circuit in the (Inaudible) case which is cited in our brief pointed out very clearly that the two situations are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.360" offset="9096861">Now, the legislative history of this Section 302 (b) (1) states specifically as it could be stated that what Congress was intending to do in 302 (b) (1) was to revert in part to existing law under the Section 115 (g) of the old 1939 Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.052" offset="9211591">So, Congress said, the Senate Committee said that they were restoring that to the house bill which it left out the essentially equivalent test and they were restoring this essentially equivalent to a dividend test for the purpose of going back to existing law so that a taxpayer who could not come within one of these so called safe harbor provisions of the new code, the ones that we agree are not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.973" offset="9347218">They could not come within one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.765" offset="9354428">He could still rely on the fact that his redemption was not essentially equivalent to a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.416" offset="9392985">Nothing can be planned out it seems to me than the statement in the statement several times in the senate committee report that that was what was being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.695" offset="9442200">The original house bill had left out this essentially equivalent test and it only provided these mechanical tests based on ownership of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.792" offset="9486503">The questions -- the provisions being that if the shareholder's interest was terminated or if there were disproportionate redemptions, he could by following these technical rules escape dividend treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.645" offset="9554004">Now, those safe harbor provisions all referred to ownership of stock and the house bill had in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.879" offset="9590888">These attribution rules which that said should be followed in the determining the ownership of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.944" offset="9623176">Well, the Senate Committee kept that provision about determining the ownership of stock, the attribution rules for determining the ownership of stock but then puts back into the new 1954 code, the old 1939 provision about essentially equivalent to the dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.494" offset="9713351">We say that these attribution rules were not intended by Congress to apply to the essentially equivalent to a dividend test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.730" offset="9754311">They were intended to apply for the purposes of determining ownership in those provisions where ownership of stock was mentioned and there was no mention of ownership of stock in Section 302 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.614" offset="9817840">So, while the lower courts said no this Section is pretty wrong, they said for the purposes of this section, we'll say that the attribution rules apply but even though they do apply, this particular redemption is okay because of the business purpose rule and in one place, in one respect, I think I must agree whole heartedly with the Solicitor General and that is that these attribution rules either apply or they don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.733" offset="9954304">You can't say that they apply where a father and son love each other but they don't apply where they are estranged or where a man and his wife are estranged or where a partner and his partners, a partnership and partners are estranged, that would create interminable difficulty in finding out when the attribution rules do apply and when they don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.790" offset="10058480">But I say they don't apply at all with respect to Section 302 (b) (1) because that was the old test from the 1939 code where there were no attribution rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.489" offset="10113337">And in every statement in the Senate Committee report saying what they were trying to do, it was specifically stated that they were reverting to existing law with no qualification based on these attribution rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2536.876" offset="10250846">The Section 318 I think is ambiguous in this respect because it says that Section 318 (a) shall apply in determining the ownership of stock for purposes of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.141" offset="10327960">Now, I would have to agree that if we didn't have any legislative history and we didn't have any question of constitutional doubts raised that probably one would say it applied for the purposes of the old section including 302 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.140" offset="10395982">But if you look at the sequence of events by which this particular section got in to the 1954 code, I think it's perfectly plain that what Congress was saying was that these attribution rules should apply in determining the ownership of stock for the purposes of these provisions of the section where ownership of stock is mentioned, namely, Section 2 and Section 3 but not Section 1, I mean subsection 1 of Section 302.</text>
