            <label>Mr. Dennis G. Lyons</label>
            <text syncTime="11.244" offset="148355">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.895" offset="166954">Yesterday afternoon, we were to the point where we were discussing the -- what we take to be the principle contention of the respondents here and that is that the April 26, 1967 order of the Federal District Court and that was the order that denied the Atlantic Coast Line a preliminary injunction that that order was being protected or effectuated by the subsequent injunction, the 1969 injunction against enforcement of the May 1967 order of the state Court and that on that basis, they contend there is an exception here from Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.524" offset="377501">Our basic answer to that preposition is that the Federal District Court never purported to pass upon the availability of state rights or state remedies to the Atlantic Coast Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.313" offset="440613">His decree amounted to a denial of the injunction, which was sought solely under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.550" offset="465586">Their argument which was made for the first time two years later that the state injunction of May 1967 contravened the federal denial of an injunction is we submit simply a setting up of the federal law defense based on this Court’s subsequent decision in Jacksonville Terminal against the injunction in the state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.861" offset="570807">Now, there are number of subsidiary reasons why that April 26, 1967 order could not be the basis of the claimed exception here from Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.294" offset="624515">In the first place as we read the order, there is some dispute about it, but most of the cases that it cites are Norris-LaGuardia Act cases and that it appears to us to proceed primarily on the basis of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.831" offset="686686">We contend that the federal court order simply declined an injunction by reason of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and of course, the legislative history of that Act is clear that it leaves open the remedies under state law and in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.310" offset="748648">The respondents contend that the federal court order somehow constituted a comprehensive declaration of the party’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.044" offset="787519">And in effect, I suppose held that Coastline, the neutral road had no right to injunctive relief here on any basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.387" offset="828897">On its face, the order simply doesn’t say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.504" offset="845406">The most you could say, if the order were a declaration of rights and we read it that way if at all we'd be to this simply a denial on the basis of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, all it denied were rights under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.728" offset="894307">There is the further point that it is simply an order made upon application for at the most preliminary injunction, indeed it might have been an order simply denying a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.151" offset="939969">The record is a little unclear, but giving the respondents the benefit of the doubt it's an order the denying a preliminary injunction and the laws, we submit quite black letter on the point that you cannot have a determination of the party's substantive rights through a preceding on a preliminary injunction application.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.034" offset="1031502">We submit then that really what the respondents are trying to do here is to adjudicate this federal law defense, call it preemption or super session or maybe perhaps simply called the insertion of a federal law defense to the state court injunction by enjoining the proceedings in the state court and this we submit is at the core of what Section 2283 says that federal courts are not to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.574" offset="1313625">And he said that since the Court was of opinion that the defendants motion for preliminary injunction, that is their counter motion seeking to enjoin the state court proceedings has merit, our motion for voluntary dismissal will be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.256" offset="2832384">We have gone beyond the situation where the primary party, the FEC is involved in the joint use and control of a terminal facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.423" offset="2873031">What we have here is essentially hot car picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.353" offset="2896750">At first, it did not start out that way and there are still in this Court protestations that that is not what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.689" offset="2930082">But particularly in the last few days of the picketing here, what you had was an attempt and a successful attempt to induce the employees of the Coastline, operating within the Coastline's own yard, not to handle cars which had originated on the FEC, and not to handle inbound cars coming down from the north that were ultimately destined to the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.237" offset="3052335">Now, there is some talk by the respondents that this was done in a limited way that they only refused to handle long solid blocks of cars, that they only refused to make the very next move down to the point where the interchange would take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.054" offset="3123597">But the record is plain particularly in the last few days of the picketing that the refusals by the employees went well beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.257" offset="3160377">That they were beyond simply involving this last move down back from the interchange point.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.253" offset="3192351">That in one case they declined to move a road train that was destined up to go through way cross Georgia, which is fully made up simply because it had FEC cars in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.032" offset="3239476">And in the court below in the -- before the state court I should say, the counsel for the respondents took the view that this Court's opinion in Jacksonville Terminal was to the effect that it was no longer any question of how far you can go or how far you can't go, that there was no longer any body of law available to any employer doing business with the FEC, that would in any way restrict their right to picket his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.420" offset="3381060">Now, we contend that if you read the Jacksonville Terminal case that way, what you have is picketing which I think anybody would consider secondary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.787" offset="3430484">That's not a magic word, but it is a word that expresses sort of judgment about what it is when people who are essentially strangers to a labor dispute have their businesses interfered with by the parties to a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.184" offset="3512090">And it is a practice which the Congress has outlawed and outlawed in increasingly stringent terms for the last 23 years, starting at 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.290" offset="3560573">And which, the legislatures in virtually all the states and the state courts of common law have outlawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.726" offset="3598294">What the position of the respondents is as I understand is that despite that because of the fact that the Taft-Hartley Act is not as we concede not applicable here in the railroad industry that there is no agency of Government state or federal, judicial or administrative that can any way regulate or any way deal with these practices regardless of how far removed they are from directly operating upon the party that they have the dispute with.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.720" offset="3746252">In other words, the hot car approach, or the hot cargo approach, or the so-called hot property approach is outlawed in firstly every industry by the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act, but not in the railroad area and what is more to say the respondents that the states cannot do anything about it either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.346" offset="4584782">To the Section 2283, not at all, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.870" offset="4598888">We submit lastly that if the Jacksonville Terminal decision means what the respondents say that it means, it should be reconsidered by this Court, though, clearly we think the Court need not reach that point at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.639" offset="4653955">Our final contention takes us into an area which is relatively unchartered by this Court's decisions and that is that the Norris-LaGuardia Act here as well as Section 2283 precludes the injunction that the federal court granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.778" offset="4734516">The relationship between the non-struck carriers and the rail unions has been held by the lower courts and this Court in a four to four decision once upheld that as being a relationship arising out of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.650" offset="4805987">And hence, in the Jacksonville Terminal case by this Court and then this case, the Moncrief case by the lower court, the non struck carriers have been held not to be entitled to have a federal court injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.442" offset="4873174">We say that the Norris-LaGuardia Act works both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.699" offset="4890206">If the federal courts may not pass an injunction against the unions, we submit that in this situation, they may not pass an injunction against the non struck carriers restraining them from the use of the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.504" offset="4961364">It is clear on the face of the Norris-LaGuardia Act that it does work both ways, that it does inhibit injunctions against management just as it inhibits injunctions against unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.939" offset="5015176">And in fact, we quote in our brief considerable dialog in the floor of Senate and the House which indicate the Congress recognized that this was a two-edged sword when it was passed back in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.827" offset="5074631">Indeed, some of the practices that can't be enjoined are practices that only an employer could commit i.e joining an employer organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.498" offset="5121337">So, we submit that the very broad contention that the respondents make that the Act doesn't apply at all to injunctions against management is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.593" offset="5169716">We also say that Section 4 (d) of the statute makes it plain that injunctions against the ordinary course of judicial proceedings were one of the evils that Congress was trying to deal with when it passed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.117" offset="5235858">That being so, we are confronted with the very flat prohibition in Section 7, which flatly restrains the Courts of the United States from granting any injunction or labor dispute unless certain findings were made and those findings were not made here, including findings which certainly were very relevant to the subject matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.581" offset="5337736">Namely, there was no finding that the complainant has no adequate remedy at law, certainly his appellate rights in Florida state courts would have precluded the making of that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.463" offset="5381204">Indeed, there was no attempt to comply of Norris-LaGuardia Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.823" offset="5402624">So for this reason as well, we contend that the injunction here should not have been granted against the state court proceedings and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.407" offset="6501021">We think that with the two -- really, there is only one provision in the Norris-LaGuardia Act that applies to management and that is the one he sited about employer organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.505" offset="6565386">But, we think our basic position on that is that the tail will go with the hide, that once the 2283 problem is dealt with, the Norris-LaGuardia Act problem -- the Norris-LaGuardia Act just basically is not designed for this type of a problem and will develop that later, but our position is not that the Norris-LaGuardia Act can not apply to an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.913" offset="6703000">Now, the third position that we will develop is that this case is the strongest case for the application that is the should aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.207" offset="6760155">We will demonstrate that there is the power of the District Court to do this, but this is the strongest case for the application of an injunction against a state court that has ever come before this Court or a lower court in a reported opinion and it is a stronger case for the granting of such injunction than any reported case granting one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.624" offset="6877915">In connection with the totality of regulation of -- by the federal court, there are four separate cases, cases that is with separate file numbers, that the jurisdiction of which, is aided by this injunction and orders are need to protection of this injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.124" offset="7003826">Now, the types of matters which have been before the court below are absolutely legend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.731" offset="7058265">This Court recalls the clerk's case that was before this Court, that was a case brought by the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.332" offset="7104658">It is a case in which it was determined that the Florida East Coast railroad for the first two years of its operations, its post strike operation was operating in violation of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.164" offset="7176025">There was an order entered in that case requiring good faith bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.682" offset="7198072">There was an order in that case granting to the railroad certain limited exceptions or deviations from its collective bargaining contracts in aid of its self-help rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.146" offset="7259930">That case still pends that there is a trial commencing our final, another final hearing in that case commencing the first week of April to go on for all of April and all of May and the issues are again, the good faith bargaining that is all in contempt citations, the good faith bargaining, massive violations of the injunction since the strike, and on other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.106" offset="7391796">All of that still pends and the good faith order, the good faith order depends on economic sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.475" offset="7445295">As Justice -- Mr. Justice Brennan has written in the Insurance Agents case, and has written in other cases too, and it is in the Galveston Wharves case the decision of the Fifth Circuit in the same area of 2282, that bargaining, the motive power in bargaining is economic sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.989" offset="7555323">Now in this case, that is the Florida East Coast strike, there are as there are in all railroad or other situations two types of economic sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.630" offset="7613942">One is the withdrawal of your people at the commencement of the strike and the second type is picketing aimed at those persons, the employees or persons making pick ups and deliveries to the struck employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.382" offset="7716864">Its -- in other industries, it's more general than that, but in the railroad industry, the place where you put the pressure on is where the railroad gets its freight from another railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.482" offset="7785305">Now, from the commencement of this strike up until the present, there has not with the exception of a few hours in 1966 and a few hours in 1967 any use of the economic sanction to stop pick ups and deliveries from other railroads by asking the employees of other railroads not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.367" offset="7900871">That has been prevented by an injunction initially issued by the United States District Court for the middle district to Florida and that is another case in which in that case still pends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.258" offset="7972446">Now Mr. Lyons in his brief has talked about that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.957" offset="7991150">That's a case in which the United States District Court has assumed jurisdiction over interchange and the organizations, labor organizations were never allowed to get into that case, and as they say, it mandates interchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.190" offset="8076100">Now, what is happened since that time is, there was a lawsuit filled in 1965 by the organizations to construe that injunction as not to apply to employees who had -- of the connecting carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.598" offset="8165752">Then in 1966, the Trainmen strike against -- the Trainmen picketing of the terminal area began and effectively, there was a construction of that assumed jurisdiction over interchange to initially not permit picketing of the terminal company and ultimately to permit picketing of the terminal company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.279" offset="8308485">And then in 1967, in this case with the different file number nonetheless, the Court has again, but with a different file number assumed jurisdiction to determine whether or not we and I say in this case we, it is the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, can picket the Moncrief Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.206" offset="8428231">All of these cases are all interrelated and they all have impact back and forth on each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.598" offset="10669746">Even if it wasn't, he certainly had assumed jurisdiction to determine the legality of this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.026" offset="10707466">So, he certainly has the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.717" offset="10726275">Now, we've heard over here that everything was done, everything was done in this litigation to entitle them to a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.224" offset="10784266">I forget the exact terms, but you recall what Mr. Lyons says, talked about it and says Mr. Friedman that after this injunction against the state court proceeding was entered that they asked Judge Scott, the other district judge, to either set it aside or to give them a final judgment because everything that had been done, all the facts were in and all he had to do is just enter a file of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.946" offset="10907146">I mean that's true, I mean, that's where the case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.475" offset="10917282">It is a question of either our conduct is legal or illegal, Judge McCray says his ruled that its legal conduct and when he made that ruling back in 1967 and this is along the line that there is a judgment to protect or effectuate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.284" offset="11012472">He -- this Court had not yet ruled in Jacksonville Terminal, but you will see in his opinion or order that he cites Section 20 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.578" offset="11077674">Now, this Court has heard about Section 20 of the Clayton Act from us since 1966 that Section 20 of the Clayton Act as discussed by the Hutcheson case in Norris-LaGuardia breathing life back in the Clayton, it's been our position on legality from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.262" offset="11188433">And that's what Judge McCray said in his order in 1967 and that was before the order of this Court to be sure, but that is what his determination was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.407" offset="11240991">He determined that Norris-LaGuardia applied, but he went much further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.057" offset="11287594">He also in terms of this order being an order which is necessary to protect or effectuate, he cites -- defines that we were engaged in a major dispute and he cites the B&amp;O case, which is a standard fairly recent then, casing that once you had exhausted the procedures of the Railway Labor Act, once there was a major dispute, then you are entitled to self help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.139" offset="11423953">You had a legal right to self help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.630" offset="11437850">Now, the content of self help is something else, but it's -- we -- it is certainly been said often enough by this Court that -- that self help implies as it does -- as it must, since there is the duty to bargain in the Act, it must imply primary strikes and primary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.041" offset="11551535">Now, he cited the B&amp;O case, this is a major dispute, he talks about what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.070" offset="11591659">Now, I haven't got into the facts and I may never have a chance to get very far into the facts, but we've heard over and over again and this Court has heard over and over again, this great tale of horror.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.402" offset="11765008">In this case, they run into the Atlantic Coastline property where they complete their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.570" offset="11797608">They make a delivery and they make pick ups in the employees of the neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.663" offset="11826030">The Atlantic Coastline, are people that under any idea of primary picketing, we are entitled to ask, “Don't pick up and do not make deliveries to the primary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.311" offset="11880573">Now, this happens to be a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.629" offset="11889873">This Moncrief Yard picketing in which every effort was made to limit the manner of picketing so that it would have the effect only on pick ups and deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.775" offset="11954448">Now, we didn't even use a picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.349" offset="11964792">If we put a picket line up at the one and only entrance, the only place that employees of Atlantic Coastline go to work in the Moncrief Yard is at this one employee entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.970" offset="12031248">If we put a picket line there, those employees whose duty it is to make pick ups and deliveries to the FEC within that yard, where the FEC engines come, no other place to reach those people, if we will put a picket line there, that closes the yard down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.080" offset="12111705">Now, there is this assertion over here made that that's really what we had in mind doing that we just want to close the yard down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.596" offset="12165726">And what we did, I might say was we let the people go to work, we just asked them simple thing, “Don't handle the interchange” and that is what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.327" offset="12204701">Now, that relates back because that's what Judge McCray found in his order, now, I'll show you that in just a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.976" offset="13355238">It's very similar to Capital Service because the difference there, the Board invoked the jurisdiction as only the board can under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.978" offset="13403303">Here, it is private parties who may invoke the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.831" offset="13430680">But the Looney case is case that goes back quite a number of years, but the Looney case is a case in which this Court approved an injunction against the state court case -- state court injunction in a Texas rate dispute that is the way I think of it in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.936" offset="13527124">And that case, the Looney case is discussed, it is quite significant because it is like Capital Service in that an injunction was issued, it was in aid of jurisdiction but of the Court rather than to protect or effectuate a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.009" offset="13611447">But the Looney case is of particular significance because it is discussed at length in the Toucey decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.973" offset="13663274">The Justice Frankfurter opinion for the Court, and Justice Reed's opinion for the minority, and in both the majority and the minority, the same conclusion is reached about Looney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.550" offset="13789602">Justice Frankfurter in that case said that, that case was granted merely to protect its jurisdiction until the suit brought by the carriers was finally settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.907" offset="13834951">Now the significance of that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.036" offset="13855535">2283, Mr. Lyons has suggested to us that 2283 has a lot of pigeon holes and this does not fit a pigeon hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.824" offset="13902660">The pigeon hole for a race, there is a pigeon whole for a removed case, there is a pigeon hole for fully adjudicated case and that is all he said, the pigeon holes were in his main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.136" offset="13955950">Now, a lot of cases don't happen to fit in those pigeon holes, but 2283 isn't a pigeon whole statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.637" offset="13989909">The history of 2283 is that, it initially was a flat blanket statement by the Congress, “the District Court shall not enjoin state courts” and then eventually the bankruptcy addition came into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.652" offset="14057932">And then finally in 1948, it was changed because of Toucey, but what had this court done in the mean time?</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.300" offset="14120521">This Court had said that obviously, there are situations in which it is necessary that having jurisdiction, a District Court has got general equity jurisdiction in it has got to be able to protect that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.118" offset="14195858">And so, various cases came along and Looney was one of them that where it was necessary to protect the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.751" offset="14250402">Now, Justice Frankfurter in 1941 in the Toucey case said that, the policy against enjoining state courts was so great that even a fully litigated case that was a money judgment diversity case, but the policy of the United States against enjoining state courts was great enough to require somebody who would fully litigated the matter in the federal courts to go ahead and just plead res judicata and go on all the way up again through the state system and back around.</text>

            <text syncTime="3850.775" offset="15506474">Well, he did rule the question of the legality, the issue of legality of our conduct was submitted to Judge McCray in 1967, about that, there can be no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.493" offset="15589334">Now, there was a question up until this past year as to whether or not there might be some independent state remedy as it was thought that could intrude into railway labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.096" offset="15687764">Now as long as that was the case, and there the suggestion is made, well, if it required protection -- If it is what you say it is, why didn't you go in 1967?</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.962" offset="15751189">Well, you're into the area then of the question of really a should preposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.567" offset="15785671">Until this Court has ruled and incidentally the arrangement was with counsel that we would let the 1967 picketing cases lie until this Court had ruled and when this Court had ruled within about two weeks we were in before Judge Locke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.745" offset="15886399">So, why the reason for not going in, in 1967 is that a Federal District Court with that question remaining as an open question would be reluctant to enjoin not because it couldn't, not because it didn't interfere but because that just would not -- you never get somebody to do it is really what's involved, but once its clear that that interferes it's not a question of trying a res judicata defense, it's not a question of under the statute, it is not question of any of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.634" offset="16069883">It's simply a question that the state court action fetters the federal court in making its determination or it is contrary or in some -- it does not really even need to be contrary as long as it's necessary to some reason or to be necessary for the court to take action and here, that is really very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.222" offset="16204257">Now, it is said by Mr. Lyons that Richman Brothers ends the matter and that Richman Brothers says that there is a forbidden fruit here that you can't try a preemption court -- a defense in the Federal District Court, that you got to let that go on up.</text>

            <text syncTime="4110.000" offset="16543326">But fundamentally, it all does come back down to the question of there was no jurisdiction to aid or a judgment or order to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.925" offset="16595048">Now, Professor Moore has something to say about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.809" offset="16638621">Professor Moore says the -- and this is on page 43 of our brief, “The second exception permits a federal court to grant an injunction against state proceedings where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.997" offset="16695359">This puts back into 2283 some of the judicial flexibility which Toucey had removed from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.188" offset="16732139">And despite the strict reading of 2283 by Richman Brothers, flexibility still remains for Richmond as we shall see held only that the District Court had no jurisdiction to aid. But if on the other hand a federal court has jurisdiction, then under the terms of 2283, it may enjoin state court proceedings where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.420" offset="16849063">Now, since that time there has been the Galveston Wharves decision of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.051" offset="16915623">It's possible that it is very round decision is since that time as well which -- but perhaps not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.513" offset="16949373">The Galveston Wharves decision was a case like the FEC in this regard that it had been to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.580" offset="17013739">It is -- it was a case that had spawned considerable litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.856" offset="17054804">The state court had enjoined picketing, the federal court had mandated that the carrier engage in good faith bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.135" offset="17103914">The federal court enjoined the state court from enjoining the picketing because of the impact that that would have regardless of considerations of secondary conduct and Galveston again was a decision before this Court's decision in Jacksonville Terminal and that case is essentially in terms of the power under 2283, essentially the same case as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.086" offset="17243721">The Sperry Rand case is a Court of Appeals case in that case an injunction was issued against the state court to protect a discovery order of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.734" offset="17322297">In the Brown versus Pacific Mutual case, which is a case which goes back prior to the 1948 Amendments, Justice Parker issued an injunction against a state court or rather he affirmed an injunction against a state court in a case which only involved cancellation of an insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.812" offset="17434624">The suit in the federal court was for cancellation, the suit in the state court was on a $450.00 claim arising under the policy and he discusses at great length and this is back when there were no exceptions to 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.511" offset="17517380">He discusses the Kline case which is a case Kline, and Toucey, and Richmond are really the cases most often talked about, but when you come through all of it and that injunction was sustained, but it never reached this Court, but when you come down really to all of it, certainly the Looney case is still the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.769" offset="17658441">The Looney case does not fit into any body's pigeon hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.776" offset="17686444">The Looney case is simply a case in aid of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.893" offset="17714970">This is what the respondents say about Looney and the Sperry Rand case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.149" offset="17755930">What they teach is that an interlocutory order of a federal court is as much entitle to protection by injunction against interference from a state court as a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.803" offset="17810578">That's certainly true under Looney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.830" offset="17830640">Looney -- the principles of Looney were certainly carried forward and probably broadened in the, but at least carried forward in the 48 revision, and that is certainly within the language of 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.856" offset="17906813">Now, the reason that this case is the strongest case that of any case for the application of 2283 is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.283" offset="17980479">There are at least 0 or 40 separate cases the District Court has had, innumerable cases involving this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.655" offset="18026036">The Fifth Circuit has had opinions that, I don't think you can number on two hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.579" offset="18065638">All of these matters ultimately come down to one thing that the Florida East Coast strike will be settled only if there is bargaining, when you finally come down to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.640" offset="18129899">Now, there has been no economic power, no economic sanction that could be put to bear upon the Florida East Coast Railroad since the first two years of the strike, except the economic sanction of asking the employees of the neutral railroads not deliver cars to the FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.012" offset="18247450">Now in a situation like this and what, the reason really I think that the economic sanctions initially didn't bring any kind of settlement, was because the FEC immediately started all these illegal operations for which there is a proceedings now about restoration of the status quo and so forth, but they effectively through illegal conduct wanted that, that is not the fault of the Atlantic Coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.489" offset="18373360">But also from the very beginning, the other form of primary activity and surely there must some way in the railroad industry that you are entitled to ask the people who make pick ups and deliveries in the terms of the Steelworker case or in the terms of this Court last year not to do that and of course, one knows that in this industry that they won't do it if you ask them not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.840" offset="18486732">So, there is an economic power that has never been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.898" offset="18498957">That is what is involved in this case and this Court has decided that state courts have no business in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.572" offset="18545664">That interferes with not only the federal scheme, but that interferes and with jurisdiction assumed over the bargaining, over the self help rights of the railroad and over the question not only of interchange between the carriers, but interchange as it affects the rights of this people and it is all one ball of wax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.036" offset="18647542">But if for instance, let us assumed that a state court tells the federal court that the railroad cannot deviate one iota from its contract and we know that Judge Simpson who is originally the District Judge following the mandate of this Court, allowed the railroad to get away in its operations from certain matters, I forget exactly what they were to long, but some matters of its collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.994" offset="18783378">Now, there wouldn't be any hesitation, I dare say, that that injunction by a state court would come within 2283 and be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.998" offset="18823398">And this is simply the other side of the coin and the only reason it looks any different in perspective is because the order says, “Okay, do it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4742.194" offset="19072188">I mean, the basic dispute still pends it's over 10 cents an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.065" offset="19095594">A demand made in 1961 and for 10 cents an hour the hold up strike can be settled for 10 cents an hours in an economy that from 1961 to 1969 has expanded 25 -- on inflation 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.104" offset="19163826">I mean, so something is wrong in this strike and it is that this traditional weapon of labor, primary picketing against people who make deliveries and pick ups has never been able to be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="4883.755" offset="19638418">The difference would be in Capital Service, it is the Board that invokes the jurisdiction of the court and then in the Capital Service, the Court unfettered itself first.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.501" offset="19701426">Under the Railway Labor Act, it is private litigants who invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to make a determination under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.997" offset="19759313">And if Capital Service is analogized to the Railway Labor Act, then an initial proceeding brought by a private litigant to have the federal court determine a question of Railway Labor Act law would be entitled, once the Court had assumed jurisdiction to do that would be within 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.999" offset="19879372">Now, that doesn't make a stronger case for the “should aspect” as we have in this case because of the totality of all of the different factors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis G. Lyons</label>
            <text syncTime="5128.431" offset="20617070">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.529" offset="20629504">Mr. Milledge referred to a number of other proceedings besides the case at Bar which presumably the District Court was protecting orders in -- by enjoining the state court proceedings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.034" offset="20699512">Now, the District Court itself never cited any of these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.115" offset="20723858">I don't believe they were cited to it by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.139" offset="20735979">They were mentioned for the first time in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.422" offset="20753011">There are three proceedings essentially, one of them is the so called the Clerks case to which the neutral carriers are not even a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.152" offset="20788015">The other is a proceeding in which there's never been any order entered of any affirmative or even negative sort it and the only other one is this 1963 case and the only order that has ever been entered in that and we discuss all of these in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.451" offset="20857187">The only order that has ever been entered in that is an order that the FEC got against the Atlantic Coastline and the other neutral carriers requiring them to interchange and we scarcely see how the state court order in any way contravenes that order since the picketing that the state court sought to enjoin was designed to disrupt the interchange by getting the Coastline stop the interchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.854" offset="20982784">This case is quite different than from the Looney case which was mentioned frequently by counsel in his oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.073" offset="21015698">In Looney, there was an affirmative interlocutory injunction granted by the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.424" offset="21049031">Then a state court ordered the taking of certain action which was inconsistent, completely inconsistent with the federal court injunction and it was held that the federal court could enjoin proceedings upon that state court injunction notwithstanding that the federal court injunction was interlocutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.333" offset="21144743">This is an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.051" offset="21155610">There is no order whatsoever that the injunction under review protects or effectuates the assertions of the federal court's jurisdiction in this case, have been solely assertions as to the federal law rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.305" offset="21236590">There is no diversity, the state law claims were never pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.950" offset="21255189">We get down to the final point in this case that what the respondents are trying to do here is to adjudicate this defense based on their reading of the Jacksonville Terminal case by way of brining an injunction against the state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.363" offset="21344841">Now, they have stated that the argument we're making is essentially a pigeon whole argument that they have to point to a specific exception to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.891" offset="21398967">Well that is the way the statute reads, pigeon whole is a kind of a tendentious way of saying it but it's a general statute with specific exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.513" offset="21437419">As the Court said in Richman Brothers, legislative policy is here expressed in Section 2283, in a clear cut prohibition qualified only by specifically defined exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.552" offset="21497605">The exception I think that the respondents are trying to urge on this Court is the exception that we heard much of the very end of Mr. Milledge's argument and that is that they just can't wait for the orderly adjudication of their federal defenses in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.207" offset="21592168">They have not joined with us in entering a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.176" offset="21608051">They admit that they could have had one entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.331" offset="21620694">They have left that situation stand now for nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.877" offset="21642846">They have not lifted a finger to take an appeal in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.590" offset="21665729">The preposition we submit that the respondents are urging upon this Court cuts at the very heart of what Congress tried to do back in 1793 and ever since when it is enacted and reenacted this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="5411.282" offset="21748485">Mr. Lyons, let me ask you, if this -- if in 1967, the federal court had said expressly or in effect that this issue before me is governed exclusively by federal law and if the railroad has no right to an injunction under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.033" offset="21839496">Now and then, the railroad promptly resorted to state courts and asked the state court to adjudicate the controversy under state law and asked for an injunction under the state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5467.865" offset="21974810">You could make the argument that what we were trying to do then was to re-litigate that order and that we should have appealed that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.016" offset="22011486">Now, we didn't appeal his order and if it said something else from what it had said, presumably our decision as to appeal would have been quite different.</text>
