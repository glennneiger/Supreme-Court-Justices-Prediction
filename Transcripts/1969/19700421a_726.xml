            <text syncTime="78.013" offset="415431">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.746" offset="430373">The appellants in this case are the Communist Party of the United States of America, Communist Party of the State of Minnesota, Mrs. Charlene Mitchell and Mr. Michael Zagerell, 1968 Communist Party Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, Mrs. Betty Smith State Secretary of the Minnesota Communist Party, 10 presidential electors from the State of Minnesota for the Communist Party, two plaintiff appellees representing the 2,394 registered voters who signed a petition to put the Communist Party candidates on the 1968 ballot and one registered voter who did not sign the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.149" offset="636008">The Communist Party of the State of Minnesota as well as the National Party are unincorporated associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.604" offset="665788">The Communist Party of Minnesota held a duly convened statewide convention in Minnesota on or about June 23, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.909" offset="711032">They elected six delegates and an alternate delegate to the National Convention of the Communist Party U.S.A, which was called for and held in New York, July 4 to July 7, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.690" offset="778115">At the Communist Party of Minnesota Convention, a motion was passed that if the Communist Party U.S.A nominated a presidential ticket that the Communist Party of Minnesota would endeavor to place on the ballot in Minnesota those candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.128" offset="847914">Mrs. Betty Smith attended that convention as a delegate in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.354" offset="868812">Mrs. Mitchell and Mr. Zagerell were duly nominated by that convention immediately following the Communist Party of Minnesota mounted a campaign to obtain the requisite number of signatures, under Minnesota Law, 2000 to place the candidates on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.680" offset="978108">On this nominating petition appeared the name of the ten Communist presidential electors and under Minnesota Law on the ballot only appears the name of the candidates and by Minnesota Law, a vote for the candidates is a vote for those electors.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.704" offset="1078209">On Sunday, September 8, the party completed its campaign to collect signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.896" offset="1106944">On the next day, Monday the 9th, representatives of the Communist Party, the National Office as well as the State appeared at the Office of Secretary of State of Minnesota Joseph Donovan to file the nominating petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.026" offset="1163473">The party representatives arrived at the Secretary of State's Office during the noon hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.437" offset="1193148">Immediately after noon, they tendered their petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.221" offset="1208299">This petition was anticipated and they were presented a written refusal of the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.715" offset="1246229">He did examine the contents of the package and satisfied himself that it was the nominating petition for the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.962" offset="1287189">His refusal said, “Please be advised that upon the advice of the Attorney General of Minnesota and at his direction as a matter of law, I hereby officially refuse.”</text>
            <text syncTime="307.181" offset="1332120">The Attorney General had issued an opinion which was also a copy of which was given to the representatives, in which the Attorney General said, “In view of the Federal Statutes and quoted in full Sections 841 and 842 of the Communist Control Act, we are of the opinion that you should refuse to accept for filing the nominating petition in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.736" offset="1430340">However, any doubts relative to this matter can only be finally resolved by the Courts pursuant to appropriate legal proceedings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="343.374" offset="1476838">The party went to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.487" offset="1485302">Judge Devitt convened the three-fudge District Court and on September 30th, heard arguments of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.809" offset="1522604">Following that and inspite of a request for a permanent injunction, the Court ruled that a hurried decision would not be appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.532" offset="3089533">We have statewide elections, we have elections for United States Senator as well as for the House of Representatives and if this case is -- if the order of the court below is upheld as moot, the Communist Party will have participated in litigation for almost two years and be in precisely the situation that we argue such an order would place us that is that we would have to go back into Court again and litigate the question of the right of the party to appear on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.036" offset="3231535">The court below refused to reach the merits saying that a hurried decision would not be wise or would be unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.501" offset="3265390">They also wish the United States to be a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.463" offset="3285243">Chief Judge Devitt teletyped the United States Attorney, Mr. Ramsey Clark and ordered him to appear on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.791" offset="3322546">Mr. Clark replied with a letter saying that he had other commitments and did not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.369" offset="3344802">However, he sent the United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota to appear amicus curiae and he did appear and argued to the Court that the Communist Control Act does not bar the party from the ballot that it can be interpreted citing Catherwood as for the proposition that Communist Party, pardon me, candidates could run as long as they didn't use the label Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.691" offset="3466115">He also suggested to the Attorney General that Minnesota Law might allow the Communist Party to appear on the ballot with the designation Communist Party, an argument which was not accepted by either the Court or by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.047" offset="3531525">I think that that position of the United States fails because it does not recognize that the party itself under Minnesota Law has a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.313" offset="3584606">There are provisions in the law, which allow a party to present candidates if it receives a percentage of votes and we feel that a vote for party enthronement is equally as important as a vote for party candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.654" offset="3662033">The United States in its brief relied on Salwen and Rees.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.298" offset="3680528">The only other case construing the Communist Control Act in terms of elections for the proposition that a Communist Party candidate could run for election.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.379" offset="3720861">In that case the New Jersey Courts as well including the Supreme Court did not accept even that argument and said that it would be a keen way to avoid the effect of the Act if Communist Party Candidates could run and hide from the public or not mention the fact that they are espousing Communist Party principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.854" offset="3806751">So, both the appellants and the appellees in this case agree that there is no question that the Communist Party -- I'm sorry that the Communist Control Act bars the Communist Party or its candidate from running in elections whether or not they disclose or speak to the effect that they are running under the Communist Party label.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.462" offset="5929253">In 1948, when Congress was considering and the year subsequent a number of bills which would have barred the Communist Party from activity, two congressional subcommittees were holding hearings on legislation aimed at restricting the activities of the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.012" offset="6123395">The opinion was forthcoming in a letter on March 9, 1948 to the Chairman of the House Committee on House Administration that letter said and I quote, “Although this department is in complete sympathy of course with the desire that no subversive or disloyal person should be permitted to hold a position of honor, trust, or profit in the Government, it is believed that the bill under consideration will be of doubtful validity and enforceability for many reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.508" offset="6249409">The most outstanding of which is that it might be regarded as in the nature of Bill of Attainder, a denial of due process of law and an attempt by the Federal Government to legislate insofar as it would apply to the qualifications of a political party in any election in a field for which no federal authority exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.258" offset="6888364">On the first paragraph of page 45, the second sentence says, “both the attorney general and the U.S. Attorney argued below that the Communist Control Act infringes upon the power of the states in this regard that is to qualify electors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.543" offset="6961507">The inclusion of the Minnesota Attorney General should not be there, this was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.483" offset="7001318">Turning to the merits, we urge the Court to find the Act unconstitutional as a Bill of Attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.090" offset="7031724">We believe the Act is a classical Bill of Attainder and the decisions of this Court and all who sat on this Court considering the cases of attainder would find this Act a classical Bill of Attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.330" offset="7096717">First, the Act outlaws the Communist Party by legislative fiat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.609" offset="7117824">The party itself was outlawed in this case in the SACB Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.225" offset="7136319">I'm sorry, this Court in that case pointed out that if the party by name were outlawed, the Act would be a Bill of Attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.855" offset="7166830">The Communist Control Act of 1954 made this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.783" offset="7202461">The second test is whether there is a legislative finding of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.954" offset="7227225">In 841 there is the flat conclusion that the Communist Party should be outlawed and in 841 also, in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.005" offset="7283440">There is a legislative finding of guilt taking away from the power of the Court to make determination not granting a hearing to the party on its conclusions and we urge that the position of the appellees that this Court may take into consideration the legislative findings in other and not related acts as to the nature of a Communist Party cannot support this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.579" offset="7385736">We feel that's a novel assertion that the findings of one Act can be held to support another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.500" offset="7413321">This Act was adopted on the eve of adjournment in 1954, there were no committee hearings on the Act saved Congressman Dice, the legislative history has been properly described by this Court in the Catherwood case has given little guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.601" offset="7513736">The third test, we feel, is met as if the party is punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.255" offset="7536410">There is no comparable example of such a flat legislative finding of guilt in the absence of a judicial trial and the cases of this Court going back to the post Civil War Bill of Attainder cases Cummings and Garland clearly show that punishment need not be imprisonment but in fact point out specific -- in specific example precisely what has happened under this Act that the party is barred from the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.755" offset="7646438">The fourth test and one which this Court which many authorities feel this Court has set forth in Dallas is also met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.050" offset="7683532">There is no opportunity for the party to reform itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.195" offset="7696175">It cannot escape the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.258" offset="7708400">Nothing it does can allow it to come to the ballot and in fact, the interpretations of the Act do not allow an individual candidate supporting the principles of the party to appear without party endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.181" offset="7780080">The second provision and there are many or the second of unconstitutionality and one which we feel is in equal weight is the infringement upon freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.974" offset="7827310">This Court in the last term in Williams and Rhodes made it clear with the right vote and First Amendment protects that right both for the right of qualified voters to cast their votes as well as the right of individuals to associate with a party or an association to cast their votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.647" offset="7901915">The state would urge that the paltry showing of the party in the last election, 415 votes, would minimize the importance of participation in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.747" offset="7954369">We feel that cannot be serious in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.172" offset="7968057">The real importance and contribution to participation in the political process is the forum of an electoral contest as freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.781" offset="8010480">This Court has made it clear that freedom of speech is on the highest of scale of constitutional liberties and we feel the Court has also made it clear that the right to vote is at the top with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4169.569" offset="16781667">It was the situation in Zwickler and Koota and in that case the fact that it was moot is a separate issue from whether there is jurisdiction to appeal from the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.823" offset="16826702">In Zwickler, the need for injunctive relief had passed and the Court, this Court accepted jurisdiction on the remaining declaratory relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4394.400" offset="17681011">A question was raised as to whether it would be required by us to have a future -- a class action alleging future elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="4417.597" offset="17773798">The Communist Party itself, the political party, is an appellant in this case and the party has maintained that it will run for future elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="4451.013" offset="17907440">One last point, we feel that the question of granting of declaratory relief after the need for an injunction is passed is founded in the number of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.676" offset="17966059">United States v. 149 Gift Packages, the Court considered a case of libel against Gift Packages by the Government alleging them to be misbranded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.140" offset="18007960">The answer did not deny misbranding but filed a counterclaim which attacked the statute as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.952" offset="18031156">In that case, as well as a number of other cited in the appellant's brief, declaratory relief was granted after the necessity for injunctive relief had passed and the three-judge court jurisdiction was sustained.</text>
