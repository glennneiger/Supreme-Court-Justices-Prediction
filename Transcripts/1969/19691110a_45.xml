            <label>Mr. Alan W. Borst</label>
            <text syncTime="58.458" offset="337168">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.354" offset="344795">If the court pleases, this is a civil action, a case in patent infringement which was tried in the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.033" offset="391502">The trial was had and a opinion was rendered in written form declined that the patent in suit namely Neville Patent, number 3,005,280 was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.416" offset="457017">Not reaching the issue of infringement on account of that adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.604" offset="489827">The appeal was then made to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit here in Richmond, before which we had oral argument and after that, decision was rendered reversing the District Court, remanding it to the District Court for consideration of the infringement issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.425" offset="569031">Stay of that mandate was then granted on petitioner's request pending of course the termination of that whole matter by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.320" offset="616678">The Neville patent in suit, basically, discloses a street paver and suspended from the street paver is a heat generator.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.479" offset="689298">The street paver basically comprises a hopper which receives bituminous materials from a truck which has obtained the materials from an asphalt plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.028" offset="747499">A distributor which deposits the material on a roadbed and a tamper which in vibrating fashion compacts the material on the road -- on the bed and very often a screed which irons or planes the material so as to smooth it and should finally shape the pavement.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.517" offset="849481">The heater which is suspended from the paver in the Neville case, in the Neville Patent is not used in the operation of the paver to form the pavement -- the first strip of pavement.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.370" offset="916877">It is used solely when paving the second strip which is to be laid in abutting relation to the first strip.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.856" offset="966823">The heater functions to preheat the longitudinal, marginal edge of the first strip -- had been laid and which had allowed to grow cool and then the paver itself deposits the asphalt on the roadbed and against the new -- the preheated edge so as to form a bond therewith, a union therewith and to make the so-called cold joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.774" offset="1126484">The claims in suit, and we have considered claimed for as representative call broadly for means for laying the asphalt and means for shaping the pavement.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.032" offset="1187506">And broadly, therefore, covers the paver itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.321" offset="1208613">The claim goes on to recite a radiant energy generating means and further in connection with the radiant energy generating means that it comprises a combustion chamber.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.394" offset="1272978">The lower plate of which is perforated.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.225" offset="1288234">And through the holes of the perforation or adjacent thereto propane gases or butane gases are fired and the plate thereby becomes incandescently hot and becomes a source of radiant energy or infrared heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.389" offset="1368900">The radiant energy generator in the Neville patent is disclosed as far it is claimed in the Schwank Patent number 2,775,294 and the Neville specification so states that the radiant energy generator that is disclosed in the Schwank Patent is entirely suitable for the patentee's purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.497" offset="1489377">The components of the paver and the components of the generator are all old elements which are readily conceded by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.873" offset="1574849">In reversing the District Court --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="371.197" offset="1588120">There's is no process patent involved here though, is it, just two products?</text>

          <turn speaker="alan_w_borst" startTime="372.923" stopTime="518.072">
            <label>Mr. Alan W. Borst</label>
            <text syncTime="372.923" offset="1595016">There is no process claims, just apparatus claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.235" offset="1616332">In reversing the District Court the Circuit Court of Appeals commented that the steps which occupy the attention of the District Court were narrow ones and went on to decide to make its decision largely based on the satisfaction of the long felt need and eventual acceptance -- the eventual acceptance of Neville's concepts by respondents experts who were initially skeptical.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.851" offset="1750810">The court then went on to find that the method of forming the so-called cold joint between two asphalt lanes of concrete highway previous to Neville involve the process of cutting back the vertical marginal edge and painting it with asphalt.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.770" offset="1870451">We feel that both this finding of the of the Circuit Court of Appeals and the significance to be attached to the expert's original sceptability, and incredulity must be weighed in terms of the prior art which was extent at that time, included in that art was British patent number 756,911.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.046" offset="1983509">According to that patent, it was entirely feasible to cut back -- to heat the vertical edge of the first laid lane of concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.544" offset="2049546">There is no mention in this prior art patent of cutting back that edge and painting it with hot asphalt.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.674" offset="2094059">We feel that knowledge of this patent as well as other patents of the prior art as we feel are particularly opposite and their disclosures should be imputed constructively to the respondents experts as well as to the patentee himself.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="518.072" offset="2175666">How much of the prior art upon which you now rely was available in the patent office, all of it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_w_borst" startTime="525.219" stopTime="748.905">
            <label>Mr. Alan W. Borst</label>
            <text syncTime="525.219" offset="2204296">All of it but the so-called Morcom patent which I am about to come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.006" offset="2243375">The British patent was cited during the prosecution of the Neville application.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.785" offset="2278484">This knowledge should be of the previous method of forming the edge should be -- we feel should be imputed as to the patentee himself who is supposed to have filled a long felt need and thereby had made an un-obvious discovery as required for patentability under 35 U.S. Code 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.122" offset="2395826">Aside from this -- petitioner believes it would be made to consider here this question of long felt need or commercial success and its function in Patent Law with regard to the determination of the validity or invalidity of patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.686" offset="2474088">Under the decisions, there is no question but that this is a marginal or peripheral question.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.271" offset="2508466">This conclusion was explicitly expounded by this court in the A&amp;P. versus Supermarket Case decided in 1950 in which it said and I quote, “Commercial success without invention will not make patentability.”</text>
            <text syncTime="617.111" offset="2571786">The decisions over the years have said that commercial success may be used to resolve doubt as to invention but not to inject such doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.956" offset="2615150">So therefore, recognizing that such a ground is long felt need is relevant solely on condition that after the usual test for patentability have been conducted there is genuine doubt as to how to decide the issue invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.742" offset="2694353">We have the really significant question here as to how much importance may be attached to commercial success when the only evidence of that success have been adduced by plaintiff relates to but one element of a patented combination that being the radiant energy generator as claimed of the Schwank type.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.259" offset="2796440">The two engineers who testified for respondent described the benefits and virtues and glories of using a radiant energy generator of the Schwank type to heat up an asphaltic edge which was to receive new asphalt in abutting relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.147" offset="2871986">They did not testify as of the success of or the unexpected benefits flowing from the combination paver and heater which is the subject of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.821" offset="2926634">It is the combination which is the supposed invention not the heater per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.686" offset="2946069">The original claims as filed in the Patent Office attempted to claim the heater per se in connection with its use in highway construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.638" offset="2985880">But those claims that Neville failed to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.466" offset="3001240">He also claimed -- he also attempted to get claims to a process for using such a generator.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.146" offset="3027989">And those claims he failed to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.112" offset="3039796">So he is now in a position where he can only assert, to discuss the scope of his invention the entire combination of conventional road paver and specific type of radiant energy generator.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="768.162" offset="3176051">But technically, it is your claim that this is an aggregation and I understand your submission is that the law is that a mere aggregation is never patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.743" offset="3222340">A combination may be patentable if it combines all elements to reach a new and unanticipated result.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.534" offset="3249507">Is that your --?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_w_borst" startTime="787.391" stopTime="1240.207">
            <label>Mr. Alan W. Borst</label>
            <text syncTime="787.391" offset="3252955">That is our position, perfectly stated Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.752" offset="3270405">The question naturally, therefore, presents itself as to whether the respondent's testimony on commercial success is even relevant since it goes only to the benefits of one element of an assembly of elements as patented which is whether there is any invention in this assembly of old elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.512" offset="3345429">So let us look at the so-called narrow issues or steps which occupy the attention of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.048" offset="3375522">In fact, these issues involve the scope and relevancy of the prior art to this development.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.334" offset="3420662">It involved the question as to whether the patentee had solved a problem which had hit it to essentially defied solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.422" offset="3461099">And it went into this question of aggregation which we feel was treated rather cavalierly by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.549" offset="3505612">The prior art in this case which the petitioner considers most pertinent is the British patent which I have previously alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.005" offset="3555349">The Morcom patent number 709014 which issued on 1905 and of course the Schwank patent which shows the radiant energy generator used on the Neville paver.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.681" offset="3622118">Morcom had versed to the basic problem of causing new asphalt to unit with all asphalt in place in road patching.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.378" offset="3660884">And what is Morcom's solution?</text>
            <text syncTime="892.072" offset="3671646">It is exactly and precisely the same as Neville's, namely, the use of radiant energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.980" offset="3703306">Respondent has never tried to contend throughout the trial or the appeals that road patching, in this regard, presents any problem which differs essentially from road construction there being in each case the question of how to get new asphalt which is hot asphalt to unit with old asphalt which has been allowed to grow cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.513" offset="3805393">Both Morcom in 1905 and Neville in 1959 on, some 50 or more years later state that radiant energy prepares the cold surface edge and is less likely to scorch it and say an open flame.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.768" offset="3870490">The British patent shares everything that Neville claims exceptn hat the British street paver heats the marginal asphalt edge with a different type radiant energy heater.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.631" offset="3925870">It is not so denominated in the British patent as a radiant energy heater but as Judge Haynswort in the Forth Circuit correctly stated, it is a radiant energy heater since it comprises a combustion chamber which permits and which provides for the firing of gaseous materials within and an escape or discharge opening causing the bottom of the heater to raise its temperature.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.868" offset="4066826">And, therefore of necessity becomes a source of radiant heat from a scientific point of view; anybody in fact which have a temperature of in excess of absolute zero degrees is a source of radiant heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.816" offset="4150627">Secondly, he would seem that if radiant heat was desirable, suggested by Morcom, such a heater of any type could be obviously substituted for the radiation heater in the British claim without making invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.356" offset="4220844">Schwank, as explained, shows the heater as that component's claimed in Neville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.102" offset="4239757">And that patent is in fact mentioned in the Neville patent as been exposing a heater which is suitable for the patentee's purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.387" offset="4280926">The District Court went on to discuss this question of aggregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.179" offset="4300048">There is no question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.661" offset="4306004">And respondents' experts and certainly petitioners' expert have agreed that the paver operates entirely independently of the heater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.979" offset="4367339">And the heater operates independently of the paver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.443" offset="4389177">Therefore, the heater will function in precisely the same manner where the tamper, for example, has been operated whether the distributor is actually laying material or whether the screed as there to smooth the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.385" offset="4492936">This is a unquestioned fact as well, that the heater in constructing the adjoining road blocks of a single lane is removed from the paver and is placed on a separate mobile support and used to make the transverse edge of the two adjoining highway blocks in the single lane of highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.144" offset="4623966">In discussing this whole question, this court, in deciding the Lincoln Engineering case which is so heavily relied upon in its briefs and petitions, found that at least one definition of aggregation was that the total of the old elements must somehow exceed the sum of the parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.389" offset="4720933">And then finding the system there disclosed which was a system for injecting grease into the bearings of automobile which included a piston pump on a conduit communicating therewith and a coupling consisting of jaws were aggregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.674" offset="4826049">They bank the court makes at that time an observation which we think is peculiarly applicable to the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.457" offset="4857187">The court, perhaps, overturn suggested that if the patentee had addressed his claims to the jaws perceived, he might have found himself with a valid patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.939" offset="4935137">But in fact, he did not and then by the time this patent got before this court it was, of course, too late to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.626" offset="4973902">It might be of interest to this court to note that there are several cases in Great Britain which deal with the subject of aggregation which have not been brought to its attention in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.864" offset="5050807">And I thought I might do it now, if the court indulges me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.373" offset="9604890">First of all, there are several matters here which I think are beyond dispute if you look at the record as distinguished from arguments and contentions of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.311" offset="9640626">First of all, Neville did create a new combination of elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.749" offset="9734353">He was Era Oil's Vice President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.570" offset="9745638">And at pages 40, 41, 42 A in the printed appendix, I asked him where he found the elements of the Neville patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.726" offset="9782314">And he said, “You have to look at all the prior art to find it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.272" offset="9800495">Those were some eight pieces of prior art in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.361" offset="9812825">So, he had to look at eight of them in order to find the Neville patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.167" offset="9836022">So, we say on that basis and upon a review of the element of the prior art individually that this was a new combination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.475" offset="10301315">It showed a complete difference between the combination of the patented suit and what had been done before that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.911" offset="10343006">Now, this brings me to what is the essential point and that is the elimination of the cold joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.784" offset="10370487">This arises when you lay two lanes of asphalt bituminous black top, whatever you would like to call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.995" offset="10411342">It's the sort off thing, we see on the ordinary highway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2600.671" offset="10506010">He concede that if you put on a radiant energy at the joint area as you lay the second, a budding course, that then he would eliminate this cold joint where you never had a really good matching or marriage, as they call it, between the two mats which have been laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.385" offset="10600887">And he went around established people and he tried to make his point with them and got nowhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.931" offset="10759084">I want to go a little bit further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.888" offset="10766921">We have all spoken here in the courtroom in very generalized terms of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.020" offset="10787401">But I want to take that a little bit further if I may?</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.014" offset="10799417">The claim which is printed and I would not try to deal with it orally is lengthy, specific and detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.731" offset="10838288">It is in reality a narrow claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.082" offset="10851662">And if you go through it, you will find many, many limitations and requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.300" offset="10868590">Each of which must be met in order to infringe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.224" offset="10888234">It is not a broad claim at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.379" offset="10900877">Now, the point I make from that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.585" offset="10917700">If this claim is so narrow, it certainly is an easy thing to avoid infringement by changing the few of these details.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.419" offset="10961063">And you can make so much more radical changes than trying to mount these on two separate chassis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.979" offset="10987290">You can still stay on one chassis but you can certainly avoid infringement very easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.798" offset="11006516">They do not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.981" offset="11015293">And the reason is, of course, that there is no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.412" offset="11028982">This is the essential scheme which we think demonstrates eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.426" offset="11105050">Now, speaking again very broadly without going in to these details of the claimed language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.750" offset="11130337">There are three elements which we have talked about for convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.164" offset="11152071">These are the asphalt or bituminous spreader and then the screed element which shapes it and you also have the radiant energy generator which bears upon the previously laid lane and which makes it receptive for the asphalt which is being laid alongside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.685" offset="11242141">So as the machine goes down the highway, you have the one side a previously laid lane of asphalt, the paver is running beside that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.766" offset="11286444">The radiant energy generator is directing the radiant energy on to the existing lane of asphalt and then a new lane of asphalt is laid alongside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.317" offset="11328658">And because you do have the radiant energy, you get your marriage of the two lanes and you avoid this cold joint and everything that that entails, the problems that arise with matters at court and the testimony in the printed appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.143" offset="11759992">Morcom lacks all of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.151" offset="12251930">There are three Sections of the statute to which we look in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.420" offset="12269066">These have been discussed most recently by these courts in Graham against John Deer and United States against Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.296" offset="12296547">Those are Sections 101, 102 and 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.397" offset="12312952">I may be presumed to state my understanding of it, it would be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.908" offset="12331029">That Section 1 requires that there be an invention in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.184" offset="12356106">I think the defensive aggregation really is statutory and is a Section 101 defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.083" offset="12383692">In short, you must show that you have some elements brought together which do co-act the invention in a patentable or legal sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.043" offset="12563519">And I think that comes from its nature because it is always pushing into the unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.887" offset="12582954">After we know the invention, it is very easy to have 20/20 hindsight and see all about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.099" offset="12603747">But at the time the invention was made, when you are all reaching forward, it is a different matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.938" offset="13299127">No, there have not been any formally made and some suggestions made but there has been nothing brought forward beyond that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.030" offset="13343535">Now, I want to say this, that these cases I see at are all consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.848" offset="13366732">In the Celanese Case which was cited by counsel at the argument is again entirely consistent as I heard him read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.061" offset="13407587">And those stand as I see it for this proposition, if you have several elements, each independently hold, and if you bring them together and if they co-act to produce a new result -- In other words, if their co-action adds up to something more than their individual actions, then you have a patentable invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.040" offset="13503509">That was so in Lincoln Engineering against Stewart Warner where a number of the claims were held valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.242" offset="13540289">And we think that that is properly so here for this reason that if you omit the radiant energy generator you will get the cold joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.543" offset="13593579">If you omit the spreader you would not have a pavement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.683" offset="13610088">If you omit the shaper you would not have a pavement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.211" offset="13624195">You must bring these three together and operate them together in order to get this new and admittedly beneficial result which is the elimination of the cold joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.510" offset="13669439">Now, my difficulty as I understand it here is that the petitioner declines to deal with the overall result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.300" offset="13712593">It is not answer to say these are not mechanically connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.730" offset="13726281">Of course they are not mechanically connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.665" offset="13734013">They are acting at different places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.146" offset="13743940">But when they act at different places and the process is finished, you have a new result brought about by this machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.122" offset="13783855">The difficulty, it seems to me, is one which was characterized by Mr. Justice Holmes, a good many years ago in a trademark case, I believe, of breaking the fagot, stick by stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.021" offset="13843414">They declined to look at the overall situation which exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.027" offset="13863476">We think that when that overall situation is examined as we think that was properly done by Judges Haynswort and Sobeloff of Court of Appeals that the necessary result is that you have here a new beneficial combination, one which was not obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.979" offset="13951248">We think that the District Judge and Judge Craven ignored the overall result and focused if you will on too narrow a point of view of looking at the individual elements and not looking at the overall combination and recognizing the new result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.601" offset="14041736">Cordially, we ask that the judgment will all be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.745" offset="14058350">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.920" offset="14147062">Era Oil only makes the heater and so it hardly could be extolling the combination which is claimed, the heater plus the paver.</text>
