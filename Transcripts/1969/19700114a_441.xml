            <text syncTime="24.256" offset="200391">The petitioner in this case was born in 1941 in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.107" offset="227767">He became 18 on June 23, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.766" offset="250441">He failed to register for the draft, the reasons of conscience and was indicted after an arrest in February of 1967, almost eight years after his initial failure to register.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="55.766" offset="326405">Now Mr. Gurfein, when you say he failed to register for reasons of conscience, he did not make any record or take any step or did he at that time to record that fact?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="murray_i_gurfein" startTime="67.635" stopTime="83.697">
            <label>Mr. Murray I. Gurfein</label>
            <text syncTime="67.635" offset="373948">He took no steps but if I may, Your Honor in connection with my argument on the First Amendment, I shall try to expand that a little further.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.307" offset="404564">I'm trying to make a summary statement of facts now so that I can indicate to the Court the three points we should like to argue within the short space of time allotted.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="83.697" stopTime="84.751">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="83.697" offset="438209">Very well.</text>

          <turn speaker="murray_i_gurfein" startTime="84.751" stopTime="358.854">
            <label>Mr. Murray I. Gurfein</label>
            <text syncTime="84.751" offset="442389">The first statement I want to make on that is that I will not get involve at this time in the reasons why the record indicates that there was a sincerity of belief on the part of the petitioner that he could not take part in the registration process itself because his was a pristine religious view that the registration process itself was merely an extension of the war making in which he was against.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.102" offset="579793">It should be recalled that in 1959 when the petitioner willfully failed to register, there was no war going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.389" offset="616887">The Korean War had been finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.739" offset="626291">There was no Vietnam War at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.494" offset="649383">As I say, he was arrested eight years after the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.511" offset="665370">The general statute of limitations as we know is a five-year statute and in the words of that statute except as otherwise provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.597" offset="721795">Adequate and proper motion was made to dismiss prior to the trial on the basis of the statute of limitations having run which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.656" offset="762023">The trial was held and at the trial counsel for petitioner requested a jury charge to the effect that if the jury believe in the sincerity of the religious beliefs of the petitioner and that his failure to register was due to his religious conscience that they should acquit.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.591" offset="853765">This request to charge was denied by the trial Court and a conviction by the jury and suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.422" offset="889083">In this Court as we did below, we make three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.666" offset="910085">First, that the statute of limitations is a five-year statute and that any extension beyond it is beyond the legislative intention, the congressional intention and indeed the prerogative of the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.752" offset="974346">Secondly, we say that if the statute of limitations point to save.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.066" offset="1003604">It is only save thus the court below indicated by holding that a regulation and not a statute created a continuing duty to register and that by just the possession of the words, the continuing duty even though Congress said nothing about a continuing offense, ipso facto made a continuous offense as if Congress had specifically mandated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.491" offset="1117288">And if that be the construction of the statute, then it is violative of the Fifth Amendment privilege of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.039" offset="1163577">The last point which I hope we shall have some time to discuss is that we believe that under the First Amendment, the minimum that we are asking here is covered by that Amendment and that is, that when a religious principle objector, objects the registration as part of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.674" offset="1262111">While it is true, he must subject himself to the criminal process at the same time he has a right when he is tried to a jury to have an instruction that if the jury believes he is religiously sincere that they should recognize in the context of this whole problem, his religious conscience under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.445" offset="1357197">Now, if I may turn first to the statute of limitations, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.589" offset="1381752">As a result of the decision below by the distinguished Second Court of Appeals, Second Circuit Court of Appeals as well as other Circuits, we are now in the state of law that a narcotics peddler is subject to a statute of limitations of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.586" offset="1449671">A man who sells defense secrets to a foreign government is subject to a statute of limitations of ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.564" offset="1481644">The boy of 18 who fails to register for Selective Service is subject to a statute of limitations of 13 years and the questions is, how did this come about and is this harsh result sound.</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray I. Gurfein</label>
            <text syncTime="404.422" offset="1721031">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.570" offset="1725628">I need to spell it out because I thought it was obvious but what the court did below in order to get around this problem was to say although the regulation which I shall read in a minute, perhaps I’ll read it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.637" offset="1769932">Although the regulation says that the duty the register shall be continuous at all times, two circuits have construed at all times to mean for life apparently because there are two circuits that seem to upheld that even if the man is over 26, rather is the statute goes beyond age 26, he can still be prosecuted which would make a man of 70 subject to prosecution and this Court had a collateral problem like that Gara which was affirmed by a divided court four to four in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.391" offset="1900962">But it was a collateral case so we really don’t know what the court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.760" offset="1914441">Now in the Second Circuit, they held that the regulation merely limited to 26 and therefore it’s obvious that a boy of 18 must wait till 26 which is eight years and then five years thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.142" offset="1971911">It’s five and that’s where I get my 13 years which is exactly what was done below in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.793" offset="1994585">Now, the regulation, I don’t think means, I say this with most respect designation, what it has been construed to me and I don’t think it needs much of a gloss as to what was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.101" offset="2055816">At page 813 of our brief in the appendix, the regulation says, the duty of every person subject to registration to present himself for and submit to registration shall continue at all times and if for any reason, any such person is not registered on the day or one of the days fixed his registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.228" offset="2132302">He should immediately present himself for and submit to registration before the local board in the area where you have to submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.222" offset="2164276">And the word immediately, the very peculiar word, if you’re talking about a continuing duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.544" offset="2189563">It seems to me that the fair entrance of this is that in issuing the regulations under the statute which permitted the President to fix the time with times and place of place of registration which naturally Congress had to do, they could not watch everyday the registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.688" offset="2250167">But all these means is that if a man was sick or absent from the country or out of town or something else happened which was not willful that he should not believe that he was thereafter forever discharged from his duty because at age 18 he could not register.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.959" offset="2307218">Otherwise, the word immediately makes very little sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.542" offset="2317563">And I say, if we can take it in this context, Your Honors, you have a very simple administrative regulation here that there’s not in its face before to create a real continuing duty and certainly on its face, there’s nothing about a continuing effects.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.728" offset="2378271">What would be the impact of that regulation if you omitted the word immediately in your view?</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray I. Gurfein</label>
            <text syncTime="574.899" offset="2402931">Well, I think immediately if just to gloss and I can’t read the mind of Congress not of the drafters of the regulation, Mr. the Chief Justice.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="581.746" stopTime="587.399">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="581.746" offset="2430307">But suppose we took it out now.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.564" offset="2441592">Would it mean anything different?</text>

          <turn speaker="murray_i_gurfein" startTime="587.399" stopTime="781.863">
            <label>Mr. Murray I. Gurfein</label>
            <text syncTime="587.399" offset="2452982">Well, I think the purpose of it is not to catch willful offender to violate the law that beyond the pale.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.359" offset="2476805">I think this is for the purpose of notifying people for a perfectly ready, willing, and able to register under the draft law to a simple point that if they are not available on the day when they are suppose to register, that they’re suppose to register thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.029" offset="2539499">Now when it says immediately Mr. Chief Justice, I think the same result should follow but I think the word immediately does tend to help us in construing it merely as an administrative regulation and not as the courts below did as an effect and substitution for a statute extending the general statute of limitations beyond five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.251" offset="2628420">Now, the process by which the court below arrived at extending statute was by acknowledging very frankly and the opinion of the Second Circuit certainly is a distinguished opinion in terms of facing the problems that arose and let me decided against this, we said we cannot complain about the fairness of the judicial reasoning that led to the result and they recognize all the problems there.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.260" offset="2740433">That Court did not as the Government now contends say that you can read anything into that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.373" offset="2764884">They honestly said, we cannot read it into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.359" offset="2776795">There isn’t any such thing because the statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.738" offset="2790275">The general statute just accept according as otherwise provided according to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.581" offset="2813680">Assume the Congress can make a 13 years statute of limitations and none of the your question Mr. Justice Black if it chose to but the question is, did it choose to?</text>
            <text syncTime="687.279" offset="2852446">What is there in this statute which simply says that the President may say when a boy shall come in and register?</text>
            <text syncTime="694.843" offset="2882748">What is there in that statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="696.641" offset="2889958">It gives the Executive power to promulgate what the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recognize as in practical effect and extension of the statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.915" offset="2931022">Now, we think that this Court over the years and misquote way back as always lean over backwards if I may use the colloquial phrase with respect to statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.539" offset="2977520">It runs against the grain of lawyers and judges, generally, the whole system of criminal justice to permit by extensions by back way or back doors methods by ambiguities the creation of extensions of statutes of limitation and this Court has so held many time.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.339" offset="3056724">Now, the reason for it is perfectly obvious and I go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.764" offset="3082428">It seems to us that in the historical material that we put into the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.343" offset="3104789">Your Honors, we’ll see that going back to England and going back to the colonies and certainly to the beginning of the Republic, there has not have been any question but that a statute of limitations must be created by the legislature and not by the Executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.885" offset="3162885">And it’s one of those fundamental things in the separation of powers that it sees to me has gone through all the vicissitudes of various attempts to try to change by indirection generally at the instance of the Government the normal rules applicable to the meaning of English words and so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.126" offset="5155924">The -- once you say that the only reason to see the petitioner here is in trouble is because you extended that statute of limitations because he had a compulsory duty to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.573" offset="5217677">Then it is if you are creating two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.660" offset="5233977">You have first the statute which makes him a criminal because of I think we all concede, he certainly could have been arrested shortly after his 18th birthday if he willfully fail to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.259" offset="5280371">And then you say to him, now you are compelled to register and by registering, identify yourself with your name and age and birthday and by that very identification, you are submitting yourself to prosecution in a sense of whether this is an all force with even Albertson and Marchetti in spirit and theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.007" offset="5383398">It is an even more pristine violation of the statute of limitations because here you do have an act which can't be equivocal really, the act itself of registering and giving your name and birthday is enough to convict you so we don’t have talk here about change and links and evidence and substantial danger of incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.939" offset="5459153">Now, and we suggest that in that context and I must say the Third Circuit by the way if it 1955 before this whole series of cases indicated that there was a Fifth Amendment problem in alien registration cases and we’ve cited it in our brief there might be of some interest, they didn’t have to decide it for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.247" offset="5544312">And so we say that in this context, the draft resister and the other class, there’s no use denying the fact that there have been number of willful resisters that these people are in a select class of the kind that this Court has spoken of who are asked to come forward, give the names on the compulsion and hence be subject to prosecution under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.068" offset="5975646">That clearly wouldn’t be against the Fifth Amendment, under the amendment itself and under the case and so we say this is analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.993" offset="5999365">Now, on the First Amendment, the court itself below, the Second Circuit said that in theory, it is true that a conscientious objected to the process of registration or to have a right, to have the jury pay us on the sincerity of this belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.689" offset="6066134">But unfortunately they said, I don’t say unfortunate I hated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.533" offset="6081494">Under present doctrine, we can't allow that stand and we query what and present doctrine should support that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.624" offset="6125902">We think that there is no doubt that Toussie stands convicted here because of his religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.788" offset="6150562">I don’t think the Government says that he doesn’t stand convicted because of religious beliefs, if so he is convicted for the exercise of a First Amendment right directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.076" offset="6191626">Now, if he exercise that First Amendment right directly, should he not have the opportunity to have a jury pass on the sincerity of his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.590" offset="6233736">In other words, under Sherbert against Verner and they way the Court has been determining this First Amendment questions lately, it’s no longer a question as I see it if whether there is a vague constitutional exemption for conscientious objectors generally, that is not the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.823" offset="6306670">The issue is if a man in the exercise of his First Amendment rights, honestly and conscientiously believes that registration is part of the process of killing and will not register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.792" offset="6350555">Is he then to be sent to jail without any defense or whatever?</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.252" offset="6368423">And the question of course is one of balancing when the Sherbert against Verner and Shapiro and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.116" offset="6391829">This Court has now said that in the balancing of this interest, we do not look to see whether it’s a reasonable regulation but whether there is a compelling reason as to why the Government must have this and we vent you to say with the utmost respect that in this context, the Government doesn’t need to send people to jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.415" offset="7521050">As counsel has indicated, petitioner makes what is basically a three-problem attack on our views conviction for non registration with Selected Service System.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.903" offset="7655006">And he says third, that in all events, his religious beliefs provide him defense since can tell the conviction that he should not even submit to registration or that the list, the court should have submitted that issue to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.501" offset="7741419">I think the central fallacy of the statute of limitations argument was alluded to by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.721" offset="7778304">The result as we see it if the petitioner is correct is that at age 23, when he says the five-year statute of limitations would have run, he will no longer be subject to registration and I don’t see anything that makes him subject to registration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.182" offset="7960116">Basically, the offense that petitioner is charged with is one of failing the register with the Selective Service System not simply upon reaching age 18 when he is required to but failing to register it all during a period of time between age 18 and age 26 during which the regulation and we think by fair application to statutes that the regulation sought to implement and effectuate require that he performs his duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.919" offset="11447045">The first place as I indicated his coming in voluntary cast the question initially on the willfulness of the original offense on whether the prosecution would be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.470" offset="11497200">And also it seems to us and this is I think the central point on which the Court of Appeals rely is that there isn’t any real compulsion that’s working on him to force him to come in after he first fail to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.992" offset="11551326">This is a continuing offense we accept that and we have to accept that proposition in order to get to the privilege question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.874" offset="13806843">The question would be whether the statute would grant it at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.033" offset="13823457">The several other comments on the privilege of defense that the petitioner search as I sought to allude to, there’s some question whether he even asked standing interest to assert that defense, he has made it clear indeed and his point three years made it demonstrably plain that he never intended to register at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.755" offset="13922408">Indeed he says that his religious beliefs prevented him to doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.643" offset="13937977">So it seems to us there’s some real question about whether he is in a position to say that he was deterred from registering at some later point in time because of potential self- incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.197" offset="13996178">The Marchetti and Grosso line up decisions, we sought in our brief to distinguish those, it seems to us that the distinctions are rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.154" offset="14027943">First, they relate to initial registration and an area permeated with criminal statutes relating people inherently suspect of criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.962" offset="14067231">Petitioner as counsel suggests that he’s in that same category once he has failed initially to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.541" offset="14089488">We don’t think that as long as it is indicated to Mr. Justice Stewart, there are a number of people who have responsibility to register later point in time and there are also people who for one reason or another have excusably failed to register and may come in at later point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.092" offset="14151764">They indicated that the Chief Justice, we view the position here suggested whatever distinctions might sought to be made and basically a far reaching one as the court accepts it on the privilege question that will take it beyond anything that it’s done thus far in the Fifth Amendment area and that we think will seriously impair the ability of the Government to obtain necessary information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.171" offset="14248103">This is a big country and as the court has pointed out several opinions Grosso and Marchetti, indeed also pointed this out the government’s need for people to come forward with information as in essential pre requisite to effective and orderly operation of a variety of schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.896" offset="14322918">We can suggest the number of analogies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.420" offset="14333053">I suggest that some of them to the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.552" offset="14345592">On the last point, it seems to us that it doesn’t really require despite the rather elaborate development by petitioner very much come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.322" offset="14396688">This Court has continually recognized that Congress has preceded and a reasonable and sensible fashion in establishing procedures for determining conscientious objection and the exemption from military service on the basis of that objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.800" offset="14462621">It seems to us that all of these cases Nugent, Seeger, the case is at presently before the Court all indicate that the procedure that has been established, there’s a reasonable, sensible sound one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.868" offset="14518836">We don’t know of any case that stands for the proposition, Mr. Justice Harlan raised that the First Amendment of itself requires that conscientious objectors be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.717" offset="14570245">Unfortunately, the Congress has not seen fit to force this Court to that issue because Congress has taken into account conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.304" offset="14608593">It goes back as petitioner indicated historically even to colonial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.964" offset="14627192">But the question comes down simply to a very narrow one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.697" offset="14642134">Is the burden assuming that some First Amendment rights exist is the burden to come in and register and do nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.758" offset="14682363">Come in and register and submit to a readily available, sensible reasonable process for the determining conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.192" offset="14716113">Is that burden such a great one that it should be given constitutional protection?</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.670" offset="14738056">We submit that it’s not that as a sensible scheme to have all people come in and identify themselves initially with the Government so that the Selective Service System can have available to read records including the entirety of the manpower pool available and then there’s a procedure going on from there to determine conscientious objection.</text>
