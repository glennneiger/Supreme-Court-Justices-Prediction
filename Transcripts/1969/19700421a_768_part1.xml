            <label>Mr. Joseph M. Mclaughlin</label>
            <text syncTime="56.435" offset="329122">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.069" offset="343646">This case presents an issue which this Court faced eight years ago in Sinclair Refining Company versus Atkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.005" offset="379382">The question is again here today as well as an additional questionnaire to the -- was not present in Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.773" offset="410415">The issue basically is whether federal courts have jurisdiction under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 to enjoin strikes and work stoppages by labor organizations in violation of their promises contained in their labor agreements not to engage in strikes or work stoppages during the term of the labor agreement and to submit such disputes to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.577" offset="537684">This involves the question as to whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act should be accommodated to Section 301 and held not to bar the issuance of injunctions against strikes in breach or promise to arbitrate and not to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.273" offset="604453">So the continuing validity of this Court's decision in Sinclair is squarely at issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.840" offset="634755">Also, there's a subsidiary question and that relates to the continued vitality of state court injunctions in the federal court after removal under Avco, that is assuming that this Court finds that Sinclair was rightly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.825" offset="734647">The factual background is simple, the petitioner and the respondent, at all times material hereto, were parties to a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.414" offset="777070">On that agreement provided in pertinent parts that all disputes involving in any way the interpretation and application of the agreement shall be submitted to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.787" offset="826493">It further contained a specific agreement that there would be no strikes, cessations of work, picketing, boycotts or lockouts during the term of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.550" offset="873618">It contained yet another specific provision namely that matters subject to the arbitration procedure should be settled and resolved by that established procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.802" offset="926595">The employer operates a chain of some 35 supermarkets.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.224" offset="944253">On a particular day in 1969, the employer was utilizing some non-union -- some non-bargaining unit personnel to stock a frozen food case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.411" offset="988975">A union business agent observed this and objected, demanded that the employer cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.461" offset="1013217">The employer believing that he was not in violation of the contract refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.786" offset="1030562">The union called a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.210" offset="1036204">All the employees left the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.365" offset="1044877">Picketing commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.092" offset="1051773">The customers were told that the store has closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.497" offset="1061386">There is no service.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.385" offset="1068910">Pickets carried signs saying, “Local 770, this store on strike, please respect our picket lines.”</text>
            <text syncTime="248.819" offset="1098689">The employer demanded arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.382" offset="1108929">The union refused and continued to picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.078" offset="1119692">The employer went to the Superior Court, County of Los Angeles and obtained a temporary restraining order and also an order to show cause by preliminary injunction was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.597" offset="1161801">Now in connection with this state court procedure, union counsel was notified as provided by local court rule after argument in chambers in consideration of the verified complaints, the affidavits and the likes, the order was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.914" offset="1211016">Now the temporary restraining order enjoined the work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.273" offset="1224495">The union responded promptly by removing the case to the federal court and in the federal court filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.822" offset="1262634">In opposition, the employer filed in the federal court a motion for an order compelling arbitration for an order requiring specific performance of the agreement to arbitrate and application for a preliminary injunction against the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.284" offset="1320521">Now the district judge was well aware of Avco and was well aware of this Court's decision in Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.537" offset="1345494">And after consideration of the arguments of the parties in the various documents submitted, he denied the union's motion to quash the state court injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.912" offset="1383006">He granted the employer's motion for an order compelling arbitration in enjoining the work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.248" offset="1404322">The union appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed the District Court on the ground of Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.547" offset="1437550">Now Your Honors, the underlying premise of the trilogy in Lincoln Mills of the law which this Court has developed under Section 301 is that arbitration is the most favorable solution, the most feasible solution to industrial warfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.033" offset="1503483">Adjudication on the merits is to be substituted for muscle.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.645" offset="1525948">This Court has said that the no strike agreement is the quid pro quo for the employer's agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.551" offset="1553533">Now, if unions are free to strike and the employer is bound to arbitrate, this does not only mean that the employer doesn't receive his bargain, the benefit of this bargain which is really about the only thing an employer gets from a labor agreement but also most serious imbalance results.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.463" offset="1625213">This Court has said that arbitration is the kingpin of the federal labor policy under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.716" offset="1654262">Well, the kingpin is destroyed by the strike in breach of contract where the union is obligated to arbitrate the underlying union.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.692" offset="1842134">The decision of 1962 is simply out of harmony with the congressional policy which this Court has found in Section 301 that is that the federal courts under Section 301 are to develop a body of federal labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.510" offset="1901380">And as I'm pointing out before, arbitration has been declared to be the kingpin of that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.215" offset="1924263">Now the objection at the Norris-LaGuardia Act forbids what almost every commentator what agrees is necessary and desirable is simply not sound because you can adopt, you can accommodate Section 301, Norris-LaGuardia Act so as to give the fullest possible effect to the central purpose of those statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.465" offset="2197191">Now, no viable distinction, it seems to me at least can be made between the accommodation of Chicago River and the failure to accommodate in Sinclair with Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.866" offset="2246823">The only distinction is that in Chicago River the arbitrator was a National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.268" offset="2276394">And here under Taft-Hartley Section 301, it's an arbitrator who was selected through the contractually agreed upon procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.912" offset="2310980">I respectfully submit that the question that was asked or the question rather that was stated in the Court's opinion in Sinclair was the wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.082" offset="2359672">The opinion of the court starts off stating the question as being whether Section 301 and I believe the phrase used is “impliedly repealed” Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.886" offset="2406902">I think the answer to that is obviously no.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.648" offset="2421948">I think the proper question, I would respectfully suggest, is a question as to whether the statute should be accommodated to each other and I think the answer there is just as obvious and its yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.486" offset="7001318">Now, I would suggest that a proper accommodation of Norris-LaGuardia and Section 301 sanctions the injunction in this case, it's a vital part of Section 301's effectuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.016" offset="7051473">I would say that the availability of the injunction is far more necessary to Section 301 than it is detrimental to Norris-LaGuardia and therefore its respectfully submitted that the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit should be reversed with instructions to affirm the order of the District Court.</text>
