            <text syncTime="17.350" offset="172805">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.943" offset="187120">This is a criminal prosecution under the federal food and drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.621" offset="209899">Respondents and Detroit Vital Foods Incorporated, the corporation of which they were officers were convicted after a jury trial on five counts of an indictment charging them with misbranding of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.894" offset="278967">The corporation is not before this Court on present petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.540" offset="297566">The sentences imposed by the District Court are summarized in our brief on pages 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.868" offset="326823">The evidence showed that respondent Kordel was President of the corporation and the author of books and leaflets promoting its products and that he traveled across the country delivering lectures which were advertised and open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.069" offset="395682">The writings and lectures claimed that specified ailments could alleviated by the consumption of certain foods and food elements and that the best sources of these were the products offered for sale by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.911" offset="459003">These products were sold in booths and/or near the lecture halls and were also available in health food stores generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.070" offset="495679">Respondent Feldten acted as Kordel's assistant selling products at the lectures and taking orders for shipments from Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.841" offset="534758">The criminal charges were that as to some of the products certain of the books and leaflets constituted part of the labeling and contained false and misleading statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.905" offset="590973">And as to all of the counts on which respondents were convicted, the products which they claim to be merely food supplements were in fact drugs because they were intended by the defendants to be used for the prevention and treatment of various diseases and health conditions, and that the labeling of these products failed to set forth adequate directions for the uses for which they were intended as required by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.699" offset="734124">Since the oral representations made in respondent Kordel's public lectures were relevant in showing the uses for which the products were intended, tape recordings of his public lectures were introduced into evidence by the Government at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.648" offset="822000">At this point, I believe a summary of the relevant procedural chronology will be helpful to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.852" offset="854810">The indictment in this case was returned in the summer of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.792" offset="882500">Previously, in June of 1960, the Government had filed a libel proceeding under Section 334 of the Act to condemn quantities of the corporation's products as misbranded.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.009" offset="951359">The corporation appeared as claimant in this in rem proceeding and filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.908" offset="990960">The parties then served interrogatories upon each other, pursuant to Rule 33 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.332" offset="1028681">The Government's interrogatories were served in January and April of 1961 and sought among other things detailed information about the labeling, testing, manufacture, and composition of certain of the products and about Kordel's oral representations concerning the efficacy of these products made during public lectures that he gave in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.723" offset="1154278">In late January 1961, shortly after service of the Government's initial interrogatories, the corporation received a notice from the Government pursuant to Section 335 of the Act, indicating that criminal prosecution of the corporation and of respondents was contemplated in part for the same conduct that was the subject of the libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.123" offset="1263888">The corporation then in April 1961 moved that the District Court extend its time to respond to the interrogatories until final disposition of any criminal prosecution that might be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.264" offset="1328462">The District Court denied this motion in June 1961, holding that their was no certainty, when or whether a criminal prosecution would be brought and that there is no prejudice in requiring the corporation to answer the interrogatories since the same information would otherwise become available to the Government in any event from the trial of the libel proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.726" offset="1430235">Pursuant to the Court's order, the corporation then filed answers to some of the interrogatories in September 1961 and filed specific objections to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.674" offset="1474017">In subsequent proceedings, some of the objections were sustained and some are overruled and the Government withdrew some of the interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.943" offset="1507140">The corporation then answered the remaining interrogatories in September 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.932" offset="1531068">Respondent Feldten subscribed to all of the corporation's answers as Vice President and stated that they were true to the best of his knowledge and belief, but that not all of the answers were known to him personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.706" offset="1594180">The libel proceeding thereafter terminated in a consent decree, entered in November 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.821" offset="1630647">In June 1962, after service of the interrogatories and after the corporation's initial answers, but prior to its supplemental answers, the Food and Drug Administration referred the matter to the Department of Justice with the recommendation for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.012" offset="1711417">The indictment was returned in August 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.297" offset="1732524">In March 1965, defendants in the criminal case moved to suppress any evidence obtained by the Government as a result of the corporation's answers to the interrogatories in the libel proceeding or in the alternative for a hearing to determine the Government's motive in bringing the civil action and serving the interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.376" offset="1832835">The District Court granted the alternative request for a hearing which lasted three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.794" offset="1862510">The transcript of the hearing, set forth in the appendix at pages 58 to 290, showed that at the time the civil case was filed, the Food and Drug Administration already had evidence sufficient in its judgment to establish all the elements of the criminal violations, but had not yet decided whether to recommend criminal prosecution that the agency determined that the in rem seizure proceeding should be commenced promptly in order to prevent harm to the public from continued distribution of the misbranded drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.810" offset="2034604">And that the interrogatories were designed solely for the purposes of the civil suit and were submitted as they are routinely in such suits in an effort to narrow the issues for trial and in the hope of laying the foundation for a motion for summary judgment or possibly inducing the corporation to agree to a consent decree by demonstrating the insubstantiality of its case which is what eventually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.711" offset="2166262">The District Court held on the basis of this hearing that the governmental decisions to commence the civil suit and to serve the interrogatories were made in good faith and not for the purpose of procuring evidence for a criminal prosecution, and the conviction followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.076" offset="2255705">And while not disagreeing with these findings, the Court of Appeals reversed respondent's convictions on the ground that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination of the individual criminal defendants have been violated by requiring the corporation to answer the interrogatories in the civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.651" offset="2349955">The Court held that it was constitutionally insufficient that the Government had acted in good faith in the civil proceeding and that none of the answers to the interrogatories had been introduced into evidence in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.302" offset="2412544">It held that the Government must also prove that it had not in anyway utilized for purposes of the criminal case, information or leads obtained from the answers to the interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.251" offset="2480358">In its initial opinion, the Court of Appeals also reversed the corporation's conviction, but on the Government's petition for rehearing, it modified its opinion in judgment so as to affirm that conviction on the ground that the privilege against self-incrimination is available under this Court's decisions only to natural persons and not to a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.566" offset="2577638">A petition for certiorari by the corporation was denied by this Court and a petition for rehearing is presently pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.889" offset="2618911">We contend, first, that the Court of Appeals aired in holding that respondents privilege against self-incrimination had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.915" offset="2663006">Neither of the respondents had interposed any claim to the seized drugs, nor did either of them have a personal property interest in the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.414" offset="2708982">Neither of them was party to the civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.965" offset="2723192">Neither of them was obligated or required to answer any of the interrogatories served on the corporation in that proceeding, and indeed, respondent Kordel supplied no answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.270" offset="2772407">And respondent Feldten who did submit answers on behalf of the corporation stated therein that the truth of the answers was not known to him personally, so the answers did not constitute an admission on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.292" offset="2840534">And finally, neither respondent in anyway claimed that his privilege was being violated when respondent Feldten submitted the answers on behalf of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.732" offset="2898317">The explicit language of Rule 33 dealing with interrogatories and the decisions implementing the rule make clear that when a corporation is the party served with interrogatories, the corporation is obligated to appoint an agent who without fear of self-incrimination can furnish such requested information as is available to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.282" offset="3024541">No claim was made in the libel proceeding that answers to any of the questions were not available to the corporation within the meaning of the rule because the only repositories of the information were individuals who might incriminate themselves by disclosing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.040" offset="3103535">No individual is required under the rule to submit any answer on the corporation's behalf that might tend to incriminate him personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.830" offset="3150660">But the corporation which under this Court's decisions has no privilege against self-incrimination and cannot invoke the privilege of any individual on its behalf remains obligated under the rule to provide such requested information as is available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.012" offset="3231431">To the extent that this obligation with the attendant risk that failure of the corporation to comply might result in a judgment forfeiting the corporation's property constitutes compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.149" offset="3296005">It is compulsion of the corporation which has no privilege and not of the respondents as officers or shareholders of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.685" offset="3346160">To hold otherwise would be to overrule Campbell Painting Corporation against Reid in volume 392 U.S. and its predecessor decisions because compulsion of a corporation to provide possibly incriminating information can always be said to amount to compulsion of its individual officers or shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.107" offset="3451800">They cannot utilized the corporate form of doing business and yet claim a personal interest in the corporation's property only for purposes of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.691" offset="3506134">That is the meaning of these Court's decisions and it was error in our view for the Court of Appeals to hold to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.431" offset="4349053">We have also addressed our brief to the broader concern which seems to underlie the decision of the Court of Appeals the question of fairness in the administration by Government agencies in this and other fields of their responsibilities under statutes which provide for the possibility of both civil and criminal remedies against defending corporations or individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.575" offset="4461693">Our brief discusses the practices and experiences of several agencies and articulates some general criteria which seem to us to be suggested by the leading cases in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.078" offset="4511640">And we also discuss the matter to which I would now like to turn our contention that there was no unfairness in the administration of the food and drug laws in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.461" offset="4565243">There was in the first place an important need to protect the public from harm here as is frequently true in food and drug or in securities fraud cases for that matter, by commencing the civil proceedings promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.896" offset="4638908">It was at the very least reasonable for the responsible officials to decide that this protection of the public should not await determination of whether a criminal prosecution would also be appropriate, let alone final disposition of any criminal proceeding that might be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.364" offset="4728874">Moreover, it was important to proceed to judgment in the condemnation case because Congress has for good reasons referred to in our brief, provided in Section 334 of the Act set forth at pages 26 and 27 of our brief that the Government must obtain a favorable judgment in a forfeiture case before it can proceed by multiple seizures against traditional quantities of the drugs being marketed elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.745" offset="4878399">The interrogatories served on the corporation were found after a hearing to have been designed in good faith for the legitimate purpose of expediting the civil suit to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.464" offset="4929181">The questions asked were relevant to the issues in the civil proceeding even though, the Court of Appeals seem to believed that some of them were not apparently because it did not appreciate the bearing of respondent Kordel's oral representations of the public lectures on the theory of the Government civil case, which dependent on proof of the uses for which the products being marketed by the corporation were intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.252" offset="5072332">In their brief, the respondents suggest a lack of fairness because the Government could have utilized an alternative procedure of seeking interim injunctive relief instead of the libel in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.864" offset="5134817">But the same interrogatories would have been equally irrelevant to establishing the Government's case in an injunctive proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.113" offset="5175777">Moreover, a judgment in an in rem proceeding provides more effective protection of the public because it enables the Government expeditiously to prevent further dissemination of the misbranded drugs by anyone holding them for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.697" offset="5254144">A final indication of the Government's fairness in this case is to be found in the fact that shortly after service of the initial interrogatories and prior to the corporation's answering of them, the Government notified the corporation pursuant to Section 335 of the Act, that criminal prosecution of respondents and the corporation was being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.196" offset="5364172">Respondents could thus judge whether providing answers to the interrogatories on behalf of the corporation might tend to incriminate them and indeed the not very revealing answers actually furnished and set forth in the appendix suggests that this consideration did not escape their attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.219" offset="5568240">Our position is that because the interrogatories were used properly and fairly in a good faith civil suit for the legitimate purposes of that suit, there is no more reason for preventing the Government from basing a criminal investigation on information learned thereby, than there would be for preventing it from basing an investigation on information legitimately revealed in the course of any other good faith civil proceeding whether between private parties or similarly involving the Government as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.034" offset="5727483">Exclusionary rules in their various permutations have after all been held by this Court to be required only where otherwise relevant and competent evidence has been illegally or improperly obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3629.622" offset="14621863">But with respect to the manufacturer that was involved in this case, they wouldn't have such difficulty because they have the answers to the interrogatories.</text>

            <text syncTime="3832.946" offset="15435107">But the availability of multiple seizures as a sanction after in a misbranding case, a favorable judgment is procured and a forfeiture proceeding can served as an inducement to get a consent decree that will eliminate the misbranding which is what we were seeking to do in this case and not to forfeit someone's property that in the absence of the misbranding should be allowed to be disseminated.</text>
