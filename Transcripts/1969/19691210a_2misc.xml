            <text syncTime="46.423" offset="289102">Gentlemen, this is a case that's here on motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus in the matter of the Honorable Stephen Chandler, Judge of the Western District of Oklahoma against the Tenth Judicial Council of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.397" offset="360991">I will briefly state the facts in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.261" offset="376456">On December 13, 1965, the Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit entered a -- entered an order, held after a secret meeting at which Judge Chandler was not able to be present, and the order effectively stripped Judge Chandler of all of his powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.921" offset="463078">He was ordered not to hear any of the cases assigned to him, nor was he to be allowed to hear any further cases that would be filed in his Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.211" offset="504247">The other judges of his court were ordered to divide Judge Chan -- Judge Chandler's cases among themselves and to enter into a new order of business whereby none of the future cases filed in the court could be assigned to Judge Chandler.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.750" offset="622320">This order was signed by the members of the Judicial Council, not as members of Judicial Council but as circuit judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.780" offset="654503">It was filed in the Tenth Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.092" offset="671744">It was filed in the Western District Court and a Deputy Marshal was ordered to serve it on Judge Chandler.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.409" offset="729004">Well, sir, the order itself, the signators or the judges who signed it beneath their signators, they said Circuit Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.951" offset="759202">This point, Your Honor, I bring up because it does have some bearing upon the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.190" offset="784175">It does enter into that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.613" offset="793788">It does have to do with whether or not these judges were entertaining judicial powers or administrative powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.591" offset="821687">They were clothing about themselves the powers of the judicial offices, which they held when they signed the order, Circuit Judge, filed at the court and they got a Deputy Marshal to serve it.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.261" offset="952404">Section 332 of Title 28 provides that a meeting of the Judicial Council shall be called by the Chief Judge at least twice a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.057" offset="995558">I'm not convinced that the Chief Judge can't call a meeting of the circuit judges for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.062" offset="1019591">If another a judge calls a meeting, is it a proper meeting of the Judicial Council?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.379" offset="1040906">According to the statute, only the Chief Judge can call it.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.066" offset="1483630">It stated that after a review of the entire situation that Judge Chandler was either unable or unwilling to discharge efficiently the powers of his office, and that was why all of his cases were taken from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.298" offset="1576521">It is Exhibit A to the original motion for leave to file that was entered in this case, the first -- the first matter filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.862" offset="1634826">After the -- after the handing down of the order, we filed a motion for leave to file for a writ of mandamus in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.358" offset="1672756">We also made application for stay of the Judicial Council's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.909" offset="1695013">A few days later, there appeared, Solicitor General Marshall representing, the Judicial Council and he advised this Court that the order of the Judicial Council was intended to be temporary only, pending prompt further proceedings by the Judicial Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.674" offset="1770036">He stated that a hearing would be held, at which hearing, the Judicial Council would determine what powers to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.024" offset="1799502">Under three sections -- this is very interesting, Your Honors, it was cited not only Section 332, which provides administrative powers we believe for Judicial Councils, but Section 137 which provides a method whereby Judicial Councils can settle disputes among District Judges when they can't decide on how to assign new cases in their Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.215" offset="1888214">But Solicitor General Marshall mentioned that the Judicial Council wanted to consider what use of its power should be made under Section 372 (b), which as the members of this Court know a Section that bears upon the mental fitness of a federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.939" offset="1959163">In other words, he was suggesting to this Court that reason existed perhaps for the Judicial Council to certify to the President that Judge Chandler was permanently, mentally disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.747" offset="2006392">Solicitor General Marshall stated that the order had been issued only to keep Judge Chandler from filling his office while the conduct of his office was thus in question and he stated that the order was interlocutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.183" offset="2080057">That pending a full hearing into the fitness of Judge Chandler, and then the Solicitor General said that he had personally examined files in the Tenth Circuit and here in Washington that it was his conviction, conviction of the matter, warranted careful examination, that it was highly desirable to maintain the status quo and that public confidence in the Federal Judiciary would be inevitably impaired if Judge Chandler were to preside over his court while the question of his fitness to serve was under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.786" offset="2218506">Well, we can quite understand why this Court denied the application for stay, based upon this very strong language of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.518" offset="2265422">We can understand it, we -- it happened, anyway, the application for stay was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.481" offset="2293321">After that was denied, the Judicial Council then did issue a second order.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.373" offset="2320906">In our opinion, this order did not call for the type of hearing that had been represented to you, gentlemen, by the Judicial Council would be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.937" offset="2355075">Judge Chandler wasn't ordered to come to any hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.253" offset="2368345">He was notified that a hearing would be held and that if he wanted to appear, he might, and that he could present to the hearing such matters as he deemed desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.371" offset="2408887">There was no indication of any charges against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.641" offset="2421948">He wasn't ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.392" offset="2424978">The county was told he could bring counsel if he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.150" offset="2435950">Well, Judge Chandler advised both this Court and the Judicial Council that he would not attend such a hearing, that he challenged their jurisdiction to remove cases from him and upon that, the Judicial Council then decided that it would hold a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.079" offset="5051643">It certainly is in assistance of the judges of the court in their carrying out their judicial functions and I think that when a Judicial Council acts to remove from a judge all of his power to hear and decide cases that now, we have the strongest possible instance when someone is exercising judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.669" offset="5158013">Your Honor, the main thing is the -- is this Section 332 which set up Judicial Councils and what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.381" offset="5192913">And I want to direct this Court's attention to I think the most significant part of this case, and that is, what is the meaning of Section 332 and it is our contention that in 1948 when there was a revision of the Judicial Code that there were important changes made that slipped by the Congress in such a manner that congressional intent could not have been involved and that these changes cannot be the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.488" offset="5325302">The Committee Report in 1948 stated, and it was only eight pages long with a big appendix to -- of the reviser's notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.566" offset="5353618">The Committee Report said, “The reviser's notes are akin to the sections of the revision and explain in detail every change made in the past.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.646" offset="5393951">Now, that's the notice given to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.989" offset="5403355">The reviser's notes on Section 332 said, “Changes in phraseology were made,” there were two other remarks, but they don't bear upon this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.535" offset="5449540">Well, Your Honor, if you will compare the 1939 statute, which was the original one, and the 1948 statute, and I have these two statutes laid out side by side on page 13 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.761" offset="5510457">I think that you can see what violence was done to the 1939 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.581" offset="5537729">Now, the 1939 statute has cohesion and builds logically from first, the calling of council meetings to second, the submission to the meetings of the administrator of the U.S. Court Reports, next, to the taking of action thereon by the council, and finally, notice to the district judges of their duty to promptly carry out the directions of the Council as to the administration of business of their courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.262" offset="5652459">Your Honors, in the 1948 revised version, there's been a lot said about the fact that the word “order” was substituted for the word “directions,” that that's not the principal change that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.128" offset="5711914">The principal change made is that in the 1948 Act, the Judicial Council was given two sources of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.853" offset="5750784">In the 1939 Act, it was given a single source of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.995" offset="5771368">The 1948 Act in the third paragraph, continues as the 1939 Act did, talks about the quarterly reports of the administrator of the Courts and then says, “The Council shall take such action thereon as may be necessary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.847" offset="5830719">There is a source of power for Judicial Councils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.929" offset="5843048">Then it breaks a paragraph and it commences with the final paragraph, and it commences with a second source of power, which the 1939 Act didn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.691" offset="5878157">It says, “Each Judicial Council shall make all necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the Courts within its circuit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.977" offset="5923297">It's got two statements of authority; the 1939 Act had one and now, the sentence about the judges carrying into effect that directions or orders, I don't care what you call it, this Section is put at the bottom after the second source of power of Judicial Councils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.432" offset="6005112">Now, there's been a lot said about the powers of Judicial Councils being just about plenary, and I can see why because when this 1948 revision was made, there was slipped into this statute in the revis -- in the revising process, two sources of power for Judicial Councils, and that was not the intent in the 1939 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.655" offset="6641977">They did ask the question and I don't recall whether it was Chief Justice Groner or someone who -- I don't believe it was him as a matter of fact -- said in their opinion, there were sufficient teeth because if the Judicial Council made a direction that it would be carried out quite naturally and that no further words were needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.078" offset="6731734">I believe that that is the desolation of the 1939 discussion about were teeth needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.973" offset="6763290">I think that people may have been concerned at the time whether or not they could put additional teeth in there if it came to a point of taking a judge's cases away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.598" offset="6813759">Well, sir, Your Honor, the -- I think the history of the 1939 Act really is a history which shows that what was really intended to be done in 1939 was to set up an administrative procedure for the Courts to take away from the Attorney General the necessity of attending to these details.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.483" offset="6893275">They provided the administrator of the U.S. Court, a new office and they tied to the Judicial Council the preparation of these -- this data gathering and statistics compiling reports of the administrator of the courts and submitting these to the Councils and the Councils acting thereon, and then issuing directions to the judges who shall carry out the directions, in the words of the statute, as to the administration of the business of their respective courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.461" offset="7017200">I contend that the 1948 revision, because of the Committee Report, which is the true legislative history of any enactment, because of the reviser's notes, the changes in phraseology were made; that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.620" offset="7073834">I contend the original intention of 1939 controlled and that the two sources of authority for Judicial Councils to act now don't really change what the law is because that wasn't the intention of Congress, Congress didn't intend to change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.855" offset="7154813">Your Honor, I notice that the Judicial Conference in 1961 issued a report entitled “The Powers and Responsibilities of the Judicial Councils.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.065" offset="7195669">This was a very elaborate document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.669" offset="7206013">Someone got Chairman Celler to print it as a House document, and it's a fine and elaborate defense of the Judicial Councils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.668" offset="7234017">In fact, it even appears to me as its an attempt to take care of any weaknesses in the authority of Judicial Councils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.648" offset="7265991">This report immediately focuses on the Ninth -- the first thing it does is talk about the 1948 revision and particularly, the change of word of “directions” to “orders.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.842" offset="7310712">Now, that's strengthening word but that isn't a significant thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.558" offset="7325654">Nevertheless, the Judicial Conference says, “The changes are one of form and emphasis rather than substance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.939" offset="7359091">No change in substance has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.464" offset="7373197">That was the conclusion of the Judicial Conference in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.573" offset="7389706">It's important that that document makes no mention of the fact that the 1948 statute carries two sources of powers for the Judicial Council whereby the 1939 Act only carried one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.323" offset="7448639">I submit the -- there's been no change in the -- any intention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.735" offset="7474343">Your Honor, I think that -- I think that there's another issue involved in this case, and that is that taking all the cases from a judge, all the cases, is tantamount to impeachment and I think there's a very serious question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.194" offset="7552188">The Constitution gave the impeachment powers to the House and to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.962" offset="7575176">The Senate shall have the sole power to impeach this -- I mean the House -- the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.833" offset="7610702">I think the history of the Constitution shows that there was no intention to provide any other means for removing a federal judge from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.266" offset="7656469">Federal judges were given their offices during good behavior and yet the federalist in its number 78 and 79, devotes itself to proving how important judicial independence is to the rights and liberties of the people, and how the Constitution secures that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.842" offset="7726791">It talks about then about the impeachment powers of the House and Senate and says, “This is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial carrier.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2782.737" offset="11234304">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.792" offset="11258546">In view of the lineup in which presentations will be made in our time situation, I would like to anticipate some of the argument that the Solicitor General has included in his brief and some of the arguments which are presented by Professor Wright in his brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.025" offset="11339421">I think that in considering the matter, the Court necessarily must bear in mind the long history involving good behavior and the impeachment Sections of the Federal Constitution and major Section 332 of the statute and the action of the Judicial Council in this specific case against that long history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.018" offset="11447463">A part of these two briefs to which I refer address themselves to that problem, to the history and we all know that from the time that John Randolph in 1787 made his original resolutions respecting a national judiciary in the Continental Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.101" offset="11507754">And when Mr. Dickinson moved that the good behavior provision should be modified to follow the British pattern that where a -- and address by the Congress and the Senate to the President might result in the removal of a federal judge, that this was rejected in favor of the independence of the Federal Judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.802" offset="11594585">We'd recall that Thomas Jefferson of course strongly supported the idea of total independence, except for impeachment and then, a few years later, we find that he was criticizing the impeachment procedures as not being adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.445" offset="11649128">And against that background, we have to look at what's happened in this specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.922" offset="11675042">It can only be characterized as outrageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.254" offset="11684342">There is a chief judge at federal district court who served with honor, with honesty, with efficiency for 26 years, who's been chief judge for 8 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.423" offset="11733034">We know from public documents that are a matter of public record in which in our brief, we've asked this Court to take judicial notice of and which it properly can take judicial notice of -- and which it should take judicial notice of that there's been a long friction in terms of jurisdiction between what the Tenth Judicial Circuit thought it could do honestly, I suppose, in terms of Section 332 and Section 137, Section 372, perhaps Section 371 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.645" offset="11865945">And this -- a friction has manifested itself ultimately in the final order of the Judicial Council which was not its first order against this judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.748" offset="11918399">In the Solicitor General's brief, there are references to the Occidental Petroleum case and to the Texaco case that referred to the Judicial Council's order, not by name, but simply saying that the judge has been involved in criminal and civil litigation which has had some impact that speak of his attitude and his conduct and the efficiency of the Court without any factual showing as to how these relate in any manner to the difficulties any federal judge has over many years in dealing with complicated cases and complicated litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.996" offset="12055385">The first question which concerns me against this historical background is the -- the threshold question, as the Solicitor General calls it, of whether this Court has jurisdiction, and which some of the justices have raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.586" offset="12109720">Our position is that the Court does have jurisdiction under Section 1651 of Title 28, that being the All Writs Act, which incorporates as we understand it and as we understand, the Solicitor General understands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.695" offset="12174190">It incorporates the old Sections 13 and 14 of the original Judiciary Act of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.095" offset="12207731">And although Judge McGruder and I guess the Josephson case perhaps it suggested that there had been some change by reason of the revision of these older sections into the present Section 1651, the All Writs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.638" offset="12261961">We agree with the Solicitor General that this Court has jurisdiction by reason of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.889" offset="12290905">A second point I think I would touch on briefly is that in our brief, we suggested that the Court had inherent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.439" offset="12321102">And we also mentioned that it would have power under the due process proceed -- provisions of the Constitution to deal with the matter of this extraordinary significance, in this context, in this historical context, and in -- and then the practical immediate context because here, these are live judges operating a very important circuit of where we've had a long running situation that's resulted in an interference by somebody with the operation of that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.609" offset="12425801">Our position is the Tenth Judicial Council has unconstitutionally not impeached the judge and removed the judge from the office, but they've removed the office from the judge in a kind of reverse English procedure which certainly Congress could not possibly have intended because it would be unconstitutional in our judgment on the face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.836" offset="12502706">The provisions of the Federal Constitution relating to this matter are so explicit in setting up a special court in the Senate that requires a two-thirds vote where everybody's on oath and it names who the chief justice and providing officers shall be, and exactly what the procedure shall be in the judicial proceeding to convict somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.253" offset="12572400">And all of these things we think come within the type of problem, which is contemplated, can be reached under Section 1651 under the extraordinary writs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.380" offset="12616913">These are the kind of extraordinary circumstances, the actual Judicial Council here that -- that energize and bring the Section 1651 into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.342" offset="12652753">Now, the inherent powers, we didn't just make up the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.686" offset="12670098">This Tenth Judicial Council and at least three of the cases cited in Solicitor General's brief, and I say the Solicitor General's brief does not touch on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.860" offset="12698833">It makes reference to the fact they never heard of this Court suggesting it had inherent powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.506" offset="12721403">But in the Ritter case cited in the Solicitor General's brief and the Texaco Case and the Occidental Petroleum Case, all three, the court there the Tenth Circuit said, “We're exercising our power under Section 1651 or our inherent appellate jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.530" offset="12781484">They didn't care which, and they specifically stated it in all three cases, and that's how they acted to -- to issue extraordinary writs against Judge Chandler in these specific cases, which lie at the base of the existing order which we challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.769" offset="12854418">Now, the second problem that seems to me that we're concerned with is the Solicitor General, and putting aside Professor Wright's position, that this Court has no jurisdiction, we follow the Solicitor General on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.593" offset="12897782">We think it does, for the reasons he addresses himself to and the reasons I have set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.167" offset="12920038">The second problem is whether or not, and as I understand the Solicitor General's brief, he says, “Either the case is moot or Judge Chandler is estopped from being here because he has agreed to the present division of business in his Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.483" offset="12985344">On the question of agreement, we have cited in our brief that this was a kind of a -- this was not the kind of a -- of an agreement that can lead to estoppel, just as it was not the kind of disagreement that would energize Section 137 of Title 28, that is the -- it would energize or activate the statutory authority whereby the Tenth Judicial Council could divide the business of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.464" offset="13081266">And on that point, let me say I would not agree that an exercise of Section 137 so extreme that it deprived the judge of all his cases was a constitutional exercise of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.943" offset="13131107">I think 137 has to be measured against what they're trying to do, and it cannot be used to deprive a judge of his office any more than Section 332 can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.683" offset="13170082">It can be used when it's activated properly by a genuine and bona fide disagreement to divide the business of the Court so we can get on with the judicial business of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.949" offset="13211146">Now, with respect to whether or not that first order, the order we challenge, was moot, I simply call the Court's attention to the Grant case we cite and to this Court's more recent case in the American Phosphate Exporters case, which was decided last November which addresses itself to this problem of mootness and I just have a -- just a word --</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.667" offset="13506017">This matter came before this Court on the Tenth Judicial Council's original order of December 13, 1965 where they said, and I quote directly from the order, “In the past four years, the Judicial Council at many meetings has discussed and considered the business of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and has done so with particular regard to the effect thereon of the attitude and conduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.658" offset="13606013">So these are not words in any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.793" offset="13614582">They made them up, and they could make up a lot more and any Judicial Council could at this Court authorize this kind of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3657.892" offset="14734921">If the Court please, a very -- another very important question which has come up is -- the Solicitor General I'm sure will address himself to is whether or not Judge Chandler has agreed to the present division of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.090" offset="14787688">And that by this agreement, he's -- although the Solicitor General doesn't knew that he use the term that he's estopped, whether or not by this agreement, it makes the case moot or removes any colors for this Court to get into what the Solicitor General calls the delicate question, Constitutional questions involved in Section 332.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.148" offset="14867937">We've pointed out in our brief that Judge Chandler's agreement was not a bona fide agreement in the sense that the law would contemplate it that it should be to a estopping from complaining about something to which he had agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.390" offset="14928959">His agreement was simply, he put right in the letter that he was signing under protest to avoid creating a disagreement and that he would expect to address himself to the constitutionality of the action of the Tenth Judicial Council, as outlined in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.279" offset="15000534">I see that my time has come out, and I'll just close on saying this, that I -- we agree with Congressman Celler and other scholars who have said that good behavior, attitude, conduct in these matters are not just issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.183" offset="15052152">They're not questions that can be tried in any place except in the Senate of the United States acting as a Court of impeachment in accordance with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.279" offset="15084440">And therefore, we would say this Court, in order to clarify the matter, not to avoid what's the delicate problem but to solve what's been 150 years of a complicated problem should speak forthrightly and completely and totally so that the federal judges will know, the Judicial Councils will know exactly where their authority begins and ends under Section 137 and under Section 332, because if this Court says it doesn't have jurisdiction and steps away from this case, it will compound what is a very serious situation which will continue in all the Judicial Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.505" offset="15197393">Some of them may run wild.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.764" offset="15202408">We don't know what will happen, but certainly, these are human beings with the same personality frailties that have given rise to this case and brought all of us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.674" offset="15234069">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3789.106" offset="15259773">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please in my submission, the part of this case was in the question that Mr. Justice Stewart put to Mr. Kenan when he said, “Would you agree that if the action of the Judicial Council was administrative in nature that this Court is entirely without jurisdiction to review the matter?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.834" offset="15338663">And Mr. Kenan answered that question in the affirmative, an answer that I think is compelled by a line of authority going back to Marbury v. Madison, that unless the proceeding that is brought here is a judicial action by an inferior tribunal, but then this Court is being asked to exercise original jurisdiction and that it may do only in cases to which states were parties or ambassadors or consuls are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.619" offset="15457886">Mr. Kenan having agreed with the basic premise then suggested that in this particular instance, the Judicial Council acted in a judicial fashion, an argument that I must confess I have some difficulty in following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.005" offset="15531342">His view as I understand it is that Congress intended to create an administrative agency called the Judicial Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.211" offset="15572198">I agree entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.717" offset="15578258">It seems that legislative history is clear, that literature is all in one direction on this that no one, so far as prior to the Solicitor General's brief in this case, has ever suggested that a Judicial Council is vested with any part of the judicial power of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.453" offset="15665194">That it has always been understood to be merely an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.085" offset="15683688">Justices Black and Douglas when this case was here before referred to it as a governmental agency with limited administrative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.079" offset="15715662">Now, I agree entirely with this characterization of the Judicial Council.</text>

            <text syncTime="5373.795" offset="21598542">A true -- [Laughter] A true friend of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.093" offset="21623724">The first question to which I will address myself is this Court's jurisdiction of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.975" offset="21663222">It is plain of course that the Court has jurisdiction only as an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, that this case is here as an original matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.563" offset="21709615">It is obvious that neither the United States nor a state nor a foreign minister or ambassador is a party and there is no basis for original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.714" offset="21762278">I may say that when I started consideration of this case, I had the tentative view that there was no jurisdiction here, that this was not an exercise of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.679" offset="21818075">That indeed, the argument presented by Professor Wright was the sound analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.194" offset="21856110">I learned my federal jurisdiction from Professor Frankfurter and I tend to take a rather strict view of these matters and also to regard them as important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.191" offset="21920162">But after my associate, who I regret has now left the government service, Mr. Lacovara, presented me an elaborate memorandum on the matter and I discussed it with him at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.311" offset="21988603">I came to the conclusion that that was probably wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.937" offset="22007097">I would like to make it plain that I do not regard this as by any means a matter of black and white.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.408" offset="22036982">It will be clearer after this Court has decided it and it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.642" offset="22065925">But it does not help it seems to me to say that this is administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.497" offset="22109393">That is an example of the tyranny of words because if this is a judicial administration, it may present a situation which is different than anything with which the Court has previously dealt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.994" offset="22191313">It is of course clear and accepted in many fields that it is a Constitution we are dealing with and that the understanding of the Constitution grows and develops with the development of problems, and the approach is to problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.622" offset="22285876">It was probably true at an earlier time that we had a very small conception of judicial administration of the function and responsibility of courts in seeing to it that their business is soundly and effectively handled, in addition to the process of the actual decision of the case in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.300" offset="22396531">Over the past generation, there's been a great expansion in the awareness of the importance of the function of the judicial administration, and we have people like Chief Justice Hughes and Chief Justice Groner and Judge Parker and Arthur Vanderbilt and others who were largely responsible for the development of the statutory provisions which now exist, establishing not only the Judicial Conference of the United States which is not involved here in any way whatever, but also the Judicial Councils.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.322" offset="22584613">Now, the Judicial Council, it is perfectly plain or simply the Courts of Appeals sitting en banc.</text>

            <text syncTime="5943.356" offset="23876838">And I could simply provide him the statute that the Court sitting en banc could be convened by the chief judge for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.216" offset="23928247">It still seems to me that what the court is doing -- what the Judicial Council is doing here is exercising what has come to be recognized not only as judicial power but as an important judicial responsibility to see that the judicial business of the circuit is effectively and expeditiously administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.514" offset="24069413">This was not an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="5994.004" offset="24079339">It was not an arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.890" offset="24098983">It grew out of such experiences as those which Chief Justice Taft lived through in the 1920s when there was no such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.149" offset="24151960">And I just happened on a letter written by Chief Justice Taft in the 1920s in Alpheus Mason's biography of Taft.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.723" offset="24206294">He wrote a letter to a district judge who had not disposed of a case which had been pending before him for four years and he felt that he had to put into that letter the following, and think of this from an ex-president and chief justice of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6044.798" offset="24282572">“Of course, I write this letter with no assumption that I may exercise direct authority over you in the discharge of your duties, but as head of the federal judiciary, I feel I do have to appeal to you in its interest and in the interest of the public whom it is created to serve to end this indefinite situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.148" offset="24372015">And the objective, the intended objective was to provide a judicial authority within the judiciary, nobody outside, no executive authority, no legislative authority, but the courts were to run their own house or to do it without interference and their representative said that, “Give us the chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6091.378" offset="24468877">Give us that power and we will take care of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.162" offset="24484028">Now, it is also clear that they contemplated that it would be -- that it would very rarely be necessary to do anything to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.012" offset="24527391">These are high level people and if it became necessary for the Judicial Council to issue an order, the odds were very strong that it would be complied with however reluctantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.008" offset="24599385">But the statute does expressly give the Judicial Council, which I repeat is the Court of Appeals sitting en banc by another name.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.635" offset="24649958">It does give them expressly authority to make those orders and it provides that it shall be the duty of the District Judges to carry them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.380" offset="24692903">Such an order was issued in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.745" offset="24706382">I have no doubt that the constitutional requirement of case or controversy is met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6162.894" offset="24754970">Chief Judge Chandler sought leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition to review the validity of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.333" offset="24808678">And though as I've said, it is not fully clear, it does seem to me that that was a judicial order entered by a judicial body in carrying out judicial responsibility and that the review of that order before this Court is an exercise of appellate and not original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.661" offset="24954023">Now, I would turn to the question on the merits where I do agree with Professor Wright's position in representation of the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.781" offset="25030510">In the first place, the only paper before this Court, the only pleading before this Court is Judge Chandler's petition or motion for leave to file and petition for a writ or mandamus, which was filed in January 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.762" offset="25118386">And in that petition, he prays that a writ or prohibition or a mandamus be issued to restrain the respondent from exceeding its jurisdictional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.378" offset="25168854">In ordering that until its further order, the petitioner shall take no action whatsoever in any case or proceeding now or hereafter pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and that order no longer exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.717" offset="25246281">It was completely superseded on February 4, 1966 in the document which is marked F in the return or response, which has been filed by the Tenth Circuit Judicial Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.999" offset="25331336">And as far as the record is concerned, since that date, there has been no dispute, no controversy between the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council and Judge Chandler.</text>
            <text syncTime="6322.084" offset="25391731">Now, I think that that can most clearly be shown by examining the item, which is item K in the return of the Tenth Circuit, which is a letter on the stationery of Judge Chandler signed by all five judges of the Western District of Oklahoma, leading off with Stephen J. Chandler as the first signature addressed to the Tenth Circuit Judicial Conference in response to the letter of the Honorable Davis T. Lewis to the active judges of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="6368.619" offset="25577827">In the minutes of the meeting of the Judicial Council attached thereto, “We advise that the current order for the division of business in this district is agreeable under the circumstances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6381.938" offset="25631117">Now Judge Chandler makes a lot out of that “under the circumstances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6387.382" offset="25652851">He refers to the fact that his previous letter in February 1966 by which he joined with the other judges in agreement as to the division of the business was under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.453" offset="25717217">He says that this is under duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.217" offset="25728188">However, it seems to me clear that Judge Chandler cannot have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.289" offset="25752534">He cannot either consent and not consent at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6418.202" offset="25776149">By this letter, he has consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.103" offset="25787747">There is thus no dispute between him and the Tenth Circuit Judicial Conference.</text>

            <text syncTime="6634.523" offset="26641429">It's the -- it is the statutory responsibility of the Courts of Appeals sitting en banc and thereby being known as the Judicial Councils to make appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious handling of the business of the District Courts and a situation where all of the district judges in a district fail to meet their responsibilities would clearly be a situation calling for the exercise of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6673.478" offset="26797328">Now, various things have been said about the order which was entered by the Judicial Council in December of 1965 that it was done without a hearing and without notice and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.626" offset="26889906">In our brief, we indicate that we think that as of that time, it may have been difficult to support that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6711.255" offset="26948420">It was quickly explained as having been interlocutory and I can conceive of situations where it would be appropriate for the Judicial Council to take action of this sort without a hearing and indeed without notice just as courts repeatedly grant temporary restraining orders on ex parte applications because something has to be done quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.351" offset="27052805">I can imagine a situation where a judge should go on stark raving mad and something had to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6746.904" offset="27090944">I can imagine situations where it would be entirely appropriate for the Judicial Council to order that no further cases be assigned to a judge and that he not sit on any pending cases presumably after a notice and a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.275" offset="27160430">For example, if a judge were indicted for having accepted bribes in connection with his handling of the cases and he announced, “Well, who cares about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.230" offset="27208286">I'll be in Court Monday, you can go ahead.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6779.313" offset="27220616">I can imagine that it would be appropriate for the Judicial Council to issue an order such as was issued here or even stronger than was issued here, providing that he should no longer -- should not sit on pending matters and should have no new matters assigned to him until the indictment had been disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.807" offset="27310582">Now, that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6805.379" offset="27324897">In this case, it is my own view that the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council did not act with the proper procedures, but on February 4, 1966, that order was completely superseded, it is no longer in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.684" offset="27414131">I don't think the antitrust case of last year has any real application to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6833.614" offset="27437850">There is no -- there is no threat or risk that the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council will do further acts which would be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6847.190" offset="27492080">Since February 4, 1966, the only order that has been outstanding has been one which is in entire accord with the position of Judge Chandler.</text>
            <text syncTime="6858.886" offset="27538892">Item one, Judge Chandler has agreed with the judges of the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma that no new business will be assigned to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.412" offset="27581001">And item two, all pending cases before Judge Chandler are left to him without interference in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6877.938" offset="27615169">He thus has exactly what he asks for currently.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.200" offset="27632201">If he thinks that isn't all that he wants, he can change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6887.767" offset="27654457">With respect to pending cases that may soon be cleared out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6893.281" offset="27676505">With respect to future cases, all he has to do is to tell his fellow district judges that he doesn't agree and that he wants some cases assigned to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.796" offset="27718510">If his fellow judges do agree to assign cases to him and he accepts that, there will be no disagreement and there will be no basis for the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council to act under Section 137.</text>
            <text syncTime="6916.815" offset="27770650">If on the other hand his fellow district judges do not agree, then there will be a disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.637" offset="27793951">It will be appropriate for the Tenth Circuit to take whatever action may be appropriate under the circumstances, and I have no idea what that action would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6933.287" offset="27836479">Thus, I submit for the Court's consideration that although it is novel that this is a case within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States, but that the motion for leave to file the petition for a writ of mandamus should be denied because there is no longer any existing controversy outstanding.</text>
