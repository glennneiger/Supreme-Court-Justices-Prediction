            <text syncTime="14.930" offset="163088">This case presents a serious question, here in Oestereich against the Selective Service Board, but not decided in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.567" offset="193599">Of whether the selective service system is being used to punish or sanction this ancient behavior without due process, without congressional authorization and on the standards so vague and broad as to offend the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.160" offset="248038">There is in addition here, two serious questions, there are here two serious questions, concerning criminal procedure in the 9.7% of all federal criminal prosecutions, which are represented by selective service prosecutions today.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.218" offset="436224">Eight days later, on the 24th of October, 1967, General Hershey, the Director of the Selective Service System, issued the letter to all local boards and local board memorandum number 85, which are reprinted in Appendix B to the petitioner's brief which was an issue in Oestereich.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.384" offset="620857">Those figures are collected most recently in the Marshall Commission report in pursuit of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.153" offset="655966">The local board memorandum and letter, urged local boards to use the delinquency power to reclassify and order for priority induction, registrants who engaged in illegal demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.396" offset="708942">As soon as it could under the regulations, the petitioner's board on December 21, 1967, sent him a delinquency notice, reprinted at page 44 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.836" offset="750738">And a weekend, a day and Christmas day after that, sent him an order to report for priority induction.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.955" offset="939238">The delinquency regulations, if the Court please, provide that when a registrant fails to perform any duty, a term given no further definition, under the act or regulations, he may in the unfettered discretion of the board be declared delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.172" offset="1000051">If he is to further exempt, he may again in the unfettered discretion of the board be classified in the class available for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.348" offset="1028786">If he's already 1-A, he is sent to the head of the list for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.369" offset="1048848">Now, if he is reclassified out of the deferred or exempt status, he has a personal appearance before the board and an appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.891" offset="1126902">The decision to declare, retain, or remit delinquency status, resides under the regulations in the discretion of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.379" offset="1176848">It's our contention, set forth in our brief, that this kind of administrative sanctioning procedure, involving the summary deprival of a benefit or privilege, under a regulatory system, knows no parallel in federal administrative law today.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.295" offset="1252603">And when coupled with administration under the broad ranging directive of the director of Selective Service to have local boards reach out to get at the sanctioned behavior, the regulations have a fearsome deterrent effect upon the exercise of protected freedoms.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.247" offset="1320312">How much of your case depends upon whether he did or did not have a right to a hearing at that time?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="312.987" offset="1355316">Mr. Chief Justice, I would say our case depends not at all upon that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.299" offset="1376528">We do of course contend that the regulations impose punishment and therefore, he was entitled to a judicial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.996" offset="1399306">Second, that they impose a sanction at least and he is entitled to due process and adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.399" offset="1425011">But, even if the Court should decide those questions against us, we believe that Green and McElroy compels reversal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.580" offset="1453641">Green and McElroy will be recalled, did not require the Court to reach the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.480" offset="1473285">All the Court held was that given our presumption in favor of fairness, we would not presume that the Congress authorized an administrative agency to dispense with these fundamental procedural decencies, without an expressed statement by the Congress and an expressed statement by the president of an intention to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.518" offset="1561475">And if the Court were to adapt that position, which seems to me sensible and supported by the former decisions of the Court, the constitutional issue need not be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.428" offset="1605047">However, we do believe that if the constitutional issue must be reached, should be decided in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.369" offset="1628871">These regulations in their purpose, their language, their administration, and their effect are punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.044" offset="1663561">Even the Government cannot evade this issue and it's brief that a search on the one hand that they are not punitive and in the appendix to its brief reprints a letter from General Hershey to Mendel Rivers, which makes their punitive intent abundantly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.959" offset="1719254">On page 81, General Hershey says that Selective Service should not be used for punitive purposes, if by that it's meant that one should be inducted to the Armed Forces as punishment for an offense, which is not related to Selective Service, leaving the regulations to be applied in that vast number of federal offenses which maybe found in trusteeses of the Selective Service Act and Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.508" offset="1841403">Indeed, the delinquency regulations are far broader than is necessary to achieve the limited, non punitive purpose which the Government would describe to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.465" offset="1889259">Under the regulations, a registrant is presumed to be 1-A, unless he supplies the board with information about his status.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.345" offset="1912769">And perhaps, properly so that compels him to go in there, and tell the local board what he's been doing and whether he's entitled to a deferment or exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.165" offset="1947982">A delinquency system, which limits the local board discretion, and which provided that a registrant's classification was to be frozen, it was to be frozen in 1-A for example, and that no requests for deferment would be considered, until he started cooperating with the local board in supplying information.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.985" offset="2019349">If again, placed under a limited, non discretionary, regulatory scheme, might be non-punitive, but taking the further step of prior to induction illustrates I think the punitive purpose, which lies at the base of these regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.990" offset="2159365">I think that this regulatory scheme finds no authorization, whatever in the Selective Service Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.102" offset="2183816">And that it ought to be held unauthorized and the president left, if he wishes to, to -- excuse me, I misunderstood your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.733" offset="2230314">If the regulations were redrafted with the limitation I've just suggested, perhaps this Court could find them approved under the statute or authorized under the president's general rule making power.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.041" offset="2311502">The presence scheme reposing in local boards, there's absolute discretion, finds no authorization in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.996" offset="2339401">And, there is no indication that the Congress has ever explicitly and carefully considered it, as it has explicitly and carefully considered every other federal regulatory scheme that I know of, which involves the imposition of the sanction of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.616" offset="2445876">We turn therefore, to the inhibitory effect of the Hershey directive, upon the exercise of protective freedoms.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.009" offset="2491434">The letter Mr. Justice Black, it appears at page 81 of the Government's brief, it is a response to a letter from -- or to a request from Mendel Rivers for information.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.359" offset="2548799">The Government has attempted to evade the free speech issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.938" offset="2575130">In its brief and in oral argument yesterday, by denying that it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.834" offset="2602715">It underscores this by saying that the petitioner's turning in of his card is not protected conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.008" offset="2627375">We argue in our brief that it is, but the Court needn't reach that issue, in order to find the First Amendment fault in the Hershey directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.708" offset="2666245">The record in this case indicates that the board had before it, the following information. First, a letter from the United States Attorney, reprinted at page 42 and 43 of the appendix, stating that the petitioner had participated in an antiwar, anti-draft demonstration and turn in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.150" offset="2751927">Second, the board had before it the indubitably persuasive words of General Hershey counseling it to use its broad-ranging discretionary powers to punish behavior which the five lay members of the board conceived to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.696" offset="2818173">And finally, there is the delinquency notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.954" offset="2831235">We have here a case therefore, in which the directive, the regulatory scheme, the Hershey directive, the local board memorandum supplemented by this very vague system of procedural provisions in the delinquency regulations is unconstitutional on it's face.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.204" offset="2908139">And here, as in NAACP and Button, as in Freidman and Maryland, as in Aptheker against the Secretary of State, it doesn't matter whether the petitioner's conduct could be reached and punished under a more narrowly drawn regulatory and statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.378" offset="2976893">The directive being unconstitutional on it's face.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.050" offset="2995597">The regulations supplementing this chilling effect by their vagueness and the discretion they vest in local boards, requires a reversal of the petitioner's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.279" offset="3040528">This reading is indeed supported by the only prior selective service decision of this Court, which is in point, Sicurella against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.377" offset="3080861">In Sicurella, the local board had before it, the illegal recommendation by the Department of Justice, that the petitioner's conscientious objector claim be not sustained and the Court held that given this -- the presence of this persuasive though mistaken recommendation, that the conviction had to be reversed because it did not affirmatively appear in the selective service file, that the board had disavowed the unlawful and mistaken views of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.743" offset="3254314">The final point to which I would address myself in oral argument today, leaving the remainder of rather technical arguments to our very lengthy brief is the variance question.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.671" offset="3314082">That is the petitioner was indicted, if the Court for refusal to report for and submit to induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.729" offset="3346265">In a part of our brief and I don't propose to argue, we say that that indictment fails to state in offense, because it's bad under rule seven of the rules of criminal procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.007" offset="3623372">And the failure to perform that duty can be prosecuted under Section 12 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="884.271" offset="3640508">We have here therefore a case that is on all force with Stirone against United States, in which the indictment charged a conspiracy respecting the importation of sand into Pennsylvania and the proof at trial showed a conspiracy involving both the importation of sand and the exportation of steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.193" offset="3724100">In other words, the proof of trial was quite different from the offense with which the petitioner was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.108" offset="3759835">And, I would say that that is a not inconsiderable problem, given the large number of these offenses that are being prosecuted in the Courts, it devolves upon the Government with a special burden, I think to plead with accuracy and above all to present to the grand jury all of the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.979" offset="8935320">Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't think that we can look at a discretionary grant assuming that is going to be abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.476" offset="8969279">Obviously, with over four thousand draft boards in this country, there are abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.366" offset="8988818">I would not stand here and say they weren't, but where abuses are found, where abuses of that discretionary grant to the board are found, there is a process by which those abuses can be set right and I think just as any administrative board is given a discretion, where that discretion is abused, the person who is wrong has a power and a right to raise that wrong in the Court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.662" offset="9090069">And if it comes to the attention of those who are meant to enforce the law, then this is the way it works in any case, that the Attorney General would be the last one to admit the abuse of discretion or the Solicitor General in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.337" offset="9148688">I don't see that that's any difference, in terms of a grant of discretion to the draft boards and it is to any other administrative agency.</text>

            <label>Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus</label>
            <text syncTime="2324.520" offset="9401448">Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, this is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.215" offset="9412211">This is our position that this is clearly what is intended by the regulations themselves, when they say that the classification maybe reopened at anytime, without regard to other regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.131" offset="9463933">That he has the right, when he's reclassified to notice that he has a right to a hearing and he has the right to an appeal to the state appeal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.417" offset="9497057">That the -- that these regulations read as a whole clearly draw the analogy between civil contempt that we have drawn and make then remedial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.768" offset="9542405">The question of punishment that Mr. Justice Marshall addressed himself to yesterday, I think is very much involved in this case as to whether the delinquency regulations themselves amount to punishment, the acceleration and that if it does amount to punishment, is it done so without due process or the Fifth and Sixth Amendment guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.446" offset="9633207">Now, yesterday when I just mentioned in passing your question Mr. Justice Marshall, about what the punishment -- the question that bothered you that there maybe elements of punishment in the delinquency regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.561" offset="9685661">The counsel jumped with glee in his rebuttal argument that I was willing to admit there maybe elements of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.620" offset="9717844">I think that really it would do this Court a little good to get into so many called argument of just exactly what amounts to punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.280" offset="9748459">It is our position on page 39 and following of our brief that some of the indicia of legal punishment are present here, just as they were -- the outlined in the Kennedy Mendoza case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.156" offset="9811989">Among those indicia that are outline of that case is their sanctions that are here, ultimately involved an affirmative disability.He is going to be restrained, if he's in the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.613" offset="9853785">Secondly, it comes in to play on finding of scienter, this is in line with our theory that there has to be a willful violation of the regulations and a willful refusal to come back into compliance for the regulations, before the board has properly exercised this discretion in declaring some one delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.960" offset="9931212">Thirdly, the behavior to which it applies is already a crime and this is true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.043" offset="9951587">It is already a crime of the violation to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.527" offset="9965484">Does it promote one of the traditional aims of punishment, in deterrence and retribution, which were named in the Kennedy-Mendoza case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.441" offset="9997145">Now, I think that while there are some questions about the deterrence as being only used and only defined in terms of punishment that there are deterrent aspects of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.395" offset="10040926">But, there are indicia that do not point to punishment, as outlined in the Kennedy-Mendoza.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.091" offset="10067780">Induction is not historically been regarded as punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.223" offset="10088260">Secondly, whether there's an alternative purpose maybe assigned, a non penal purpose assigned into the regulations involved. And I think delinquency regulations do have an alternative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.658" offset="10141968">The purpose of the regulations is essentially two fold, is to induce cooperation with the Selective Service System on the part of all draft eligible men and this is where the civil contempt analogy comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.137" offset="10199960">Because if we're trying to define this in a remedial sense, that we're trying to get cooperation here, just as in a civil contempt proceeding if somebody comes back into compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.288" offset="10248547">And if he does what the regulations say, then he will be put back into his prior classification, otherwise there would be an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.548" offset="10285537">And in this case, the purpose of the regulations is to cure what has happened and not to punish what has happened and just as in the Troutman case, we have confessed there and I think we would be willing to do so in any instance in this Court or in any Court, where it was shown that an effort was made to cure the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.286" offset="10364531">The second purpose -- which is a non penal purpose, is the maintenance of the non delinquent morale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.777" offset="10394520">Those who do comply with the regulations, it should not, it seems to me be discouraged by the success of those who do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.435" offset="10429106">And for this reason, I think there is a good purpose of the -- alternative purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.120" offset="10459826">But as I said at the beginning, I think to get into an argument in this Court about whether this amounted to legal punishment might really cause the Court to miss the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.655" offset="10509981">Because the point in this case is why are we talking about punishment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.744" offset="10526386">We're talking about punishment, in terms of the delinquency regulations to find whether he has been deprived of due process or is stiff in Sixth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.910" offset="10567032">And what is in this case the punishment of which Mr. Gutknecht the petitioner complains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.141" offset="10587930">It is accelerated induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.979" offset="10599320">This is what he complaints of and before he can be inducted in an accelerated manner, he has the right to refuse induction, just as he did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.104" offset="10635786">And thereby, submit himself to a criminal prosecution in which he has the full panoply of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.241" offset="10668387">And, I think this is a clear distinction between this case and the case in Mendoza-Martinez, where the Court went in to the admittedly difficult question of what amounts to punishment and what doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.482" offset="10713318">Because Mr. Mendoza was never given a hearing, he was denationalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.017" offset="10731395">He left the country, in order to avoid the grant and having left, he was immediately denationalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.078" offset="10755636">He had no right to a hearing, to contest their denationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.557" offset="10769638">There was no way he could bring up a contesting of his rights and the Court there said that that was punishment and without the due process or Fourth or Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights which he should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.618" offset="10829824">I think we can draw an analogy between what has happened here and a grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.740" offset="10850304">Now, when a man is indicted under a grand jury proceeding, he is in a very real sense punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.250" offset="10876322">He maybe put in jail if he is indicted and without bail, if it's a non-bailable offense or bail maybe set so high that he can't meet it, and he stayed there. He has had none of his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights and probably a little due process at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.310" offset="10932642">But in this case, where the board itself has found him delinquent, because he's violated one of the regulations, I say the analogy between this and the grand jury is very close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.156" offset="10976005">And secondly, as far as the board hearing itself is concerned, he is given notice of the delinquency itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.018" offset="11007457">The notice that I read, they're right on page 44 of the appendix, where it says, “Come in, until let us tell you how we can show you how to avoid a further delinquency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.151" offset="11047999">In this case, he would have in my estimation, although it is contested by the petitioners, if he had asked for a hearing, he would have been given one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.046" offset="11083525">There's no evidence that he asked for a hearing in this case, because what was there to hear?</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.532" offset="11105468">He had turned in his draft card.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.896" offset="11114977">They're not going to hear whether he is willing to take them back or not, there is no fact situation for the board to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.005" offset="11139427">There is a clear regulation, which Mr. Gutknecht violated and under that regulation, it's within the discretion of the board to apply the delinquency regulations, which they did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.115" offset="11187806">Now, again under our theory, he would have the right to purge himself from this violation because I think had he shown a desire to do so and the board had refused to let him do it, we would have been the first to confess error, but he made no effort to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.132" offset="11243917">And in this case, I submit that there is no fact situation, which would have -- this Court could focus on, to say whether the procedural due process in the hearing at the board level has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.765" offset="11298461">Now, I submit that the Kennedy-Mendoza analysis is simply not sufficient in this case to determine that what we're talking about is legal punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.488" offset="11349347">I think there are some differences, but even if you find that the line between punishment and non punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.637" offset="11373902">If you find this false slightly over the line toward punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.463" offset="11389262">I think that even if that is true, he has been given at one stage, at the end of this process, all of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.627" offset="11425834">He has been given a complete due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.995" offset="11451329">This is the statutory framework that the Congress has setup whereby this man could raise his rights and there is no such statutory framework in the Kennedy-Mendoza situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.334" offset="11508694">Now, the other argument of the petitioner was in their brief that even if it wasn't punishment, we have not provided the procedural due process that is necessary and I think in pointing out that he did receive notice, it is our contention that a fair reading of the regulations would be that he could receive a hearing, if he so requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.940" offset="11591137">Now, this is a completely speculative question before this Court, because he didn't request to hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.223" offset="11612244">Either before he received the delinquency notice or after he received his reclassification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.503" offset="11637426">And I don't see how it can be heard to complain here, when he has not asked for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.942" offset="11663130">As far as the variance between the charge and the proof is concerned, I think that that is fairly stated in the brief and that I think that question, plus the argument that the affidavit itself, where indictment itself was duplicitous, boarders on the frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.089" offset="11735751">Now, there are cases cited in our brief, which I think clearly point out that the questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.016" offset="11763440">Yesterday, we discussed the problem of congressional authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.853" offset="11778800">And I think that in the broad sense, that the delinquency regulations are a fair grant to the administrative branch by Congress of an effort to implement what is admittedly a difficult statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.233" offset="11852257">To implement a selective service law in a time in this country in which many people are opposed to the results that might occur from going into the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.777" offset="11906487">But I think that given the policy as set down by the Congress in the executive branch, that this is a fair way of implementing that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.719" offset="11942222">And that this Court should affirm the Court below and uphold the delinquency regulations as adapted by the President.</text>
