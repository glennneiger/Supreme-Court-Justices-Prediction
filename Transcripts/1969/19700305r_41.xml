            <label>Mr. Lon Kile</label>
            <text syncTime="79.991" offset="423372">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.869" offset="446882">The circuit court's decision from which this appeal was taken had turned on that Court's construction of this Court's decision in United States versus Holt, United States versus Holt State Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.326" offset="512711">A review of the facts in United States versus Holt State Bank may of be of some help in the discussion of its application to the facts and the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.630" offset="577912">In United States versus Holt State Bank, Chippewas ceded to the United States their right of occupancy to a certain lands in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.573" offset="637680">In return, the United States agreed to put the land up for sale and when it was sold, put the money into a trust fund to be used for the benefits of Chippewas.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.148" offset="692015">Within the lands that the Chippewas ceded to the United States was a lake called Mud Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.244" offset="732348">Following the treaty with the Chippewas, Minnesota became a state and later Mud Lake was drained and its bed became valuable for agricultural purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.471" offset="793266">After Mud Lake was drained, the Government claimed that it was obligated to sell the bed of Mud Lake for the benefit of the Chippewas.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.166" offset="836002">The defendants claimed that upon its admittance to the union, Minnesota became the owner of the bed under the equal footing doctrine and that they have succeeded to the rights of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.259" offset="892426">The case presented two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.995" offset="903398">First, was the lake navigable and second, were the lands underlying the lake disposed of by the United States before Minnesota became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.816" offset="950627">Well, the Court first found that the lake was navigable and then it addressed itself to the question of whether the United States has its post of those lands before Minnesota became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.193" offset="1008097">Now it was not claimed in Holt State Bank that United States have made an affirmative disposition of the bed of the lake, but only this was the only claim that was made, that the lake was in the limits of a reservation when Minnesota was admitted to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.418" offset="1101093">Now, in it's analysis of the facts in that case, this Court said, “the reservation came in to being through a succession of treaties with the Chippewas whereby they ceded to the United States, their aboriginal right of occupancy to the surrounding lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.268" offset="1184475">There was no formal setting apart of what was not ceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.278" offset="1212479">The effect of what was done was to reserve in a general way for the continued occupation of the Indians, what remained of their aboriginal territory and thus it came to be known and recognized as a reservation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="297.754" offset="1294399">This Court in its decision in U.S. versus Holt State Bank referred to the equal footing doctrine and said, “First that disposals by the United States during territorial days is not likely to be inferred and should not be regarded as intended unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="324.188" offset="1400142">This Court found nothing in the cession of a right of occupancy in exchange for a promise that the land would be sold and the money used for the benefit of the Chippewas, rightfully so I think is even approaching a grant by the Government to the Indians of the underlying navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.000" offset="1491362">And this Court did not find anything in this cession of a right of occupancy in exchange for the creation of a trust fund that would evince a purpose to depart from the established policy of treating such lands as held for the benefit of a future state and we take no issue with this Court's decision in Holt State Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.420" offset="1609017">We believe that -- we believe that it's a good decision and it's a sound decision and one that should be allowed a stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.289" offset="1640573">But it must be remembered that in Holt State Bank, the Chippewas were the grantors and the United States was the grantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.093" offset="1703790">The Court said there was no formal setting apart of that which was not ceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.816" offset="1734614">What the Court is there saying is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.428" offset="1749034">The Chippewas were the grantors.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.760" offset="1762408">Had they wanted to keep the soil and the minerals, underlying Mud Lake, they should have set them apart from their cession.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.407" offset="1824998">But in the case at bar, the shoe fits on the other foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.707" offset="1854151">In the case now at bar, the United States was the grantor in the patent of the Cherokees of 1838 and it was the grantor in the patent to the Choctaws in 1842.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.890" offset="1922905">Applying the rule, enunciated in Holt State Bank, it must be said that had the United States in its patent to the Cherokees in 1838, its patent to the Choctaws in 1842, wanted to have reserve the soils and minerals underlying any portion of the Arkansas River, it should have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.775" offset="2042441">Now, it is said in Holt State Bank and we think that it is a sound rule that before a disposal of the bed of navigable waters by the United States can be inferred, its intent to do so should be made very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.376" offset="2140871">If it appears then in this case that when the Indians moved from their ancestral homes in the south to the wild lands in the west, it was both their intention and the intention of the United States that the lands to which they were being moved would never be embraced in the state or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.914" offset="2247032">If it appears from the negotiations leading up to the treaty, the language of the treaties themselves that it was the intention of the Indian tribes and the intention of the United States that the lands to which the Indians were being moved would never be embraced in a state or territory, then it is very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.213" offset="2388198">And the test established in Holt State Bank has been met, that the United States would have no reason to have retained the beds of the navigable streams in these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.098" offset="2447757">The absence of the necessity for retaining such a bed coupled with the urgency associated with moving the Indians out of the southern states, makes the intent of the United States to dispose of the beds of the navigable streams within those lands to which the Indians were then being moved, very plain.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.550" offset="3077622">I think the background of this case has been fully covered except I would like briefly refer to the so-called Louisiana Purchase of 1883.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.869" offset="3146898">There has been great weight placed upon that by the respondents in that their interpretation of that purchase is that it was purchased for the purpose of the formation of future states and covered by the Louisiana Purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.823" offset="3234670">Article III of that purchase and that's the only reference that provides that the inhabitants of this area that is ceded to the United States by France shall be -- they shall enjoy their freedom, their religion, their constitutional rights that the Federal Government would afford them hand that the inhabitants perhaps at some future date might become a citizen of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.540" offset="3577501">Now, the only thing having disposed of the Louisiana Purchase briefly rather than to recite school boy history that Jefferson was severely attacked by purchasing Louisiana as an executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.169" offset="3648031">To add on he had doubts in his own mind and due correspondence are indicators he thought a Constitutional Amendment was necessary to enact this territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.912" offset="3702993">He was apparently dissuaded on that decision, so the treaty was affirmed 24/7, I think on Christmas Eve 1903, I mean 1803, if I drop a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.193" offset="3772165">But the interesting part of that is in 1802, Georgia made a cession pact ceding part of their land right following that to the Osages and return for a certain land.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.640" offset="3853981">Then in 1808, the Osages began a negotiation with treaty, ratified in 1810.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.966" offset="3891284">But in 1809, the Cherokees called upon Jefferson or they petitioned him in regard to the way they were being treated and so forth and their possible move to the west and this also was in between the negotiations with the Osage Treaty and ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.754" offset="4010402">Then in 1909, Jefferson said, gave his blessings and said to, “My children go forth and seek this land” and directed them to the Arkansas and White Rivers and said the higher the better which incorporates part of the land that is in contention today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.522" offset="4145507">Now with reference to the treaties, the 1835 treaties in effect incorporates, I'm speaking of Cherokees, the treaty of 1817, of 1833 and 1835.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.903" offset="4214993">In Brewer v. Elliot, the Court clearly spoke that the Louisiana Purchase could not intervene where a tribe was granted a fee simple title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.592" offset="4269746">Of course, in Cherokee Tobacco, it was held that a treaty may suspend a prior Act of Congress and an Act of Congress may suspend the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.567" offset="4321677">By later treaties that the Louisiana Purchase had any validity, it certainly was not advocated, but modified by the subsequent treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.025" offset="4367444">But the thing that we're trying to construe in this case in my mind is a clear language of the treaty prescribed in the 1833 Treaty adopted in the 1935 Treaty and the patent that was adopted in 1938 and the language in the treaty so far as the land covered is consistent with the patent, that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.390" offset="4492936">And there are case after case, Creek case and I think Holden v. Joy and several other cases of this Court that holds that we did get title in fee simple for these five civilized tribes; Choctaw, Cherokees, Creek, Seminoles, Chickasaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.281" offset="4632534">Now, as to the conveyance, it was a simple conveyance and as Holmes pointed out in the Fleming case, 215 U.S. that the United States would choose to use any language it wanted to, but it chose a simple language of conveyance that the average citizen would understand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.179" offset="5964048">There are really two arguments made by the State of Oklahoma in order to claim the bed of the navigable portion of the Arkansas River which is in dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.812" offset="6018591">The first is that these Indian tribes never obtained title to the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.013" offset="6051401">The second is that if they did, they lost it at some subsequent time.</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1496.505" stopTime="1804.871">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="1496.505" offset="6089435">Well, they would say -- well, they don't press these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.896" offset="6102915">They have suggested here and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.290" offset="6112528">I take it that they're not pressed as their main arguments, “lost by voluntarily relinquishment in the 1890's just prior to statehood,” that is prior to Oklahoma statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.508" offset="6165400">They have received that they have taken from them or that they gave it away when they agreed to an allotment of their land or were forced to allot their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.555" offset="6201553">The second of these arguments would be that they cease to exist as a nation and therefore under the terms of the grants, these communal tribal lands reverted to United States and in turn inundate to the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.775" offset="6266441">That is an argument which barely suggested by Oklahoma and I hope not seriously pressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.962" offset="6295176">More seriously, I think, they suggest that neither tribe the Choctaws, Chickasaws together nor the Cherokees ever obtained title to the bed of the river and I make two arguments in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.352" offset="6356825">The first is that as a technical manner conveyancing, these treaties and patents did not embrace the bed of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.544" offset="6401546">The second is that even if the patents broadly embrace the bed that was an implied reservation by the United States in these grants for the benefit of some future state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.995" offset="6467375">As to the first proposition, I think what is most noteworthy when one traces down the various descriptions and the various treaties and the various patents is that the grant to the Cherokees and the grants to the Choctaws are always defined one with relation to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.894" offset="6566954">The boundary between them is spoken of as common corner, the Cherokee corner or the Choctaw corner at the extreme downward point of the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.762" offset="6638425">There are references to the river which talk about down the main channel which doesn't sound like along the north bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.073" offset="6675623">Finally, and I think most of persuasive, is the almost unthinkable proposition that in grants of this size and as the little map I have prepared for the Court indicates, the whole of the state of Oklahoma except the panhandle was granted to three Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.106" offset="6771754">The Cherokees at the north, the Creeks and Seminoles in the center, Choctaws and Chickasaws at the bottom, each of these grants is of a huge tract of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.059" offset="6823581">In the case of the Cherokees, it's an approximately 14 million acres, roughly three times the size of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.605" offset="6849808">The Choctaw and the Chickasaw grant is considerably larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.637" offset="6869870">All of this territory, west of the Arkansas boundary was intended to be and to remain Indian Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.642" offset="6909889">These enormous grants to what were then described as nations meant to remain forever as quasi-independent, quasi-sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.441" offset="6977181">It is unthinkable, I think, that the riverbeds were meant to be left out when all of this territory west of the line was confined to the tribes all in contiguous grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.429" offset="7049070">Much the same considerations weigh against the second argument advanced by Oklahoma, which is that the United States impliedly reserved the beds even though they're caught within the description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.070" offset="7103613">I should emphasize that in one instance, it's quite clear that the bed of the river is caught within the description of that portion of the Arkansas River that is entirely embraced by Cherokee lands on both sides which runs from Fort Gibson to the confluence of the Arkansas with the Canadian River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.476" offset="7197236">Now the notion that the United States would have, in this instance, reserve to itself the benefit of a future state, the bed of the Arkansas River insofar as it was navigable is at odds both with the understanding of the times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.647" offset="7278007">First of all, that doctrine had not yet been articulated and it's only several years later, this Court for the first time developed that proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.571" offset="7685622">Picking up from Mr. Justice Marshall's question, let me say broadly that the realistic situation here is that the Government of the United States determine that all lands west of a certain boundary that ultimately was the boundary of the State of Arkansas should be Indian lands, a whole enormous territory which includes present Oklahoma and some other lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.909" offset="7802964">Subsequently, it was determined to divide that acreage between these several tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.752" offset="7834415">The exact descriptions of that division should not be dispositive as to whether all of that Indian country was then meant to be and to remain an Indian territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.584" offset="7893661">From that point on, from the 1820's on and later when this territory was called the Indian Territory, nobody ever thought that any portion of it had been kept back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.305" offset="7948622">The exact boundaries between the several grants were matters of some dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.374" offset="7972864">Some of the grants originally were overlapping, were found to be overlapping and were then corrected, but the general picture and I think this is a fair statement, is that all of that land was meant to be Indian land in which white settlers were excluded and it ought not to be dispositive whether the coals in certain surveys exactly match or do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.598" offset="8081742">As a matter of fact, we think here that the descriptions do show a contiguous boundary between the Cherokee and the Choctaw grant where the Oklahoma -- where the Arkansas River is the boundary between them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.168" offset="8300022">At that time it was simply sand and gravel removal, it was not oil or gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.134" offset="8323950">The value of the bed at that time I suppose was minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.909" offset="8342967">I may say also that to the extent that these tribes are taxed with not having brought this suit earlier, it was not at all clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.795" offset="8378598">In fact, it was assumed after Cherokee Nation versus Georgia that these tribes have no standing of their own to bring the suit in the federal court and because they couldn't bring one in the state court without the consent of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.127" offset="8931871">Finally, I should say in fairness that the tribes' approach the Department of Interior some years ago seeking to have the United States file the suit on behalf of the tribes which was then -- which has been an established practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.171" offset="8992057">The Department of Interior did not refuse to do so, but took it's time in processing the request and ultimately the tribes brought their own suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2254.786" offset="9122565">Going back, these grants were in no sense, as though they were grants to private owners of even large estates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.271" offset="9240430">There were recognitions and grants, not only of property in the real estate sense, but a political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.253" offset="9280345">The treaties themselves and the opinions of this Court rendered just two and three years before in Cherokee Nation versus Georgia, and Worcester versus Georgia by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall indicated to what extraordinary extent these tribes, these civilized tribes were independent nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.835" offset="9370728">They were held not to be foreign states, but they were held in every other respect to be independent political sovereignties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.512" offset="9409390">Under those circumstances and considering also the terminology of the grants which I remind the Court were in terms of a fee simple title, in terms of a permanent home for these tribes of Indians and with a special assurance that at no future time would a state be called out or surround them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.550" offset="9509595">It is -- it seems to us that one cannot realistically suppose that there was any intention to retain for the benefit of the future state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3852.434" offset="15513057">Now, the trial court found and its finding was not challenged, that this stretch of the Arkansas River was navigable in fact and in law at the time the western domains, now a part of Oklahoma, were ceded to the Choctaw Nation and to the Cherokee Nation and at the time the treaties were made, pursuant to which the lands were ceded and also at the time Oklahoma was admitted to statehood on November 16, 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.754" offset="15686405">We consider the fact of established navigability at the time these treaties were made to be a very important fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.661" offset="15722036">That was so found by the trial court and has not been challenged in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3935.871" offset="15846902">In the case of Pollard versus Hagan, Mr. Justice McKinley in an opinion written in 1845 referring to an opinion written in 1842 by Mr. Justice Taney said in the case of Martin et. al. versus Waddell, 16 Peters 410, the present Chief Justice Taney in delivering the opinion of the Court said, “When the revolution took place, the people of each state became themselves sovereign and in that character hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common use, subject only to the rights since surrendered by the Constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.829" offset="16078660">In the case of Pollard versus Hagan, the Court went on and said, “We have arrived at these general conclusions; First, the shores of navigable waters and the soils under them were not granted by the Constitution to the United States, but were reserved to the states respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.437" offset="16189106">Second, the new states have the same rights, sovereignty and jurisdiction over this subject as the original states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.551" offset="16233618">The State of Oklahoma was admitted on an equal footing with the original states and we say that this law is it that was applicable, set forth in the case of Martin versus Waddell and the case of Pollard versus Hagan is still applicable today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.876" offset="16310836">Now, the most complete and erudite opinion that has been written on the subject of the rights of the states with respect to navigable waters was written by Mr. Justice Gray in the case of Shively versus Bowlby in 1893.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.584" offset="16413759">In that case Mr. Justice Gray commented that this was an occasion suitable for a complete review of the law as had been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.860" offset="16470810">He went back to the beginning to the common law of England as applied in the American colonies to the common law as applied after the revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.078" offset="16543640">He reviewed the whole range of decisions that had been handed down since then and wrote what seem us to be a guiding opinion in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.883" offset="16614902">Now, he did say that he -- when the United States acquires a territory, it does have a demonstrative jurisdiction over it and it holds it in trust for the formation of future states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.752" offset="16686373">Now, he says some certain dispositions can be made when necessary by the United States during territorial period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.694" offset="16726183">He said we cannot doubt therefore, that Congress has the power to make grants of land below high watermark of navigable waters in any territory of the United States, whenever it becomes necessary to do so, first in order to perform international obligations; second to effect of improvement of such lands for promotion and convenience of the commerce with foreign nations and among the sovereign states; or third to carry out other public purposes appropriate to the objects for which the United States holds the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.451" offset="16909145">Now, he goes further in that opinion and he defines what the objects for which the United States holds the territory are.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.666" offset="16954075">With respect to that he said this, “And the territories acquired by Congress whether by deed of cession from the original states or by treaty with a foreign country are held with the object as soon as their population and condition justify it of being admitted into the union as states upon an equal footing with the original states in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.362" offset="17084792">The Congress of the United States in disposing of the public lands has constantly acted upon the theory that those lands whether in interior or on the coast, above high water mark they be taken up by actual occupants in order to encourage the settlement of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.546" offset="17157517">But the navigable waters and the soils under them whether within or above the ebb and flow of the tide shall be and remain public highways and being chiefly valuable for the public purposes of commerce, navigation and fishery for the improvements necessary to secure and promote those purposes shall not be granted away during the period of territorial Government, but unless in case of some international duty or public exigency shall be held by the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4450.990" offset="17907336">That will be a part of my argument, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.866" offset="17942862">In the case of United States versus Holt State Bank and I might say that we differ on the facts and the holding of that case, and the counsel for the Choctaws who has argued previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.485" offset="18001272">We have set forth however our understanding of the facts on the holding of that case on pages 35 to 37 of our brief and we refer the Court to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.090" offset="18043695">I won't go into that in detail here at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.379" offset="18064906">But to get -- in that case, the Court actually reaffirmed the principles laid down in Shively versus Bowlby where they said the United States early adopted and constantly hasn't heard to the policy of regarding lands under navigable waters and acquired territory while under its sole dominion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.547" offset="18169605">It's held for the ultimate benefit of the future states and so has refrained from making any disposal thereof say in exceptional instances when impelled to particular disposals by some international duty or public exigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.046" offset="18247555">It follows from this that disposals by the United States during the territorial period are not likely to be inferred, should not be regarded as intended unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.049" offset="18319548">That language was used with respect to a statute, the United States statute in a form of a treaty with the Chippewas which set aside a reservation, a Red Lake Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.963" offset="18383182">Within the reservation was a navigable lake, Mud Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.075" offset="18403662">Mud Lake was not mentioned as being conveyed to the Chippewas and the Court held it was not conveyed because there was not a specific reference to Mud Lake in the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.481" offset="18465311">That was a holding in this case of this Court in Holt State Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.155" offset="18484015">We say that applies with respect to the Arkansas River here and particularly with respect to the part where the Cherokees have land on each side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.963" offset="18547231">Now, there is -- with respect to the Chippewa title which has been questioned here; that title we think is a good reservation title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.268" offset="18612433">It has been so defined and held in Minnesota versus Hitchcock 185 U.S. 373 and a similar type of title has been affirmed in the United States versus Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company, 314 U.S. 339 with respect to the Hualapai tribe in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.763" offset="18714415">The patents issued to the Cherokees and the Choctaws were authorized by the Indian Removal Act of May 28, 1830.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.035" offset="18775542">That provided that for granting patents in removed Indian tribes and contained a provision that provided always that such land shall revert to the United States if the Indians become extinct or abandon the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.454" offset="18853177">So, the Cherokee patent pursuant to that Indian Removal Act provides the lands hereby granted shall revert to the United States if the Cherokee Nation ceases and abandons the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.088" offset="18919737">The Choctaw patent provides, it shall inhere to them as long as they shall exist as a nation and live on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.071" offset="18963623">Now, coming to the Cherokee treaties and the Cherokee patent on the subject that you expressed particular interest in, Mr. Justice White, the western Cherokees' first land in Oklahoma was acquired pursuant to the treaty of 1828, 7 Stat. 311.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.271" offset="19064456">In that treaty, it was agreed that seven million acres of land plus an outlet west should be conveyed to the Cherokees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.225" offset="19128299">The description of the land was incomplete.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.956" offset="19147212">When they got to the -- where the Arkansas comes to a confluence with the Canadian, they angled off up between the two and they didn't close it with the Arkansas state line, but they have provided they'd have a survey and which would correct all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.612" offset="19225788">The 1833 Treaty with the western Cherokees has also covered the same land substantially except that down toward the lower part, the boundary line between the Creeks and the Cherokees was straightened out and settled whereas under the 1828 Treaty it was left open up in the area, I might say it, but that boundary was left open to on the north westerly side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.616" offset="19373850">But the parties had in mind having a survey and they did have a survey and it was conducted, shortly work on it was commenced, shortly after the 1828 Treaty, under the direction of Reverend Isaac McCoy who was commissioned to do the surveying by the war department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.769" offset="19474474">The map which we have provided for the Court here is the result, the final result of Reverend McCoy's surveying work down under Reverend McCoy and his basis for the description in the Cherokee patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.240" offset="19552319">The field notes which we have provided the Court with copies on enlarged basis, both of which are in our briefs as appendix, describe the first line that was run by that surveying crew under McCoy's direction by a surveyor by the name of Donaldson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.692" offset="19662137">In that line, he ran the line between the State of Arkansas and the Cherokees on the west and the state Arkansas on the east when he comes down to this corner and he uses as a reference point, the land in the Choctaw corner across the river which he fixes on the south bank of the river and he sets the Cherokee corner on the north bank of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="5976.179" offset="24008077">I hope you won't turn the Court and engineer, we currently have, so I wish that you could compare the calls of the survey and the patent done by the Cherokee and they read the same in reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.090" offset="24115702">So far as I can tell, there's a difference between 47 and 53 degrees; it might have around the three.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.299" offset="24156557">We have never claimed the half the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.010" offset="24167424">It's clearly stated in the patent and it's not inconsistent with the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.421" offset="24197099">Two, just to three in Alabama v. Texas in speaking of disposal of the public lands and the equal footing doctrine and the concurring opinion said specifically, United States has power to dispose of it's public lands under the power -- under the so called equal footing doctrine and it's not intended to equate the states on economic basis, but on a political basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.309" offset="24328652">Each state can't hope to have it, either New York or Manhattan or gold or silver.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.970" offset="24363238">That's not the purpose and read as late as that said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.634" offset="24397928">The -- I would like to call the Court's specific attention to the Enabling Act of Oklahoma which is cited on page 26 of our brief and the Oklahoma Constitution which specifically provides that these Indian tribes will be protected in the possession of their land.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.131" offset="24527914">And the previous act which is referred to by Mr. Kirk in the court of law as extinguishing the tribe is simply without meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.937" offset="24591130">The Court so far as this map is concerned then without relationship to what value there is, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="6135.725" offset="24646301">Certainly, on February the 25th in the State of Arkansas v. Tennessee met and answered the same question concerning [Inaudible] accretion or erosion whether it be by natural or artificial means.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.502" offset="24745357">The Cherokees are an existing tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.464" offset="24765210">They have some 41,000 enrolled, 4,000 full bloods and a total of descendants of 100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6179.230" offset="24820276">The money that we have derived from any recovery in these cases outside of the per capita distributions to the Indians, not only in the so-called outlet case, but in many other cases that Mr. Pear participated then has gone in trust for the Indians and is used either for rehabilitation, higher education and various vocable projects.</text>
