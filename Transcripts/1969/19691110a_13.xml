            <label>Mr. Will R. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="11.312" offset="149692">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.473" offset="162335">This is a Fourth Amendment criminal case involving a conviction for the sale of heroin reversed by the Circuit Court on the Katz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.023" offset="212490">This was a narcotic agent wired for -- with a Kel radio without a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.096" offset="244778">It involved the purchase, delivery, payment and the sale of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.817" offset="271632">The informer to negotiate the parties was not available to testify so the case was proved altogether out of government agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.565" offset="314681">One of them whom hid on the closet and others heard the -- some of the conversation over a Kel radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.233" offset="353343">In all, there were four kitchen meetings in the home of the informant government agent type, one in the defendant’s home, two in the informer’s car and one in the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.900" offset="407991">The facts are that on December 9, 1965, informant Harvey Jackson met in his own kitchen the defendant White.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.624" offset="458877">At that time, there was a narcotics agent hiding in a closet where he could see in here the events in the kitchen and the informant had on him a Kel radio which is a short-range radio and there was a narcotics agent in the car, a short distance away from the house listening to the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.659" offset="555008">At that time, there was a delivery of one ounce of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.351" offset="569846">On December the 10th, there was another such meeting at which the same setup with the -- at which time the informant paid a thousand dollars and agreed to purchase some additional heroin the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.636" offset="638913">On December the 14th, the informant went to defendant White’s home also with a radio on him and went in and paid the defendant in his home and agreed to purchase two additional ounces, at that time a government agent was outside listening to the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.424" offset="738074">On December the 16th of 1965 in the informant’s car, the informant and the defendant drove for two hours with the informant having on him a Kel radio and with agents of the narcotic bureau following the car and listening to the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.836" offset="827726">In that series of events the defendant took the informant’s car and let the informant out, and met another man named Sam Minerva who gave him heroin and then he picked up the informant again.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.655" offset="895018">On December the 18th, back in informant Jackson’s kitchen, at his home with Jackson and White at the table, the agent in the closet, the agent outside listening to the radio, there was paid $1,250.00 on the transaction by Jackson to White.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.838" offset="983730">On December the 29th of 1965, White met the informant Jackson agreed to meet him at Lake and Royal Street in Chicago each drove his own car.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.568" offset="1034616">White walked up to Jackson’s car and delivered the heroin with Jackson being having on his radio and the agent is listening from some distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.365" offset="1073904">On January the 5th, in the informant Jackson’s kitchen with the same setup, White -- Jackson paid White $1,300.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.020" offset="1124477">On the January the 8th, at a restaurant called the Luminar Restaurant which the defendant have some connection with, they met, discussed, again with the radio on and the narcotic agent outside the restaurant listening to the camera -- conversation agreed to meet at leg in Well Street and purchased three things of heroin for $2500.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.045" offset="1224579">On January the 9th, White, the defendant drove up and stopped and stayed in Randall Street where he was met by Minerva delivering the narcotic and at that time the agents close-in and made the arrest and the case was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.763" offset="1283406">So to recap, there were four meetings in informant kitchen. One meeting in defendant’s home, two meetings in informant’s car, one meeting at the Luminar Restaurant and addition to that, an overhearing on the telephone, the very offset of the Katz case where the informant called the defendant and permitted the agents to listen in on his end of the telephone through the same receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.655" offset="1387060">So, let’s look first at what questions are not involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.773" offset="1407540">We do not have any questions of the Fifth or Sixth Amendment because this is not the overhearing of conversations about past events in the nature of admission or a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.209" offset="1457277">This is an overhearing of the actual transaction itself and there is no recitation relied on and put in the evidence or involved here that would involve either the Fifth Amendment or Sixth Amendment questions in the sense of either testifying against himself as to past events or the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.456" offset="1550169">And that we think is fairly clear if you consider the situation involving the normal condition of bank lobby now where there is a hidden camera and frequently hidden radio or recording devices, and a bank robber comes in and triggers the camera and the camera records the actual crime itself and the recording device or radio records the words used by the bank robber in committing the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.124" offset="1664899">I think no one would seriously contend that there was any constitutional question in the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth involved in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.314" offset="1697604">Here the radio was substantially the same thing, a broadcast of the crime itself being committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.373" offset="1733862">The -- White’s conversation and the words used give him an evidence were all a part of the contract and sale, a commercial transaction, a contract and sale of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.553" offset="1774613">This is not a crime of violence or any other kind of crime except a commercial transaction and it is by law made illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.241" offset="1809408">So, the -- as far as the informant’s kitchen and car is concerned, there’s no trespass because they belonged to the informant who invited the defendant White to come there and make the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.934" offset="1892164">And the restaurant was a public place and defendant’s home was no trespassed because the defendant invited the informant to come to his home to take -- to make payment for the narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.098" offset="1960814">All of that is pretty well governed by the Lewis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.347" offset="1973770">Now that brings us to Katz which is you all know is the bugging of a telephone booth situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.678" offset="2003132">And its discussions of the expectation of privacy which is probably the central question that the court will be concerned with in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.309" offset="2045659">And so we could ask ourselves what legal expectations of privacy did the lower court to defendant White when he went to defendant’s Jackson -- to Jackson’s kitchen to sell narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.824" offset="2103651">Certainly, the law does not protect White against the other part of the transaction testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.211" offset="2129251">This is a -- as I said this is a bargain and sale, a contract made partly in words, partly by the passage of money, and partly by the passage of the narcotics, the delivery of narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.015" offset="2184422">And whether civil or criminal either side can testify as to a contract, and either, in any type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.885" offset="2223919">So when the parties enter into a commercial transaction that is by law made criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.494" offset="2246384">Either party can testify so White had no expectation of privacy that the other side of his contract wouldn’t and couldn’t testify to it as he had a perfect legal right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.245" offset="2305421">And then there is in the situation language which comes in that I think needs to be clarified somewhat and that is this coming from some of the older cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.174" offset="2361114">The question of misplaced confidences between the seller of narcotics who is selling to a government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.481" offset="2398312">And I want to point out that this was arm’s length transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.540" offset="2414508">This isn’t a -- there wasn’t any relationship of confidence between this two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.851" offset="2431749">It’s not husband and wife, lawyer-client, or doctor-patient, a priest-penitent, anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.877" offset="2455886">This is a sale between strangers and an arm’s length sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.137" offset="2476993">And one of the risks that a man in the illegal business of selling narcotics takes is that some of his customers will turn to out to be government agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.161" offset="2509072">And he knows that when he goes in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.729" offset="2519312">He runs that risk and so there isn’t any misplaced confidence in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.999" offset="2560376">And certainly the law does not protect White against either the fact that may turn out to be a government agent and that he may testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.086" offset="2640729">And there’s no breach of duty on the part of the informant in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.824" offset="2707707">In this that it gives to the policy of the question raised by the former Chief Justice in his dissent in one of this cases and that is, can the Government use the recorded or secondary testimony if you want to call it that when the informant doesn’t testify?</text>
            <text syncTime="668.152" offset="2776984">In this case, we could not and find the informant at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.714" offset="2791299">And it is -- it becomes then I guess a policy question as to where there the Government should or should not be able to use the testimony at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.406" offset="2830064">But it’s not a constitutional question because the constitutional rights are determined as of the time of the search and not by the development of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.202" offset="3293163">We did not refuse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.756" offset="3319390">Now, as to the agent hiding in the closet I see no constitutional question on that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.291" offset="3361604">As to the Kel radio which is the central question before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.259" offset="3385428">There’s nothing sinister about a radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.530" offset="3394518">It’s -- the radio is a common part of our life now used in all types of communication as good law enforcement technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.653" offset="3430985">It increased the accuracy of proving the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.738" offset="3443315">It helps detect the safety of the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.534" offset="3450525">Now, one of the things that we’re concerned with is in this narcotic purchases, that’s a rather dangerous business for the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.393" offset="3481976">And if he is in there and needs help, the agent listening on the outside can determine that and come in once long go at lost made under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.069" offset="3544670">It makes it better development of all aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.368" offset="3561911">Frequently, on a propose purchase of narcotics when the agent goes in to an apart where there something it turns out that he negotiates with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.924" offset="3596079">They don’t have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.068" offset="3600677">They said, they say you wait here and will send forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.263" offset="3613424">They send forth and if the agents on the outside have the intelligence that conversation they can follow the man and get his source and take him to where he is going for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.657" offset="3655011">If they don’t have that, they may arrest -- I mean, make their arrest prematurely there, their raids prematurely and they do not have a smooth development of the case that they do using the Kel radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.590" offset="3714779">And as especially true in the business of following the cars, it’s difficult to follow a car in traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.504" offset="3738394">If they do not have a radio communication in tailing the car, they have to be closer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.332" offset="3757725">If they got a radio communication with an informant from the car, they can drop back and have a great deal more success in following the car at a distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.781" offset="3795550">It protects the defendant against falls testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.460" offset="3810283">These narcotic agents nature things they are usually addicts, they are not perhaps the most reliable people in the world in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.809" offset="3843615">And this gives the Bureau of Narcotics a check and a protection on the agent himself of framing a defendant when they can listen to the conversation and hear it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.621" offset="3914877">Now taking the subject of these consensual overhearings direct, we take the flat position that a consensual overhearing where one party to a conversation consents does not involve Fourth Amendment problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.055" offset="4028667">Just recently in the case of Frazier versus Cupp which was a search and seizure case involving a duffel bag where two, I believe it was a murder case, had hidden the clothes that they wore at the time crime in a duffel bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.220" offset="4097317">And one of the defendants gave permission to the officers to search the duffel bag without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.695" offset="4123126">It was held that that was illegal search and so having one of the parties having consent, the search was legal as to both of them and the close could be used in evidence against the non-consenting party in that type of search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.460" offset="4174221">Well, the same thing would apply to both ends of a telephone conversation or radio conversation and having to see no difference between the overheard telephone conversations in this case and the overheard radio conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.353" offset="4229810">They were, if they are legal without a warrant on the Fourth Amendment, it’s because of the consent of one of the parties of the conversation and it seems to me they are the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.319" offset="4273695">It’s almost the exact opposite of the situation, the Katz case where the listing device was put in on without the consent of either party and on the end of the person who was under trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.334" offset="4357705">Of course, the Court’s familiar with the Lopez case where and IRS agent went into a bribe situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.926" offset="4384141">I may say that the Government uses this Kel radios in two main situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.859" offset="4407860">In the main, one is for narcotics cases and the second is for bribery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.653" offset="4426982">And bribery is one of the central problems in Government as everybody knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.746" offset="4451432">Now, in the Lopez case, IRS agent went in with the recoding device and I personally see no difference between a recording device and a Kel radio which puts it outside for notes or recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.651" offset="4507021">And it was held there in an arm’s length transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.632" offset="4522904">No confidential relationship between a government agent for the IRS and the taxpayer that there was no expectation of privacy in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.929" offset="4580164">And that bring us to On Lee, perhaps one of the earliest of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.378" offset="4605868">In On Lee of course has been greatly criticized and it is vulnerable criticism on the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and that is the obtaining by stealth of confession or admission after the event which is On Lee as the Court remembers, the narcotic agent went into the laundry and the agent stayed outside after the case have been made and after indictment and it raises both Fifth and Sixth Amendment problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.565" offset="4710672">It was upheld on the Fourth and my feeling is that it was correctly upheld on the Fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.545" offset="4734600">Again, a consensual hearing is not a search and seizure situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.767" offset="4779426">The defendant has raised questions about whether this is a true consensual case based upon the proof track court found that informant Jackson did consent and we have covered that as a factual matter in extensive supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.678" offset="4855077">Now to reiterate the point raised a few minutes ago about the informant himself not testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.478" offset="4898335">Our position is that that’s not a constitutional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.531" offset="4914531">It might go to the weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.623" offset="4922890">It might go to some search problem as best evidence but it doesn’t goes the constitutionality of the search because that must be determined as of the time of the search and not by subsequent technical developments in the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.593" offset="5014737">I’d like to reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.728" offset="5659335">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.114" offset="5672814">United States versus James A. White is not a case of consensual eavesdropping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.734" offset="5703325">The record below and the Government’s own statement of facts and its free from the merits do not support the contention that there was consent by the informant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.166" offset="5769049">This issue was raised by the respondent in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.768" offset="5795485">The Court of Appeals specifically stated in their en banc opinion that they did not reach the issue of consent because they did not feel that it was material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.697" offset="5859224">The Government in their petition for writ of certiorari in their statement of facts stated that the informant consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.765" offset="5907498">In our brief, in our position I call to their attention the fact that the record did not support consent -- voluntary consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.555" offset="5958593">Interestingly enough, in their statement of facts in their brief on the merits, there is no claim that the informant voluntarily consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.557" offset="6014600">On Friday, I received the reply brief where the Government argues that this -- it would be fair for this Court to infer that the informant acted freely and voluntarily because he work for the Government for about eight days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.463" offset="6086280">Of course, the first day work was when the first situation of the electronic eavesdropping took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.518" offset="6130479">The Government quotes from a District of Columbia, District Court case United States versus Sorkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.748" offset="6159423">I have no quarrel with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.652" offset="6171021">However, the only thing that case held was that if the informant hoped that there were be leniency if he cooperated, this did not necessarily mean that he involuntarily consent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.713" offset="6235282">But the Court stated that if the Government promise leniency or if they went out and found a weak person or a vulnerable person and turned them into informants, they would restraint this use because this -- the record would not support a finding or voluntary consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.988" offset="6328383">The Court went on to say that consent in type of cases should be decided just like consent in any ordinary search and seizure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.183" offset="6385121">Now, the Government’ failure or tires to excuse this failure to sustain its burden of proving consent by saying that the defense never raise the consent issue at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.130" offset="6440918">Well, I submit that it was raised a trial and that the Court ruled because there was an objection to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.572" offset="6474668">There was a motion the strike all the evidence obtained by the eavesdropping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.634" offset="6494939">The Government cited a number of cases to the trial judge On Lee, Lopez case, and a number of Seventh Circuit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.127" offset="6532869">Every case cited was a situation where there was consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.376" offset="6565888">The trial court then just stated that we’ve been through this before and overall the motion to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.652" offset="6606952">We submit that it’s the Government’s burden whenever they rely upon consent to sustain the lawfulness of a search and seizure but the burden is upon them to prove consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.878" offset="6663899">This Court in Bumper versus North Carolina held and I just give a short quote, “When a prosecutor seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a search he has the burden of proving that the consent was in fact freely and voluntarily given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.991" offset="6748327">The Court further -- this Court further said that acquiescence is not sufficient consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.406" offset="12650015">This type of radio communication is used right from the inception of the case before you have a probable cause frequently and if you have to get a warrant before you use it, it will prevent the building of proper cause and secondly, in a rapidly developing narcotics sale, the agent frequently does not know either the place or the people he is going to be negotiating with.</text>
