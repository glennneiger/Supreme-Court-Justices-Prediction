            <text syncTime="10.492" offset="145324">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.257" offset="152430">This appeal raises the question whether when a time when urban problems are recognized by virtually every thoughtful person in every social commentator examining American life to be of the most serious proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.577" offset="205720">The State of New York made out employee; it's concededly limited resources in the field of social welfare in such a way as to address itself to these problems with slightly greater emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.408" offset="248978">Now, 131-a of the Social Services Law of New York which is the statute of this case is all about provides levels of welfare allowances for welfare recipients in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.061" offset="299656">It was enacted by the 1969 legislature and as I'm sure the Court knows it was the same statute that was involved in Rosado against Wyman which this Court decided in April 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.905" offset="350960">Section 131-a establishes levels at one rate for welfare recipients within New York City and it is slightly lower rate approximately $5.00 a person for welfare recipients living outside New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.248" offset="416371">It then goes on to give the appellant, Commissioner Wyman, the State Commissioner of Social Services, discretion under an Amendment which was passed prior to the effective date of 131-a, which was July 1, 1969, discretion to increase the payments in any county upon the request of that county or indeed without the request of that county if the facts warrant and prior to the effective date of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.561" offset="521592">Commissioner Wyman did indeed exercise that discretion and he have the differential between the New York City Welfare Payments and the Welfare Payments in the suburban counties including Nassau and Westchester counties which are adjacent to New York, essentially suburban counties and which the two counties in which the plaintiff here reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.315" offset="612603">It has to be presumed as this Court has stated on many occasions that the state legislature acted with that knowledge of local conditions and indeed the assemblymen and state senators who passed this section of the Social Services Law are elected from very small districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.367" offset="676864">They're about as close to their local constituencies as any elected representative can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.386" offset="696926">Their district is so much smaller and they represent less people than a congressman, and they have to be presumed to be aware of local conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.597" offset="729736">Indeed, it's noteworthy that the assemblyman from Nassau and Westchester counties predominantly voted for this bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.061" offset="887620">The differential still exists except that as a result of the very sweeping preliminary injunctions issued by the three-judge District Court in this case the state is now paying the identical payment to welfare recipients in the counties involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.242" offset="952299">But that's only because of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.519" offset="961494">But the 1970 legislation, a copy of which is annexed to our reply brief which was then superseded by a slightly different statute copies of which we mailed to the Court last week when it was enacted still maintains the differentials, only that the figures are slightly different their higher but the differential still exists except in so far as the preliminary injunction has eliminated it for the purposes of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.642" offset="1441938">Under the Equal Protection Clause is still a question of whether there's any rational basis for the differential and as we shall show there's a more than adequate basis for that differential for the reasons which were reduced before the three-judge court in which I'd like to expound on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.081" offset="1507662">It should be noted before we turn to that that these payments don't include rent or fuel for heating and the record shows that the actual payments received by welfare recipients in New York City for rent which have paid over and above these statutory or administratively set allowances are considerably higher in the suburban counties than they are in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.818" offset="1590627">Indeed as the record show here, a -- the average rent received by welfare family of four in New York City is $84.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.277" offset="1620511">The plaintiffs here who are single women just one person, are getting a $105.00 and $108.00 a month, if my memory serves over a hundred many event and in Nassau county, the record indicates that the maximum permissible payment for family of four is a $155.00 or a $160.00 a month depending on whether it is an apartment or a private house.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.707" offset="1702222">But that almost double the average that's received in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.416" offset="1717060">This is due to rent control and I suppose to the larger amount of apartments available in New York City and the general squeeze and housing in the suburban counties which have grown so rapidly over the past years.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.771" offset="1762408">But in any event, whatever the reasons when discussing the actual benefits or allowances received by welfare recipient of which shelter is obviously one of the basic components.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.030" offset="1807444">You've got to look not only at the welfare allowance which doesn't include shelter but also at the cost of shelter which is also paid by the commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.716" offset="1842239">And since the cost of rental are so much less in New York City and averages also that in fact these plaintiffs and other similarly situated in Nassau and Westchester counties are actually receiving as much money or perhaps more as people in New York City.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.225" offset="2012244">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.537" offset="2013497">But the heat is a -- it's he minimum item, it doesn't exist in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.463" offset="2033246">In any event, while we unfortunately don't have in the record full statistics on the total aggregate amount of rental money and fuel for heating paid in New York City vis-à-vis what's paid in the suburban counties?</text>
            <text syncTime="494.989" offset="2083297">The record does indicate that the average rental for welfare recipients in New York City is so much lower than these plaintiffs in particular received or that the maximum permitted in Nassau County and Westchester is that the record indicates plainly that fall from being discriminated against are receiving less money when shelter is considered as a certainly it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.447" offset="2173158">They're coming out just as well as a person in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.489" offset="2185279">But over above that the claim here is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and also of the Social Security Act and Regulations there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.204" offset="2228224">And the court below, we submit improperly and certainly improperly in the light of this Court's opinion in Dandridge bypass completely the Social Security Act and Regulation claim and instead of veering away from the constitutional issue as courts are suppose to.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.173" offset="2292067">It in effect veered toward it and went out of its way to determine the constitutional question adversely to the state as it happens and we submit that reversal as required on that ground alone over above everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.662" offset="2342013">But this statute has to be viewed whether we talked of equal protection or the statute in regulation in the context of a statutory scheme in New York State which traditionally treats New York City as sui generis and indeed New York City is a special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.577" offset="2401677">It's -- it's the urban megalopolis par excellence.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.720" offset="2414216">It comprises half the people in New York State and indeed, more than half of the welfare recipients about three-quarters as the record states and the -- throughout the statutes in New York, we see special treatment given New York City far and excess I'm sure of this special treatment given Chicago or Baltimore or Philadelphia in the statutes of those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.694" offset="2494151">Indeed, this Court itself in Salzburg against Maryland remarked quoting an earlier case Missouri against Lewis, a 19th century case that it would be permissible under the Equal Protection Clause for New York State to apply the civil code, the civil law in the New York City in common law of the rest of the state if it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.280" offset="2568443">Now, that's sounds like hyperbole but this Court said it and it quoted it Salzburg against Maryland which is a case from the 1950's.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.327" offset="2600730">The fact is that New York City is different, it is unique, and the legislature has to be presumed to be aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.411" offset="2629047">The -- our brief and balance specific examples, for example the Multiple Dwelling Law which prescribes all kinds of requirements for apartment houses, only applies to New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.265" offset="2668440">There's a Multiple Residence Law which is entirely different which applies to the apartment houses outside New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.627" offset="2693831">As this Court knows well from the Baldwin case which is before it, the entire structure of the penal law is the code of criminal procedure is different in New York City and indeed this Court has before it the question of whether New York State can permissibly within the Equal Protection Clause give jury trials for misdemeanors outside the city and not give them in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.492" offset="2777318">Now, whatever the rights and wrongs are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.671" offset="2786095">It's again illustrative of the fact that the New York legislature has traditionally treated New York City as a very, very different thing from the rest of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.507" offset="2821413">Now, when we look at Section 131-a, we don't see the enormous difference that we find in these areas where you talking about giving jury trials in one place and not somewhere else or having stringent requirements on multiple dwellings in New York City and not having them in the other counties of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.866" offset="2886823">We're talking here about a very slight $5.00 a person differential which the legislature which as I've said it has to be presumed to be aware of the specific local conditions, so fit to provide as a benefit to compensate for the higher social cause of urban living which the New York City welfare recipient has to endure.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.885" offset="2978879">The question here is this Court said is whether the grounds adopted by the legislature are wholly irrelevant to the states objective and the -- unless the Court can say that they are also wholly irrelevant then it plainly has to reverse it appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.308" offset="3032586">Now lets look at the grounds, these grounds are specific and factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.989" offset="3047320">They're not policy grounds and yet in Dandridge, this Court so fit to declare that the maximum family rule in Maryland which created a real difference, a sizeable difference in the amount of welfare benefits received by individuals depending on whether or not they were in a large family.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.858" offset="3118791">It held that that was a permissible exercise of Maryland's legislative discretion based solely on Maryland's policy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.083" offset="3155675">Now here we don't have policy, we have actual -- factual material.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.501" offset="3173334">For example, we have the rent control and the actual lower rents within the New York City which I've already alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.598" offset="3197785">In addition as the record shows and the studies on housing within New York City show because of rent control and because of the antiquity of much of the housing in areas where welfare recipients have large to live, there's been an enormous deterioration in the quality of that housing and realistically, the legislature was entitled to find that this entails the purchase of items necessary to maintain this deteriorated housing which might not exist in suburban area.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.361" offset="3312828">In addition, you have the crime rate within New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.390" offset="3324949">Now, the statistics again within the record and set forth in our brief show that the amount of crimes and the amount of violent crimes specifically are far higher within New York City per capita.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.491" offset="3369357">And once again, the legislature has to be presumed to be aware of these factors and it has to be presumed to be aware that the higher crime rate which unfortunately strikes people the hardest who live in the areas, getaway areas, and low income neighborhoods were welfare recipients for the most part of obliged to reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.548" offset="3449605">This necessitates taken a taxicab home at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.655" offset="3462040">It necessitates buying lots, replacing stolen goods, replacing stolen monies, replacing stolen welfare checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.687" offset="3494118">It's true that New York City does permit stolen welfare checks to be replaced if they're reported but certainly not every stolen welfare check is reported and stolen goods and monies undoubtedly are not reported in the majority of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.043" offset="3547512">Window gates and bars and other devices that are necessitates by a high crime rate are simply effective life for New York City slum dweller.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.544" offset="3581576">And its no doubt debatable whether the legislature should give more money within its standard of need to compensate the New York City welfare recipient for these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.359" offset="3620760">But once we concede that its debatable then the Equal Protection Clause doesn't apply and its simply becomes a matter of what the three-judge court below did in our judgment namely substituting its views on policy for the legislature's discretion in coping with the realistic problem before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.034" offset="3691499">What this Court characterized in Dandridge as the, I'm paraphrasing the Court, but the extraordinarily difficult problem of apportioning or puzzling out to welfare recipients all of whom obviously need whatever the state can afford to give him.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.084" offset="3747715">Precisely how much this state can give this one and that one and here we repeat the differential was extremely slight compared to the family maximum which this Court sustained in Dandridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.198" offset="3792123">Another fact which the legislature -- since it enacted this factor had to be aware of with the sales tax and New York City has a 6% sales tax, 3% state, and additional 3% imposed by the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.038" offset="3843532">In Nassau, the 3% state sales tax applies to statewide of course but in Nassau County, the county tax is only 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.617" offset="3873834">In Westchester County except for one city, the City of Yonkers, there's no county tax at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.984" offset="3895359">These means and if -- in the other suburban counties, there's no county tax or city tax at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.963" offset="3919182">These means that on items other than food which welfare recipient has to buy clothing, household appliances, and the like to the extent that this additional 3% vis-à-vis Westchester County resident or 1% vis-à-vis Nassau County residents sales tax applies that in it of itself makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.716" offset="3998281">I refer the Court in our brief to the fact that the internal revenue service in its tax forms for the year 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.373" offset="4028897">So fit to recognize that for a family with an income between $3,000.00 and $4,000.00 a year which is the income of family of four on welfare in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.010" offset="4063378">The sales tax allowable under the suggested permissible allowances for a sales tax deduction on income tax is $92.00 for New York City for that family of four at that income level and only $46.00 in Westchester County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.633" offset="4121893">Now, right there you've got a $4.00 a month differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.165" offset="4135999">Now, we are not suggesting that this is necessarily binding on a legislature or that they have to abide by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.386" offset="4160867">But once we can see that it is debatable point then we've left the Equal Protection Clause far behind and we're in the area of legislative discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.002" offset="4379355">We -- weren't aware of this administrative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.890" offset="4390954">The letter sent by the Regional Commissioner of HEW, Mr. Collison to Commissioner Wyman back in November said that while there was a differential and they questioned that differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.495" offset="4417390">They said that to the extent that it could be demonstrated that courts were different between New York City and the other counties, that differential would be alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.505" offset="4461380">Now, Commissioner Wyman didn't reply of the letter of regional commissioner because the pendency of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.466" offset="4493249">The commissioner invited, Commissioner Wyman, to indicate what the factual basis where for the slight differential in favor of New York City welfare recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.327" offset="4528671">And as I've said because of the pendency of this litigation, Commissioner Wyman didn't reply and that's where the matter lay until last week when I got the Government's brief and I was interested to learn that they have a consistent administrative policy in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.740" offset="4582379">This was fascinating because not only has New York City paid a different amount over the years long before the adoption of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.021" offset="4611427">They had as we've been indicated three separate areas within the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.415" offset="4649044">I should say the State of Maryland pays people in Baltimore $10.00 a month more and as we discovered in our research and set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.193" offset="4680182">The State of California has a whole crazy quilt of amounts paid it varies with the contribution of the county wants to make and their enormous differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.499" offset="4717380">And of course, once we look beyond state boarders and we start looking to what happens between one state another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.092" offset="4739741">Then the difference has become enormous and without even discussing the differences in wealth they are paid between the states like New York and the southern states, right on the northeastern states where the standard of living is about the same on the states that you pass through taking the train from New York to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.724" offset="4810271">You'll see that the level of payments in Wilmington, Delaware with the standard of living can't be very different from New York City or Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.248" offset="4840364">The welfare payment is about half what it is in New York City and Philadelphia it's a lot lower than this in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.626" offset="4865860">So, since the federal government and specifically the Department of Health Education and Welfare is the agency that's suppose to administer all these and try to make assemblance of order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1478.304" offset="6016606">But when you look at the reasons for the slight differential in favor of New York City, we see that the legislature in fact have valid reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.362" offset="6052864">It had the deterioration of housing, the higher crime rate, the higher sales tax, and one which was testified to by the commissioner which I didn't get to yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.323" offset="6088704">And namely the fact that the best bulk, the overwhelming preponderance of welfare monies are paid under the AFDC Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.919" offset="6119006">And that means that most welfare recipients in New York as in other states are children and the -- where the social cost of urban living hits home is to the child on AFDC living typically in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.804" offset="6170624">Unfortunately, in a tenement of and in areas remote from a park as our brief indicates there are huge areas in Bronx County particularly which has a high number of welfare recipients where there simply no folk around from miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.907" offset="6219003">This necessitates the parent taking the child on public transportation and bringing him to a park or to the zoos in museums and aquariums and other facilities, beaches which are available to the -- in New York City, and which a part of urban living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.728" offset="6278248">Now in the suburbs, we're not about to suggest that life in the suburbs where an AFDC child is rosy but there's more room around and the legislature had a right to find that a child on welfare in Nassau or Westchester County is a lot more right to have some kind of a vacant lot around than a child in tenement and hold them with the self Bronx.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.260" offset="6364453">And for this -- and also the zoos and beaches and so on which existed in New York City are simply inaccessible in Nassau County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.845" offset="6394755">So, this is another item which the legislature and its discretion had a right to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.946" offset="6739153">This -- their existence adequate ground from the differential, but we note that the three-judge court didn't look at that way at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.204" offset="6764231">They bypassed the statutory and regulatory ground and they -- as we've indicated they veered toward the constitutional ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.470" offset="6825253">But we submit that a remand for the purpose of considering the statutory and regulatory ground wouldn't served any useful purpose here because the scope or the ambit of discretion within which the state legislature was allowed under that test seems to be about the same as the Government in effect says in its brief as under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.601" offset="7845804">And it -- and I should add the determination that the commissioner made in which he reduced the size of the disparity to approximately half.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.143" offset="12919933">Answer:"No, reason to be otherwise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.291" offset="12932577">Question:"Are you aware of the daycare centers for children in Nassau County?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.472" offset="12953266">Question:"They are all -- there are some and there are daycare centers for children in Westchester County?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.475" offset="12973223">"And for those people who need to use them are transportation costs involved?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.712" offset="12990255">"To the extent that the transportation system's costs more than New York City, the cost is more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.950" offset="13011153">The evidence had already showed that the transportation cost more in Nassau?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.717" offset="13022229">Answer:"That is correct."</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.835" offset="13030693">What took place in this case and what is taken place in this case is that the legislature is seen fit to declare a different standard of need to provide a differential which allows for transportation cost of some sort to the welfare center, to daycare centers, to beaches in New York City and not to do that in Nassau and not to do that in Yorkers, not to do that in Poughkeepsie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.845" offset="13122748">We would assert on the equal protection issue as a basis of minimal rationality and I know to this Court that the Court below decided not simply on the express special scrutiny standard which was rejected in Dandridge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.570" offset="13525661">They go on to state this which is really at the heart of the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.669" offset="13546036">They go on to state that this demonstrates the state legislature's concern for the ability to pay of various welfare districts and stay would be required to pay one quarter of any increase over the establish levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.078" offset="13599640">I think that what's going on this case Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.422" offset="13609044">I think they're right in what they say there that the legislature was concern with the ability of upstate localities to pay their one quarter of the welfare share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.236" offset="13652302">If one looks into the HEW regulations and the HEW materials that problem is exactly the problem which the uniformity regulations are aimed at and were aimed that from 1935 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.225" offset="13704234">It's a very old regulation we're talking about here and the reason they were aimed at this problem from 1935 on is that the general characteristic of public welfare in the United States prior to the Social Security Acts passage in 1935 was that each local county throughout the state paid exactly what they please whether they pay full need, half need, no need, a variation was absolutely enormous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.075" offset="13811649">This was one of the major problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.137" offset="13819904">The reason of variation was enormous was that welfare standards were dependent upon the localities willingness to raise the taxes in many localities a great problems as HEW's properly interpreted the requirement that the states financially participate in each locality throughout the state that requirement means that the state must financially participate through the extent necessary to relieve a locality of any problem it has in meeting a uniform schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.447" offset="13941112">The state must put in enough money to make sure that a uniform schedule was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.755" offset="13962428">Now, if New York State is permitted to retreat on this issue will allow localities to have a local -- to have a lower standard because of the problems they have in raising taxes and New York has decided that they cannot pay one quarter of the total share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.350" offset="14024808">We are taking a very long step back to the pre-1935 situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.975" offset="14043303">This is what motivated the HEW regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.362" offset="14412779">Therefore, there's lower rent in New York City than some of other counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.995" offset="14431378">Therefore, the amount of money given in the special rent grants to New York City welfare recipients is last than that given to welfare recipients in the other counties.</text>

            <text syncTime="4153.908" offset="16718973">I think these questions are related.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.613" offset="16725870">I'll try to answer it more fully now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.196" offset="16740185">We -- there are two contrasting situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.863" offset="16750843">Contrasting situations number one which is what we alleged took place here is the creation of two separate standards for people in parts, two parts of the state, one part put on a lower basis without any relation to actual cost than another part.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.867" offset="16806849">Situation number two which may also raise a uniformity question would arise where one uniform standard is created throughout the state eventhough it is quite clear that in one part of the state that uniform standard is totally insufficient to meet the items or base the cost the of items of basic need which it does need because of the actual cost situation in another part of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.574" offset="16917713">We suggest that it's consistent with the principle of uniformity to average costs and apply a uniform standard statewide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.631" offset="16945925">HEW has said out of experience that costs outside of rent just don't really basically differ within most states and therefore some objective showing would be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.671" offset="16986049">But if an objective showing is made that cost really different, different in a very significant extent and the uniform state standard is not arrived at by an averaging principle but simply by taking the lower place as the standard and subjecting the people who lived in the very high cost place to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.645" offset="17053968">Then I think there would be a uniformity issue raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.353" offset="17064835">Now, Your Honor in terms of the soundness of the legislative policy involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.579" offset="17089703">I think that is an issue in the first instance for the United States Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.541" offset="17105586">And it seems to me that with 35 years of a Social Security Act which is administered by HEW has followed the uniformity principle the United States Congress may be said also to follow this uniformity principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.053" offset="17163577">And this principle is critical.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="4294.973" offset="17283218">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.005" offset="17295444">I gather we will be going over until tomorrow and so for now, I just want to say a few things rather briefly to get down what seem to me, seem to the United States to be the central features of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.906" offset="17363048">First, I think it is by now clear that the only issue in this case is a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.360" offset="17384782">A preliminary injunction whose effect I think has been dramatically over characterized by appellants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.832" offset="17410696">It is not a requirement to the state to appropriate funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.630" offset="17425847">It is not an injunction to the state to pay the injunction tells the State of New York strictly in the terms of Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court in Rosado.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.019" offset="17475480">If the state wishes to continue receiving federal funds then it must order its need standard in such a way that it is done on an objective rational basis which are submission is the requirement of federal law and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.154" offset="17555937">Second, I think again to clear out the point which has been raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.566" offset="17581641">It is fundamentally our belief and I will put it in probability terms which are all that are required here on preliminary injunction that the appellants have shown that in all probability New York State is applying two different standards of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.322" offset="17656665">One for New York City which includes the social class of living in a city, in transportation, in visits to museums, in beaches, and possibly laundry costs and a lot of costs, and a number other items and another standard of need for the rest of the state in which residents and the rest of the state cannot obtain those item or I should put it more correctly because welfare recipients may spend the money they received, however they wish have no allowance for those items no matter how badly they may need them even if they live in Ghetto and Yonkers or in Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.221" offset="17812250">There simple is no allowance for them for these items.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.856" offset="17826774">And it is the position of HEW that the standard of need is a standard of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.916" offset="17851016">Not a standard of money necessarily and that the obligation of the state is to determine for itself and they have great latitude in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.247" offset="17888319">What services are required it is a minimum for living in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.841" offset="17914755">When they determine what services are required then they may cost those services and they may do so as Mr. Sparer has just suggested on one of two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.233" offset="17956342">And they do so throughout the state taking an average of those costs throughout the state or they may do so on a regional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.441" offset="17989151">It may very well be that the average expense for Knox in New York is considerably greater than the average expense in Buffalo or certainly than the average expense in Malone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.247" offset="18028335">And the state would be entitled to take that into account and deciding how much to pay on those regions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.943" offset="18051114">But it must make provision that if it's going to provide that these things are available it must make provision for their availability on a statewide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.029" offset="18087476">And I think Mr. Chief Justice that really provides the answer to your rent question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.076" offset="18107643">New York has made the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.399" offset="18116942">I for myself would think it's a wise judgment although not necessary one that the costs of rent are so variable in different parts of the state that it would be unfair to treat them as on average.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.768" offset="18162395">And therefore, they treat them on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.130" offset="18175875">But in terms of the standard of need, what's important is that everyone in New York State has the right to rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.064" offset="18199594">But it doesn't matter whether you live in Buffalo or New York City or on Nassau County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.065" offset="18215581">You have the right to rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.292" offset="18224567">You could have it on average basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.162" offset="18231986">You could have it on individual cost basis but you have the right to that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.296" offset="18248600">What New York City is doing on this case, we submit is to say that only people who live in New York City have the right to go to the beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.712" offset="18278170">And only people who live on New York City have the right to an allowance for transportation and only people who live in New York City have the right to an allowance that might provide them some security or repair their dilapidated premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.848" offset="18326758">Those are the only rationales we've heard and those rationales do not meet federal requirement in uniformity.</text>
