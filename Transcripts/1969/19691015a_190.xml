            <label>Mr. Josiah E. Dubois, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="49.653" offset="301955">It's more or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.523" offset="309478">Now, this case involves convictions under Section 174 of Title 21 of the United States Code and Section 4704 (a), of Title 26 of the United State Code relating to two narcotic drugs specifically heroin and cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.383" offset="404877">Now, it's the contention of the petitioner that the presumptions contained in both of these sections of the code are unconstitutional, because they discourage the right of the defendant to remain silent, and specifically we rely heavily upon the two relatively recent decisions of this Court which are cited in the brief of petitioner, namely Griffin versus California and United States versus Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.371" offset="560880">Now without repeating in detail, all of the arguments contained in the brief, I would like to emphasize certain points for consideration of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.712" offset="606229">First, Section 174 of Title 21 of the United States code requires that the defendant know that narcotic drugs in question “to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="148.765" offset="698389">Now in the Government's brief, it is a claimed that it is rational to permit the jury in this case to infer that a person in possession of a relatively large amount of heroin, knows that it was illegally imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.241" offset="780309">And in making this argument, the Government's brief approach from, were then apparently ignores the charge of the District Court Judge in which the Judge said specifically and I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.140" offset="835897">Now obviously, there is no evidence in this case that this particular defendant knew that this cocaine and this heroin -- heroin excuse me, have been imported into the United States contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.028" offset="907473">District Court Judge and went on to say, the statute recognizing the impossibility approving knowledge in this cases and having in mind the welfare of the people which is a purpose of the food and drug act, says that all you have to do, all the Government has to do is show that there was possession of this drug by the defendant on trial and that evidence shall suffice to authorize a violation of the statute unless by the witnesses presented possession of the drugs by this defendant under those circumstances will satisfactory explain to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.305" offset="1084583">It is abundantly clear therefore that under the instructions from the District Court Judge, the jury did not indulge in any rationalization such as that contained in the Government's brief, namely, the jury under the judge's instructions certainly did not indulge in the presumption that because there was a large amount of heroin that therefore the defendant knew it was illegally imported because the judge told the jury, all you have to find gentleman is possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.270" offset="1252498">So, I feel that the whole argument in the Government's brief concerning the so called rational interest, the mere to be drawn by jury, by the possession of this large amount of heroin is completely immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.366" offset="1320835">Secondly, the Government's brief and supplemental memorandum spend a great deal of time in pointing out that heroin is neither produced in the United States nor legally imported into the United State.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.063" offset="1391574">Now, even assuming we stipulate this fact, it is our position that this statement leads to nowhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.128" offset="1427832">Certainly, if this is true, I never knew it before reading the Government's brief and there is certainly is no evidence in this case that the defendant knew this to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.843" offset="1478719">In fact as I've already indicated, the District Court Judge specifically charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.800" offset="1506617">Now obviously, there is no evidence in this case that this particular defendant knew that this cocaine and heroin had been imported into the United State contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.336" offset="1556668">Now, my next point is --</text>

            <text syncTime="374.271" offset="1600449">Yes, so far as under the Section 174 of Title 21, the Government did concede the cocaine, of course I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.054" offset="1635558">Yes.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="383.330" offset="1636707">Was this part of your argument that now?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="josiah_e_dubois_jr" startTime="385.424" stopTime="625.309">
            <label>Mr. Josiah E. Dubois, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="385.424" offset="1645066">Yes, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.444" offset="1653112">Now, it is our contention that the presumption than mere possession of narcotics drugs is sufficient evidence of the violation of Section 174 of Title 21 requiring that the defendant know the drugs have been imported contrary to law is unconstitutional to use the words of the Griffin case, it cuts down on the privilege by making the assertion of the right to remain silent coarsely and to use the words of the Jackson case, it shows the assertion of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.895" offset="1806921">Now, it is to be noted that in the Jackson case, the defendant pleaded not guilty and demanded a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.488" offset="1845373">But this Court do said that the provision in the Federal Kidnapping Act that permits him to get descent if he ask for a jury trial was unconstitutional because it shows his right not -- to plead not guilty and to ask for a jury trial, and we say that the right to remain silent is just as precious as the right to demand a jury trial and the right to plead not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.251" offset="1972328">Now, with respect to the convictions under Section 4704 (a) of Title 28 of the United States Code, here again is a contention of the petitioner that the presumption contained in this section of the code or vying that mere possession of the drugs is prima facie evidence of a violation of the section is unconstitutional, again because it discourages the right of the defendant to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.792" offset="2090506">It is to be noted and this is not brought out at least in the Government's brief that whereas the indictment under this section of the code charged the defendant with unlawful purchase, possession, dispensing and distributing of narcotic drugs, and whereas, the judgment of conviction resides possession as well as purchase in dispensing and distributing.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.177" offset="2196041">In fact, this section of the code does not make the possession of narcotic drugs a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.892" offset="2222895">Specifically said statute says that, it shall be unlawful to purchase, sell, dispense or distribute narcotic drugs except in the original stamp packing.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.721" offset="2266258">Then, the statute provides as I've indicated, the possession shall be prima facia evidence of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.517" offset="2293426">There is absolutely no evidence in this case that the defendant purchased, sold, dispense or distributed narcotic drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.817" offset="2330624">And here again, the charge of the District Court judge to me is almost conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.542" offset="2357582">He said to the jury so that in effect your problem, your principle problem here will be to determine whether or not certain qualities of heroin and cocaine which have been more in evidence in this case were in the possession of -- or under the control of the defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.464" offset="2449220">Here again, the jury was instructed in effect that so wrong as the defendant was found to be in possession of the drugs that was all that was needed, and here again, the jury obviously must determine guilt solely on the basis of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.534" offset="2517556">So, in closing, we say that the presumptions in both of these sections of the statute are unconstitutional and we believe that the decisions of this Court in the Griffin case and the Jackson case dictate that this presumption be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.681" offset="2586102">Thank you very much.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Steven R. Rivkin</heading>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="625.309" stopTime="635.087">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Steven R. Rivkin</label>
            <text syncTime="635.087" offset="2643675">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.023" offset="2655483">There are other issues in this case beyond the issue of self incrimination arising from the statutory presumptions on which the petitioner for -- the petitioner has rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.807" offset="2698637">Because of the presence of these issues, I have filed in behalf of the amicus two briefs in this case and I would now like to make this brief supplementary argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.054" offset="2739597">I want a dwell on the issue that was preserved in the Leary case last term, the resolution here, the constitutionality under the due process clause of the statutory presumption in 21 USC Section 174 with respect to hard narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.598" offset="2801768">Then time permitting, I would like to point briefly to the other arguments post in the briefs of the amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.746" offset="2830399">The Leary case invalidated the virtually identical statutory presumption in 21 USC 176 (a) similarly involving a statutory influence arising from mere possession of foreign importation and knowledge thereof with respect to marijuana and it has specifically left for a future case separate consideration of the similar question with respect to hard drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.465" offset="2929246">Subsequent to the Leary case and in response to the briefs filed in this case, the Government has conceded error with respect to the drug cocaine and has prayed for reversal on count three.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.378" offset="2976893">By so doing, it is our position that the Government has now dissolved any line remaining after Leary between marijuana and hard drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.520" offset="3013465">Applying the task of that and prior cases to the drug heroin, the remaining drug in the petitioner's possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.172" offset="3044080">21 USC Section 174 is embraced fully within the prohibition of the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.101" offset="3075741">This Court has always given deference to the ability of Congress to fashion evidentiary rules but that deference has always been based and set forth in the Top case on the congress's ability to see the facts of a particular case in broader relationship than that might -- that might be presented to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.078" offset="3151705">It should be noted at the outset here, that what the Congress was doing in 1909 when it passed the import and export act with respect to narcotic drugs was working a total prohibition on the import and under domestic possession and use of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.222" offset="3212309">It was not making a judgment of a common relationship of facts such as the Congress was doing in the statute which was involved in Gainey case and the Romano case 26 USC 5601 in which it was determining that because of the tendency of steels to be located in hidden places, that they are maybe assumed to be in relationship with regard to anyone who is found present thereat.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.534" offset="3317530">Therefore, realizing that we must look behind the normal deference which is to be accorded to the Congress in these matters, we must apply to these presumptions the tests which have been most recently stated in Leary and which have been also stated in Tot, those tests are that there be a rational connection between the fact and evidence and the fact presumed there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.276" offset="3416482">Based on a connection and common experience and capable of giving rise to substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from fact and evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.728" offset="3462248">If we apply this tests to the possession here in question both logically and empirically with respect to 21 USC 174, we must come to a conclusion that we cannot reach substantial assurance that there is a rational connection between the fact in evidence and the facts unlawful importation and knowledge thereof which the Congress would have the Courts presume.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.151" offset="3571963">With respect to unlawful importation, there are at least four alternatives for the source of heroin in the possession of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.240" offset="3608325">This morning, Mr. Straus made reference to the statute 21 USC Section 513 by which heroin and any other drug may in fact be lawfully imported to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.580" offset="3657644">Lawfully imported for scientific purposes and for subsequent license, but I would want that if petitioner Turner and any other possessor of heroin had come in possession of such a drug without such a license, he could not be prosecuted under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.430" offset="3725040">The second source would be lawful importation of source material and subsequent deviation and manufacture of that source material into heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.967" offset="3763284">The source material commonly acknowledged for heroin derived as it is ultimately from the opium poppy is raw opium and morphine.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.633" offset="3797870">As I pointed out in my brief, there is also evidence which the Government does not contradict, indeed it confirms that codeine may also be a source for heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.425" offset="3849070">Using the Government's statistics which the Government has applied as the basis for concluding in this case that cocaine may in fact not be unlawfully imported to the United States, we come to a conclusion that there is a rather high potential of domestic manufacture of the heroin drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.048" offset="3923571">The Government concedes both the possibility and the technical ease with which heroin maybe manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.702" offset="3950216">The Government's reports mentioned efforts to manufacture heroin and moreover, the Government, both federal and state have attempted to prosecute people for the effort of manufacturing heroin from source materials otherwise present in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.053" offset="4011551">Moreover, the recent concerns of the bureau of narcotics and drug abuse for cough syrups which have raw traces of codeine within them and for Paragor which contain opium suggest that the source material for the substance in the possessor of heroin's hands maybe as handy as the local supermarket or drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.231" offset="4096293">The third element which I would suggest is present to vitiate the assurance of unlawful importation is that the opium poppy may have been grown in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.419" offset="4141014">Indeed, that prospect was itself the basis on which Congress passed the Narcotics Control Acts in the early part of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.522" offset="4173511">The Government has acknowledged that it is agriculturally possible to grow opium in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.807" offset="4202559">Moreover, there is a regime of federal control and licensing over the opium poppy in the United States and there have been prosecutions reported which are cited in my brief for individuals who have attempted to grow that product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.799" offset="4262536">The Government moreover in its brief has also confirmed that there are instances where opium is grown today in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.774" offset="7090448">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.244" offset="7104345">Petitioner stands convicted after a jury trial on four counts of narcotics violation and he petitioned this Court to review the constitutional validity as applied to him of the so called statutory presumptions of the two federal narcotics laws under which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.061" offset="7191594">The question of the constitutionality of the presumptions was the only question he put before the Court of Appeals and was the only question in the petition for certiorari and in our view of the case under this Court's rules therefore, no other issues are raised apart from the validity of the presumptions and that is what we have directed our brief to and what I anticipate directing the argument to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.897" offset="7299009">Because no other issues are raised, the facts of record pertinent in this Court are few but I think they are worth reviewing for purposes of addressing ourselves to the trial judges charge to the jury as well as to the validity of applying the presumptions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.449" offset="7393155">Federal narcotics agents arrested the petitioner and two traveling companions at a Lincoln tunnel tow booth in New Jersey shortly after their automobile emerged in the course of the trip from New York City and the automobile was registered in petitioner's name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.102" offset="7467760">While the agents were conducting a search of the arrested individual and prior to their actual search of petitioner's person, he threw a metal foil package containing cocaine to the top of the nearby wall and in search of the automobile then revealed another metal foil package containing heroin under the front seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.522" offset="7573504">The first package weighed 14 and 2/3 grams and contained a mixture of cocaine and sugar, 5% of which was cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.127" offset="7623868">The package containing heroin weighed 48 and a quarter grams and consisted of a mixture of several substances, 15.2% of which was heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.279" offset="7676531">The heroin mixture was divided into 275 small glisten double bags all wrapped within the metal foil package and none of the containers had any tax stamps affixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.117" offset="7739852">On the basis of this evidence, the petitioner was convicted of a heroin violation and of a cocaine violation under each of the two statutes set forth at pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.907" offset="7802964">Under Section 174 of Title 21, he was convicted of having knowingly received, concealed and facilitated the transportation of each drug after its illegal importation with knowledge that it had been illegally imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.623" offset="7873912">Under Section 4704 (a) of Title 26, he was convicted of having knowingly purchased, possess and distributed each drug not in or from the original stamp package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.136" offset="7923963">He was given concurrent sentences of imprisonment under two heroin counts to run consecutively with concurrence sentences under two cocaine counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.424" offset="7981119">Under each of these statutes, the Trial Court instructed the jury in the statutory language that under Section 174, excuse me, it was authorized to convict if the defendant was shown to have been in possession of the drug and has not explained his possession to the jury's satisfaction and under Section 4704, it was authorized to convict if the drug were shown to be in the defendant's possession without appropriate tax stamps affixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.691" offset="8126151">These so-called statutory presumptions authorized but did not require the jury the infer the additional elements of each crime from the Government's proof in this case and the issue before this Court is whether it was constitutionally permissible to apply these presumptions to each of the four counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.008" offset="8219355">The issue is not a novel one in this Court because the constitutionality of each of these statutory presumptions has previously been upheld in this Court's decisions, that of Section 174 in Yee Hem against the United States in volume 268 US and that of Section 4704 (a) in Casey against the United State in volume 276 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.148" offset="8335966">In a series of more recent decisions beginning with Tot against the United States and continuing through Gainey and Romano and most recently last terms decisions in Leary, the Court has more searchingly analyzed and refined the standard for determining the constitutional validity of criminal statutory presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.606" offset="8433768">A consistent theme of all of these decisions is that a distinction may legitimately be made between the evidence relating to a particular defendant and the question of what inferences in general may properly be drawn from the proof of certain facts and that as to the latter issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.223" offset="8536273">Congress may properly bring to bear its resources and its wisdom may bring to bear what this Court in Gainey referred to as the capacity of Congress to amass the stop of actual experience and call conclusions from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.404" offset="8612968">So as to provide statutory guides that will contribute to consistency in the administration of justice and that will in most cases enable the trial to be focused on the evidence relating to the particular defendant without the destruction and the burden of introducing proof in every case concerning complex matters of general application such as the details amass in the briefs in this case about the narcotics trade in general and its possible relation to the scientific properties of various drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.862" offset="8786840">Now of course, Congress has not foreclosed either party from introducing expert testimony or other evidence tending in general to vitiate or to substantiate statutory presumptions but this is rarely done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.585" offset="8937723">In the series of cases I mentioned, this Court has developed the standard for testing the constitutionality of criminal statutory presumptions in terms whether there is a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed or as it was re-stated last term in Leary, a criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as irrational or arbitrary and hence unconstitutional unless it can be at least said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.398" offset="9100936">Under this standard, we contend as to three of the counts here that the application of the presumptions was rational and as to the remaining count under which petitioner was convicted, we can see that this requirement was not match and that petitioner's conviction under that count should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.789" offset="9314513">And the statutory presumptions are just another form of recognizing that circumstantial evidence can be put to the jury under proper reasonable doubt instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.170" offset="9904044">We further urge that except as it may serve to raise a belated challenge to the Trial Court's instructions, petitioners rely on some the privilege against self incrimination in challenging the presumptions should be regarded in this case as not really adding anything to the established rational connection task of their validity and since we also contend that the jury instructions were adequate, we conclude that the verdict of guilty should be sustained as to the three counts in which the statutory presumptions were rationally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.615" offset="10061824">Returning first to the two heroin counts, we contend that both statutory presumptions were validly applied to the evidence of possession of that drug, under Section 174, it was rational for the jury to conclude from petitioners possession of the 275 bags of heroin, both that the heroin was illegally imported and the petitioner knew of its illegal importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.671" offset="10182092">We have documented in our brief and in our supplemental memorandum the reasons why in contrast to the facts concerning marijuana which were before this Court last term in Leary, on the basis of the best information available, available within the Government, available in scientific publications, available on the reports of the United Nation's Commission on narcotic drugs and available in the recent report of the task force on narcotics and drug abuse of the president's commission on law enforcement and administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.925" offset="10355022">The first part of this presumption that the heroin was illegally imported should be regarded as simply reflecting the actuality that heroin is neither produced in, or illegally imported into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.808" offset="10430568">We have in that written presentation carefully considered and responded every speculative possibility commendably suggested by counsel for the amicus in this case as an alternative source to illegal importation and we have demonstrated that none of these alternatives could realistically account for more than a negligible fraction of the total supply of heroin in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.545" offset="10545507">To the best of our knowledge virtually all and at least 99% of the heroin in the United States was illegally imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.389" offset="10584900">It then follows in the words of the Leary opinion as a matter of common sense that since all heroin is illegally imported or virtually all, a jury may rationally infer and thus maybe authorized by congress to infer that a person in possession of 275 bags of heroin knows that it was illegally imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.187" offset="10692106">The drawing of such inference by the jury from the conduct of the accused and the circumstances of the case is after all the ordinary way in accusatorial system of justice in which it is determined whether the accused have the requisite knowledge or other mental attributes such as specific intent when such a mental attribute is an element of a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.913" offset="12019022">But in any event, as the Chief Justice indicated in his reference to the principle that possession of the fruits of crime recently after his commission justifies an influence that the possession is guilty possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.236" offset="12084328">But knowledge is frequently of it inferred from the circumstances of the case in situations comparable to that contemplated by this statute and this is widely done in both state and federal law, for example in the enforcement of the national motor vehicle fastback, the so called direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.095" offset="12191744">And in the words this Court used in Gainey for Congress to authorized the jury to do this is to authorize it to do no more than accord to the evidence if unexplained, its natural prohibitive force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.109" offset="12263842">We also contend that the presumption in the tax stamp statute was validly applied to petitioner's possession of the heroin since as we have documented in our brief, heroin is not available in tax stamp packages, there is no way petitioner could have procured it in or from the original stamp package and it follows that Congress constitutionally could authorize the jury to infer from his possession of the heroin that he had purchased it in violation of the tax stamps statute which in contrast to Section 174 does not include specific knowledge as an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.869" offset="12438862">As to the cocaine counts, we first concede that the application of the Section 174 presumption to petitioner's possession of the relatively small amount of cocaine involved in this case was not warranted under the constitutional standard, explained and applied last term in Leary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.329" offset="12520678">This is because in contrast to heroin, there are as indicated in our brief and its appendix, substantial quantities of cocaine stolen from legitimate sources in this country every year while comparison of these figures with the admittedly rough estimates set forth in the footnote on page 31 of our brief of the quantities of cocaine annually smuggled into this country might justify an inference that the cocaine found in the elicit trade was in fact was illegally imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.568" offset="12665605">We do not believe that the further inference of knowledge of its illegal importation meets the Leary standard in such a case as the present one involving less than ¾ of a gram of cocaine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.929" offset="12903111">Either alternative would accomplish the same thing presumably and I think either would be an acceptable procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.722" offset="12962252">So, we do not contend that this conviction met the Leary standard but in conceding this, we do contend that this Court need not and should not now decide whether the Section 174 presumption could validly be applied to possession of cocaine in an amount so large as not reasonably likely to have been aggregated from individual thefts or in other circumstances pointing to a foreign source, there is no necessity in this case to decide whether the presumption can ever bail or it be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.235" offset="13128286">We urge on the other hand that the tax stamp presumption was validly applied to position -- to petitioner's possession of the cocaine and the circumstances of this case as we've elaborated in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.920" offset="13195055">Turning now to petitioner's claims based on the privilege against self incrimination, we recognize that when a statutory presumption is applied without adequate rational foundation as we concede was the case as to one count here, one way of articulating the constitutional infirmity is to say that so applied, the presumption impermissibly impaired the defendant's right to remain silent and thus violated his Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.922" offset="13327026">When however such a presumption is applied in compliance with the standard of rationality established by this Court, then the alleged coercion to testify stands not from any unconstitutional compulsion but from the legitimate force of the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.850" offset="13406751">It is not uncommon in a criminal trial for the defendant to be faced with evidence justifying a rational inference of guilt and to have to decide whether despite attended risks of doing so, he will testify an effort to overcome the force of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.253" offset="13480417">There is no reason relevant to the policies of the privilege against self incrimination for holding that the status of such a defendant differs depending on whether the jury's inference of guilt is authorized by judge made rule of evidence or by a rationally warranted statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.481" offset="13569337">In either instance as the Gainey opinion recognized, the Courts have the same responsibility to decide whether the Government has made a submissible case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.169" offset="13612074">And if the Government's evidence meet that standard and we contend it did hear with respect to three counts, submission of the case to the jury does not violate the constitutional privilege as this Court definitively held in Yee Hem against the United States, and the passage quoted on page 36 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.827" offset="13710712">Turning finally to the instructions to the jury, although petitioner did not accept to them at the trial and did not request that the jury be charged not to draw any adverse inference from his failure to testify, he now contends that the reading of the statutory inferences to the jury in the course of the instructions constituted adverse comment on his silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.690" offset="13822098">Now, substantially the same contention was properly rejected by this Court in Gainey in which very similar instructions to the jury were upheld in a situation involving a similar statutory presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.896" offset="13882911">Now, its true that there are passages in the instructions which were read by counsel for the petitioner which have to be understood in the context of the trial in which the matter put in issue by the defense was the question of possession, that was what they were contesting at trial and naturally, the Trial Judge emphasized to the jury that that was a crucial issue for them to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.062" offset="13995656">But here as in Gainey, at reading the instruction as a whole, the jury was merely permitted to draw rational inferences from the unexplained circumstantial evidence presented by the Government and the jury was specifically admonished that they were to be the sole and exclusive judges of the facts and that the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was on the Government not withstanding the statutory presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.507" offset="14109445">While it might have been better practice as the Gainey opinion suggest to omit from the charge any explicit reference to the statutory provisions authorizing the inferences, the instructions as given were adequate specially in the absence of an exception and do not differ significantly from those upheld in Gainey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.914" offset="14207039">It is therefore our position that accept as to count three, this Court should affirm the judgment upholding the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.128" offset="14239848">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.259" offset="14276420">I just want to say Yee Hem and Casey decisions were decided before judge and reading the Yee Hem decision particularly that part called Government's brief and the judge's decision is different like day and night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.158" offset="14332008">Secondly, I would like to say that the argument here still seem to ignore the fact that the lower court judge said, obviously there is no evidence, that this defendant knew that this cocaine, heroin had been unlawfully imported and then he added that the statute recognizes the possibility of proving that, that's why he is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.846" offset="14422706">And thirdly, may I here to point out that as I did before that the section relating to stamps does not make possession a crime or the indictment contain the word possession and the conviction containing the word possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.082" offset="14491669">Thank you.</text>
