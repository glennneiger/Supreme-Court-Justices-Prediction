            <text syncTime="42.810" offset="274578">The appellant in this case have been charged in a proceeding prior to the one here at issue where the violation of the state narcotics law.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.653" offset="329958">In the course of that proceeding, his bond was raised on the prior charge and three policemen with capiases for his arrest in connection with the raised bond proceeded to what was believed to be his home and they did what they called stick themselves out and hid themselves near the home to watch it for some reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.616" offset="425880">They said they want to be sure he was home before they arrested him, I didn't quite understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.677" offset="446046">In any event, while they were waiting in hiding an automobile drove up in front of the appellant's home and it was driven by a man known to be a narcotics addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.096" offset="511770">The driver sounded his horn, appellant came out of the house, talked to the driver from the other side, the passenger side of the automobile, returned to his home, came out again, again talked to the driver and then the police made their presence known, surrounded the automobile, arrested the driver, he hastily put something into his mouth and presumably swallowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.477" offset="633292">The police assumed that what they called a transaction was taking place and the appellant himself turned and started to walk back into his home, they stopped him and arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.543" offset="701524">There are some variations in the testimony about how far he was from the door of his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.070" offset="727646">And I suppose, at one point I think it said he was at the front steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.291" offset="756485">At another, he was at the side of the car anywhere from 15 to 30 feet away.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.259" offset="772368">In any event, he was not inside the house when arrested and I think the best way to put it was that he was on the sidewalk in front of his home.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.541" offset="2397497">Now, some 200 years ago or more, William Pitt, the Elder in the House of Commons or the Earl of Chatham said, “The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.165" offset="2459982">It may be frail roof, may leak, the wind may blow through it, storm and the rain may enter, but the King of England may not enter all of his forces they are not cross the threshold.”</text>
            <text syncTime="601.090" offset="2507734">That's the -- I think the fundamental, the beginning of the principle which we not have embodied in the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.200" offset="2540126">And about that same era, the Lord Halifax was what was called in England one of the secretaries of state issued a general warrant for the arrest of the publishers of the -- seditious libel stated to have appeared in the North Briton.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.017" offset="2615463">On moving about the so-called messengers, I suppose equivalent to constables learned that it was John Wilkes who was the publisher of the libel and under that same general warrant namely him or any one else Wilkes was arrested, his house was ransacked, his papers were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.746" offset="2690382">They called the blacksmiths that broke the locks and so on and that he sued the messengers and others and Lord Halifax for libel or a rather for the unlawful issuance of unlawful writ and the seizure, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.597" offset="2781811">He recovered 1000 pounds against Lord Halifax, a lesser amounts against the others in a famous opinion written at that time by Lord Chief Justice Pratt and followed very shortly within the same few years, same decade by the famous case of John Entick who had been arrested and his papers all seized under a somewhat similar warrant except that it main him.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.413" offset="2901034">It was seditious libel in the British Freeholder and other publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.761" offset="2926425">And in that case, Lord Camden held that if this practice which had originated in the Star Chamber should be sanctioned, “the secret cabinets and bureaus of every subject in this kingdom will be thrown open to the search and inspection whenever the secretary of state shall see fit to charge or even suspect a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.583" offset="3013674">And this power so assumed there's an execution on all of party's papers, his house, his rifle; his most valuable papers are taken out and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.922" offset="3059022">And then may in his constitutional history of England that antique cases are uncovering perhaps 100 pages of fine print.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.237" offset="3092355">It's a long-winded thing but may in this constitutional history of England sums it up that with the unanimous concurrence of Lord Mansfield and the other judges of the court, this eminent magistrate now finally condemned this dangerous and unconstitutional practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.712" offset="3166229">Now very interestingly, just before those two famous English cases arose, a situation arose in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.042" offset="3211577">The British ministry set orders to issue general warrants which they were called writs of assistance to search for merchandise on which the duties imposed by parliament and not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.530" offset="3277511">There were no names, there were no places, they were simply suppose to go out and it gave them the right presumably to go into any warehouse shop or other place to search for these payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.524" offset="3333517">James Otis was the Attorney General of the Colony of Massachusetts under crown appointment at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.869" offset="3366849">He refused to support the writs, resigned his office, took employment on the other side without fee and fought the issuance of these writs from the Superior Court of Massachusetts, and the case was reported actually by John Adams whose notes of the case are published.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.353" offset="3440828">He said in the first instance that the court expressed great doubts of the legality of such a writ and of the authority of the court to grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.265" offset="3476459">And Otis said in his argument, “the writ prayed for in this petition, being general, is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.118" offset="3507806">It is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.966" offset="3527241">”Not more than one instance he went on and he talked about the case in the Star Chamber.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.559" offset="3553573">Now, these writs were never issued but at the conclusion of his notes, John Adams said, American independence was then and there born.”</text>
            <text syncTime="873.738" offset="3598294">At the end of his argument, I think this is very significant language, Otis said that special writs only may be granted on oath and probable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.042" offset="3659525">The acts of William at end are confined to this sense that an officer should show probable ground, should take his oath of it, should do this before a magistrate and that such magistrate if he think proper should issue a special warrant to search the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.894" offset="3726921">That language is almost copied for about 25 years later into the Fourth Amendment, it's perfectly astounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.754" offset="3754402">Now closely, that language that he used in the argument as reported by John Adams tracks or vice versa the language of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.Now, if this Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.025" offset="6895470">The State of Louisiana certainly agrees with everything that Mr. Deutsch has said about the inviolability of homes and the constitutional prohibition against the search of a house without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.278" offset="6952521">However, as the State of Louisiana sees this case, its issue is much narrow and sort of confined the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.088" offset="7043741">It might interest you that counsel for that effect is here a while ago and he told us that this can have Chimel?</text>

            <text syncTime="1747.063" offset="7091597">I think even as later as laid as young as decision in Chimel, it was taken to be settled jurisprudence of this Court that following a valid arrest, an incidental search can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.072" offset="7151679">Now, do I understand, has the State of Louisiana certainly argues that a valid arrest without warrant was made in this case or at the right at the front door of the house -- front steps of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.079" offset="7211656">We concede that it was not in the house, it was -- Vale was returning to his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.532" offset="7229524">Now, if a valid arrest was made, an incidental search contemporaneous with this arrest under the jurisprudence of this Court on incidental search was permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.888" offset="7286888">And as the State of Louisiana sees that the only issue before this Court is whether the scope of that incidental search was also permissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.393" offset="7484897">They were looking, the State of Louisiana concedes because it's from the record, the State of Louisiana has to concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.415" offset="7509034">The police officers testified that they were sure there were narcotics in that house from which James Vale was -- Donald Vale had going in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.445" offset="7545187">They were sure that was where his supply was that he would come out of that house and sell to the people who would come up to the house like Saucier in instance case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.805" offset="7578624">So they -- when they saw him go back in the house, come back in out without within minutes, looked up and down the street as he went down the steps and put his head in the car, and what they were convinced was a narcotic sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.498" offset="7641318">And then when they approached the house, an Saucier swallowed the narcotics and they frisked down Saucier and Donald Vale and found nothing on them, they testified that they were convinced that the source of those narcotics were in that house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.127" offset="7699832">So, there is no doubt about the issue in this case as the State of Louisiana sees it is a very narrow one was the scope of their search incident to Donald Vale's legal arrest constitutionally permissible in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.050" offset="7767542">That is there's no doubt about it that under the jurisprudence of this Court, they had the right following this valid arrest without warrant and from the house to frisked down Saucier and Vale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.101" offset="7815816">No doubt about that under the settled decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.846" offset="7834728">Now, the State of Louisiana and under the Chimel decision, the incidental arrest has been confined to the area within which the accused could reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.890" offset="7914977">Well, there's no doubt about it that the search in the instant case went beyond the area into which Donald Vale could've reach because it was inside the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.767" offset="7962415">Now, though it's Louisiana's position that this was an emergency situation and that it was impossible to get a search warrant -- impossible to get a search warrant in advance because they didn't know that they were going to be confronted with this emergency sale which took place before their eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.712" offset="8034200">They thought they were just going there to arrest this man on prior narcotics charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.165" offset="8056038">So, they couldn't have brought along a search warrant, there's no doubt about that.</text>
