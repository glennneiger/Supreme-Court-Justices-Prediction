            <label>Mr. Joseph Amato</label>
            <text syncTime="14.264" offset="160475">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.616" offset="297880">Honorable Chief Justice, Associate Justices, this is another case that we have here in a long history of cases that the United States Supreme Court has decided in the past regarding the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.998" offset="363395">That amendment reads as follows, “The right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”</text>
            <text syncTime="90.212" offset="464227">Certainly, this Court has treated the rights of private citizen in the past with great emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.830" offset="502680">Weeks versus United States has held that a search based upon reasonable cause is allowed incidental to arrest providing that that search is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.725" offset="558268">Before we go into long facts situation of this particular case, I think it should be pointed out that the petitioner in this case is alleging that his particular arrest which was an invalid arrest and then subsequently the police went on with an unreasonable search that this was a violation to his Fourth Amendment rights even prior to this Court's decision last year in People versus Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.600" offset="685746">Certainly, in this particular case, the petitioner appealed and opposed all information and all evidence regarding that particular case at the trial level, at the Court of Appeal, at the Supreme Court and now here before the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.667" offset="762023">The particular trial court at the time they were ruling on the evidence of particularly the diary which is really the relevant issue in this particular case because without the diary, the evidence is insufficient to convict the particular petitioner, that at the time the trial judge ruled upon the admissibility of the particular evidence and the diary that the trial judge made a statement that a ruling adverse to the prosecution would open Pandora's box to the particular evidence that was included in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.175" offset="908100">And what the Court meant, what the trial court meant at that time was not that this factual situation would open the Court, but this was opening such a vast exception to what this Court has ruled in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.215" offset="960240">It wouldn't fit, allow, and arrest, an arrest that was not a valid arrest, and this arrest of a mistaken person.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.452" offset="997230">And then to go from that arrest on to search the premises, to search for things that are not necessarily connected with the crime or the fruits of the particular crime the police were searching for.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.830" offset="1062640">Well, the Court of Appeal after taking --</text>

            <text syncTime="243.734" offset="1078314">Part of Chimel was carried backwards, then in this case, does this satisfy Chimel?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.643" offset="1121991">I believe we have a question that this comes within the rule of Chimel that the --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="261.527" offset="1149471">You mean it's invalid under Chimel?</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_amato" startTime="263.167" stopTime="421.246">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Amato</label>
            <text syncTime="263.167" offset="1156054">It's invalid under Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.741" offset="1162324">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.077" offset="1167653">I don't believe that this is the big issue in this particular case although I'm sure that the Court has granted certiorari on the basis of Chimel and the decision on whether to make it retroactive or not but the petitioner in this particular case had this go on the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.160" offset="1248005">The Court of Appeal of California reversed based upon the law of Rabinowitz and Harris and then the Supreme Court of California affirmed the conviction in using those same two cases as guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.496" offset="1309341">It would seem based on the factual situation in this case that what we have here is the petitioner absent from his residence that the police finding information out from co-companions this case as the Court is aware of involved four individuals robbing a particular house and then two of those individuals shortly thereafter, a day or two thereafter was captured by the police on an unrelated crime possession of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.835" offset="1438699">The police at that time had information from those particular police officers and the victims of the robbery itself also a bystander.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.891" offset="1490944">So it is not the petitioner's contention that there was not reasonable cause to arrest Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.553" offset="1513618">Clearly, there was but it is the petitioner's contention that the rights of privacy that this Court has constantly held is the rights of privacy of the house and not the fact that reasonable cause allowed a mistaken arrest to then give effect and authority to an unreasonable search.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.107" offset="1595852">First of all, the arrest itself was made which the -- excuse me, the petitioner contends in debatably good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.700" offset="1638170">First of all, there were four officers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.180" offset="1652067">Two of them carrying shot guns entered into the office of Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.789" offset="1670562">I should say the apartment of Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.465" offset="1681220">Miller was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.342" offset="1688743">Miller answered the particular door and immediately thereafter, the officers arrested Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.421" offset="1721031">Miller stated that he was not Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.559" offset="1733569">Miller gave identification showing that he was not Miller and then when the officers asked whether or not Miller or -- knew where Hill was, Miller replied no, that he did not know where Hill was.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="421.246" stopTime="439.782">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="421.246" offset="1788322">Well I'm not -- I'm not sure the significance of his disavowal or his claim that he was Miller and not Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.433" offset="1825102">That is not unusual for people engaged in this kind of business to carry false identity cards and a lot of other things, is that no so?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_amato" startTime="439.782" stopTime="537.506">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Amato</label>
            <text syncTime="439.782" offset="1862510">That is correct, Your Honor but I think from the standpoint, when you take all these factors, the fact that there was couple inches in discrepancy in the height, 10 pounds in the weight that that could be said that he was Miller and that he was in Hill's apartment that at this particular point in time, he showed identification that he was Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.839" offset="1934712">There's no information that the officers had prior to go into the residence of Hill that there was another person and there was no indication that Miller knew that the officers were coming in there or Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.434" offset="1985076">So the officers and I think the case cited in the friend of the court brief shows that the officers are required to use diligence and prudence when they arrest the particular person and most of these cases hold that when a person or officer does not use diligence that in fact is an -- a bad faith arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.958" offset="2095208">In one particular case cited by the friend of the court brief, it even held that particular officer liable in damages for an amount of $1,500.00 and in that particular dissenting opinion and I'm referring to Walton versus Will, 66 Cal. 2d 509, the dissenting opinion stated that in all respects the description of accused was either identical with or closely approximated that of respondent and that was a particular same name case.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.728" offset="2238255">In this situation, the names were not the same at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.289" offset="2252570">Archi --</text>

            <text syncTime="537.506" offset="2253406">Would you have expressed the language by the state courts officers though mistaken in their identification, (Inaudible)?</text>

            <text syncTime="548.115" offset="2295829">So you have to start with that practice; your argument also starts with that practice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Amato</label>
            <text syncTime="554.628" offset="2321847">Well, I think it starts from that premise from the standpoint --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="558.022" stopTime="559.276">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="558.022" offset="2335431">-- those findings.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_amato" startTime="559.276" stopTime="738.347">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Amato</label>
            <text syncTime="559.276" offset="2340446">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.580" offset="2345671">But I think in all these particular search and seizure cases that all the facts are important that this initial arrest should also be considered in light of the total search itself which the petitioner contends is unreasonable so then we go on to the search itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.752" offset="2422366">The search was directed towards the bedroom, a material search which disclosed a particular diary and some of the other fruits of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.137" offset="2463953">A diary is the area that the petitioner contends as totally unreasonable as far as the search is concerned and that it is totally inconsistent with Rabinowitz, with Harris or any other cases that this particular Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.143" offset="2531976">First of all, the officers had no way of getting the search warrant based upon the information they had regarding the diary.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.070" offset="2571682">The fact that they were able to search that particular residence and assuming they are allowed to search the drawers and rummage through the particular dresser drawers, this Court has always state in the past that because you have a lawful search does necessarily mean that you have a right to seize.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.992" offset="2659349">In the respondent's brief, it is indicated that they came across this particular diary in the search for other items and we're talking about cameras, we're talking about clothes and certain types of hoods that the particular suspects wore during the commission of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.158" offset="2752031">Even in People versus Harris which is probably the most liberal decision allowing the police to search, this Court held that not in all cases will they allow such an extensive search.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.847" offset="2814725">Certainly, in Harris they were looking for checks, two to $10,000.00 checks and by the nature of the search, by the nature of the things that they were looking for, it would require looking into a particular drawer or books or personal belongings.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.694" offset="2890167">But what information the officers had in this particular case did not require that type of search.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.008" offset="2919424">And if in fact they did and as concluded by this Court, that they made a reasonable search then it's submitted by the petitioner that it was an unlawful seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.879" offset="2966862">And Boyd versus United States has held that an unlawful search or an unlawful seizure are not dependent upon each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.541" offset="3021511">So certainly, the petitioner is strongly contending for that one item alone that it was an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="750.516" offset="3105416">I don't believe there's any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.242" offset="3112312">We have not raised issues that we don't think are extremely material and relevant or strong issues so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.928" offset="3139062">We have raised issues relevant to the arrest itself and the seizure itself and certainly we wanted the arrest itself, the fact that it wasn't the person that the officers were there to make sure that all the circumstances of the case were before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.412" offset="3229027">Certainly, it doesn't need dwelling on that Rabinowitz and Harris which the California Supreme Court relied on to affirm the conviction of the petitioner is totally different from the fact situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.582" offset="3301752">I already indicated this in my particular brief and I don't believe it needs elaboration on at this time but certainly we are emphasizing at this time that there is really no degree of consistency with the fact situation, the application of the Fourth Amendment in that case as compared to the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.411" offset="3445008">I would like to go to the second point and that's to the determination of whether or not this Court will make Chimel, People versus Chimel retroactive or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.923" offset="3499029">In this particular case, I think it directly comes into play another part, another exception, another area on the part of the prosecution to press their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.602" offset="3565798">I think it's another area that this Court could reverse in addition to the very initial contention the petitioners made.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.851" offset="3606758">And that is the fact that Chimel, People versus Chimel decided last year clearly limits the police to search a particular residence and while many questions have been raised as to how far the police are allowed to search certainly, this instance where the particular arrest was made in the living room or this Court hasn't cited that as not a material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.269" offset="3736430">Then the search was made beyond the immediate scope of the particular petitioner that I quote, “petitioner because in fact he was not even present that the arrest could not or search could not pursue into the living room, into drawers and in fact the general and exploratory search to find evidence of the crime.”</text>

            <text syncTime="973.682" offset="3998072">Now, insofar as retroactivity on this particular case, certainly, this Court has decided that it depends on a case by case basis, depending on the law, the actual effect that will have in the administration of justice and whether or not it will serve to a good effect on the past content of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.150" offset="4127953">Now, it is contended that the administration of justice will be strongly effective as a result of making Chimel retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.675" offset="4174033">The petitioner contends that this will not in fact be the case, that the courts are extremely flexible, and in the past, time and time again, the courts on major counties have been able to take some of their civil judges and utilize them for criminal manners and this happens on occasion even if when there is no strong decision from this Court changing the particular law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.353" offset="4292733">The petitioner strongly contends that making Chimel retroactive will not have that greater effect on the particular administration of justice from the standpoint of having a lot of criminals who've been unconstitutionally convicted are being released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.341" offset="4372773">Petitioners contended in his reply brief that surely the appeals that are pending now could easily affect the laws as this Court has enunciated in People versus Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.582" offset="4441736">It seems appropriate that when you review the cases regarding this particular problem in Alaska Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals in New Mexico that these cases have applied Chimel on direct appeals only and then when you review the cases you also see that they applied to these particular cases without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.468" offset="4545285">And when the cases are not utilizing Chimel on direct appeal that they seem to state what this Court has stated in Stovall versus California and the Desist case setting forth the three criteria that this Court strongly considers in their determination of whether or not a case in criminal law should be made retroactive or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.218" offset="4652283">But that the courts in fact have just come to a conclusion that when there is a constitutional finding before it that they review the facts as the law as it is in that pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.024" offset="4719470">And it doesn't have to be satisfied with the law of opinion or justification but that in fact it seems reasonable to those particular judges that this case should be made as the law has stated by this Court and that set some date that when a particular case, an arrest was made two to three years ago and have all those particular arrests, then based upon whether or not it was constitutional or not constitutional and that's immaterial because the date of the arrest to Chimel, the date of seizure, search and seizure is not the same date as specified in the pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.999" offset="4907342">This particular case was close to Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.015" offset="4931480">The petitioner contended at the time that the Court of Appeal that this was not a case where the law of Rabinowitz and Harris and I am referring back to the first issue if I may was not constitutionally sanctioned to search even at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.051" offset="5031581">So certainly insofar as Chimel is concerned which far limits the courts and far limits the courts in affirming the rights of the police officers to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.697" offset="5102111">It would be submitted by this petitioner that certainly Chimel should made retroactive at least that the case is on direct appeal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald M. George</label>
            <text syncTime="1274.609" offset="5201795">The sole issues in this case are whether the search of petitioner's one-bedroom apartment was lawful under then existing law, and secondly, if the search was not lawful under present law as defined by this Court's decision seven months ago in Chimel versus California whether Chimel is to be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.970" offset="5287267">The factual setting in which the lawfulness of the search arises is a rather unusual one and I therefore like to chronicle it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.534" offset="5325511">On June 4, 1966, a robbery involving a brutal assault was committed by a gang of four armed men, one of whom was petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.093" offset="5363754">As part of the series of robberies committed by this gang or we can say which this gang was suspected, in a particular district in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.122" offset="5411819">Two days later after this robbery, in the evening, the police acquired probable cause to arrest petitioner and this is conceded by petitioner in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.971" offset="5459257">I won't dwell upon the probable cause to arrest petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.532" offset="5473468">That's clear and as I said conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.616" offset="5485798">The police then proceed to petitioner's apartment in order to arrest petitioner and to retrieve the weapons used in the assault and robberies and in order to retrieve the disguises in stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.465" offset="5549223">In fact, this is done with the consent of one Bader who is one of the members of the gang, Bader and one other man have been placed in custody and Bader is petitioner's roommate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.108" offset="5607842">The police knock and identified themselves and they're confronted by somebody who later turns out to be Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.416" offset="5641070">Now, Miller is the sole occupant of the apartment at this time, and he opens the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.344" offset="5668760">He looks almost identical to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.572" offset="5685687">In fact, the discrepancies are almost negligible, brown hair, brown eyes, almost the same height and weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.445" offset="5717138">In fact, petitioner was two inches shorter, 5'10" instead of 6 feet and he was 10 pounds lighter as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.818" offset="5750680">But that is a negligible discrepancy and one that certainly isn't necessarily apparent to the officers or one that need not be apparent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.250" offset="7064325">Well, we have this fourth member of the gang back out who was still at large and he might be alerted by the fact that these three members were placed in custody and might remove the property before a search warrant could be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.396" offset="7120959">So, this is not the type of situation that Chimel criticizes where the officers routinely as a matter of course dispensed with the requirement of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.206" offset="7168188">Chimel itself is replete with language recognizing that there are situations where a search without a search warrant is justifiable and we would submit strongly that this is one of those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.389" offset="7220955">Now, this is an alternate argument because we urge very strongly that Chimel is not retroactive but in turn I feel that the search passes master under either Chimel or pre-Chimel law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.850" offset="9142732">Now, I think the principles involved in this case are graphically illustrated by considering the following hypothetical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.595" offset="9181706">Let's assume that Miller was arrested in petitioner's apartment but the petitioner was right there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.005" offset="9251401">Certainly, even under Chimel, the police could search the area within the reach of the visitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.171" offset="9284106">The officer need not decide, well this is really Hill's apartment here and I have to risk being shot by Miller who might grab a weapon, he has the right to a certain extent invade the privacy of the proprietor of these premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.704" offset="9354219">Now, question is why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.455" offset="9365191">Well, I think that there's a certain assumption of risk on the part of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.855" offset="9386820">Here, the petitioner talks about the risk that the invasion of the petitioner's privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.350" offset="9412733">Well, one takes a risk in inviting a visitor on the premises, just as one may risk tort liability if he falls over the carpet.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.128" offset="11775875">There are three federal circuits and five states that have held that Chimel is fully prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.413" offset="11801057">It applies only to searches conducted after the date of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.250" offset="11828328">In Alaska, New Mexico where the only jurisdictions that have decided to the contrary, we submit that Desist is the governable standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.522" offset="11869497">Desist set forth the function of the three considerations, the purpose to be served, the extent of reliance and the effect on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.008" offset="11907427">Chimel stresses in footnote 12 that the Fourth Amendment's purpose is to prevent not simply to redress unlawful police action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.144" offset="11939924">Well, I don't see how it would help deter illegal police conduct to punish in effect police and prosecutors who would justifiably relied on this Court's decisions of many years standing and conducted searches in total compliance with those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.383" offset="12012857">We're not talking about unreliable or false evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.906" offset="12022993">It's only a procedural question not affecting the issue the guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.820" offset="12042637">So in effect, and certainly the extent of reliance by law enforcement is clear, this Court two years before Chimel and one year after the present search in the Cooper case quoted that statement in Rabinowitz that has since been disapproved and I think it's significant that within three weeks of the decision in Chimel, 70% of the states joined respondents in a petitioning for rehearing and this shows the impact of this decision and it's been evident to me in going around explaining the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.878" offset="12174921">They regard this as a greater impact than Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.524" offset="12189445">They regard this as a greatest impact on their day to day enforcement techniques of any decision that has come down in the criminal field in recent years and the memorandum which is attached to this letter of the Los Angeles municipal court shows how that Court has had to completely revise its procedures and place judges on call nights and weekends to issue search warrants because of Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.108" offset="12291845">And we would submit that there would be an enormous impact on the courts in requiring them to retry a multitude of cases decided in reliance on Chimel and if there is any case in which this Court still believes that a new rule of constitutional law should be applied prospectively, this is certainly the case under the standards which this Court has held.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.149" offset="13280005">I think it will be justified from the standpoint of the parts that they set forth with clarity and it would extend to the diary which would be illegal at which if they brought in the diary it would be insufficient but as far as the evidence it would be alright as far as the courts are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.320" offset="13348655">Now, counsel brought out a fact that Bader who was in custody consented to the officers to go to the petitioner's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.024" offset="13399437">I think the California court simply stated in my reply brief that Bader who has held in custody does not have the authority to strip the petitioner of all of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.192" offset="13452100">And certainly because Bader said he could go to that particular apartment doesn't mean that he can go ahead, the officer can go ahead and search it and as far as the petitioner contends, an unreasonable search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.360" offset="13512808">Now, this point about this Bacca, B-A-C-C-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.011" offset="13543424">Now, Bacca was the third person who was not in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.340" offset="13560769">Meaning two of the defendants were in custody, the petitioner was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.099" offset="13579786">So the respondent says, there's a very big emergency here, “We can't go back and get a search warrant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.082" offset="13611656">Well, what is the emergency here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.056" offset="13619597">What we're talking about its four individuals, police officers, two shotguns would have already arrested Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.142" offset="13651989">Now, we have in fact if they thought it was Miller then they have three of the four.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.565" offset="13673618">The fourth man is not in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.668" offset="13686053">The fourth man has access into this particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.438" offset="13701099">So it seemed to me, that if they wanted to get this particular and protect the particular goods that were in that apartment and search it more in detail at a later time, proper and reasonable police procedure would be to have the officers stay at the apartment to survey it and if that fourth suspect comes back then they can make the arrest at that time, it would seem that that would be an asset to not search the apartment rather than have to search it right away and be fearful that this particular Bacca would come back and take the goods from that particular apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.257" offset="13868387">Now, in so far as this diary and this is what the petitioner is contending at this time is completely unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.770" offset="13902451">The other items that were searched, the petitioner contends, it is possible under Rabinowitz and Harris that these items may have been able to been searched and properly seized by the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.702" offset="13954173">But in so far as that particular diary is concerned, I think it's the burden upon the prosecution when they are attempting to make exceptions to the Fourth Amendment that the particular officer show enough authority and enough diligence and prudence to justify that particular search and to show it into evidence and not have the petitioner show that he has the right supported by the Fourth Amendment but rather have the prosecution show the exceptions to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.622" offset="14141837">Certainly, this case regarding the diary to me seems so clear cut in reviewing the case decisions in Rabinowitz and Harris and all the other decisions, Weeks and Leftkowitz, Go-Bart Company and reviewing in the light of Chimel, all these cases make it so crystal clear to myself and that the particular seizure, search and seizure of the diary was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.280" offset="14256462">The most you can get I think is the search was valid, the seizure is difficult to comprehend as far as, in light of the Court's decisions in the past.</text>
