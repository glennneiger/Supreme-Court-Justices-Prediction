            <text syncTime="19.724" offset="182314">This case brings up for review an order of the District Court of Appeals in the State of Florida which affirms a permanent injunction against picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.496" offset="221393">The picketing was of the kind that is generally known as area standards picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.233" offset="240306">By which we mean that a union which does not necessarily represent the employees in a particular establishment than in this case the union did not, but which does represent employees engaged in the same work in other establishments in the area pickets to publicize the failure of the employer to meet the wage standards or other employment conditions under which his own employees are being employed.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.884" offset="346885">Does that claim depend upon whether this record does or does not show the participation in Longshoremen work by American nationals not part of the ship's crew?</text>

            <text syncTime="77.016" offset="411460">We take the position Your Honor that record is quite clear and that there is no evidence to the contrary that there was participation by American nationals not part of the ship's crew, but we take the alternative condition -- alternative position that have the facts been otherwise and had the record been quite different from what it is and had the record disclosed which it did not, that all of the longshore work but admittedly longshore work was performed by members of the ship's crew than the National Labor Relations Board would still have exclusive jurisdiction and this Court's cases as I shall develop later dealing solely with shipboard relations, labor relations between the crew acting qua crew and the vessel have no applicability to longshore work and do not withdraw jurisdiction from the National Labor Relations Board over longshore labor disputes resulting out of operations wholly within the territorial confines of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.612" offset="693791">That's correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.436" offset="697135">As I shall develop, it is no different from any foreign employer employing aliens wholly within the geographical jurisdiction of the United States to sift the Fiat automobile manufacturing company of Italy where to establish an automobile plant then Detroit and try to staff it wholly with Italian nationals as suppose is conceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.233" offset="788355">We have no question and that is what we urge upon this Court that in that situation, that operation would be subject to the federal labor laws as well as other federal regulatory laws, and we are in effect no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.511" offset="837465">This is work not traditionally seamen's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.111" offset="851780">This is work performed as much on shore as on ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.187" offset="864110">It is work wholly within the geographical confines and the considerations which impel this Court to hold in the three cases relied upon by the Florida courts that shipboard labor relations are not within the jurisdiction of the labor board are totally absent here.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.766" offset="990438">Now, as I understand as they claim these ships carry no freight, no cargo, no automobiles anymore, and that what's involved here is simply carrying passenger suitcases onboard, didn't --</text>

            <label>Mr. Seymour M. Waldman</label>
            <text syncTime="242.531" offset="1073507">Well, Your Honor again, I have got to distinguish between what the record shows and what they contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.467" offset="1101197">And again, I have to make an alternative contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.135" offset="1111960">I have to say that on the basis of this record that point does not arise, but were the record to be otherwise, we would still take sharp issue with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.556" offset="1153546">First, the record does show and it is the only testimony in the record that there was loading of cargo, automobiles, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.184" offset="1184057">They claim the contrary; there is no evidence to that effect in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.284" offset="1204537">Second of all however, they admit that there was the loading and unloading of baggage and there was the loading aboard of ship stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.534" offset="1233481">There is actually other work such as handling of lines that is traditionally longshore work and we pointed out particularly in our reply brief that this is work that the National Labor Relations Board has already traditionally and as a matter of it's rulings held to be longshore work, and it has done that on the basis of the industrial practice that prevails in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.235" offset="1332328">We have cited for example the NLRB certification of the longshore unit in the port of New York, which is of course by far the largest port in the nation, and that certification in express terms applies to the loading of cargo including baggage and ship stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.784" offset="1414457">We have cited the case on the West Coast in which the board assumed jurisdiction over a jurisdictional dispute under Section 10 (k) involving expressly the handling of passenger baggage aboard a foreign cruise ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.128" offset="1475897">And again on the basis of industrial practice where this is longshore work and is historically longshore work awarded this work to the employees represented by the Longshoremen's Union on the West Coast.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.383" offset="1544861">Line handling is traditionally longshore work?</text>

            <text syncTime="369.084" offset="1579760">Certainly as a ship is coming in unless they are going to jump ashore before the lines are cast ashore that has to be shore-based employees working is, and what's performed here and was I think here, this is where factually their wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.380" offset="1640887">It was performed by shore-based terminal labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.007" offset="1659382">Actually, there is another record in another case which so indicates on these vessels and that is why we say, Yes, granted the facts as they say, they're still wrong but the facts are not as they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.284" offset="1716537">And we would say Your Honor that if there is any real issue as to whether or not this work which was admittedly performed as longshore work, that is for the labor board to determine just as the labor board must determine threshold jurisdictional questions such as the status of employees, as supervisors or “employees” within the meaning of act whether an organization is a labor organization within the meaning of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.238" offset="1828342">Otherwise, you have opened up the possibility of a state court, perhaps a hostile state court fashioning its findings in such a way as to exclude from the National Labor Relations Board that jurisdiction which Congress intended it to have.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="446.676" offset="1890095">Well, a mere claim however doesn't take jurisdiction away from the Courts, does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="450.510" offset="1905455">I mean that would violate everything that the Incres case and its companion's stand point which is the labor board doesn't have any jurisdiction whatsoever over the seagoing crew of foreign-flag ships.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.987" offset="1971284">And the mere claim that they are doing some sort of work that somewhere in the United States is done by somebody else except for the cruise ships doesn't take all jurisdiction away from the Courts I should say.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.465" offset="2017259">Well, of course, then you get to the question of who decides it if the claim is well found.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.940" offset="2043173">Somebody has got to make a claim first in some form before they can be proof for deuced.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.569" offset="2065638">Let's assume the claim is made that this crew is going inland several miles and picking up ship supplies out of a warehouse and doing work there and that has created a jurisdictional dispute, a labor dispute because this is traditionally teams to work under the teams just contract for that very establishment, and there's a dispute that arises then, a claim is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.326" offset="2148707">I would have to say Your Honor that I would think that would be for the labor board to determine in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.874" offset="2170859">I suppose you can get frivolous claims, but I don't read the Court's decisions and Incres and Sociedad Nacional to say that when there is a dispute about the nature of the work whether it seamen's work or otherwise, that is a dispute to be determined judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.851" offset="2234807">I don't think those cases pose that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.320" offset="3704665">Now on the preemption point, it is our contention essentially that the considerations which led to this Court's decision in the seamen's cases have no bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.834" offset="3778748">In those cases, this Court was persuaded by not the possibility of a conflict with foreign law, foreign regulations, international treaties to which this nation was a party, but the inevitability of such conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.420" offset="3845099">The relations between seamen and the ship necessarily continue wherever the ship goes throughout the high seas and that any port of call including ports in the United States and ports in the nation of registry.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.694" offset="3902151">They're kind in the nature of the case to be only a single set of laws governing this unitary relationship, a single union representing the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.673" offset="3942066">You can't have separate unions depending on which port of the ship is in it any one moment, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.796" offset="3962546">And for these reasons, there has developed the law of the flag and the principle generally that as a pragmatic expedient that there being one law that must predominate the law of the flag will be that law, and it was this principle in effect that court invoked in the seamen's cases in saying that although the language of the National Labor Relations Act maybe sufficiently broad to cover this type of dispute absent any clearer expression of congressional intent, the Court would not assume that Congress intended to very so the general relations among the nations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.651" offset="5373994">Now this relates primarily to something that Mr. Justice White mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.114" offset="5391862">In terms of the state of the record, I do want to emphasize what we pointed out in our briefs that the District Court of Appeals in Florida seemed to view this case somewhat as the Government's Brief Footnote 6 does, it although affirming described the picketing as protesting the employment of American residents; perhaps I can say that is more favorable to us than need be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.936" offset="5495097">I merely emphasize that certainly the District Court of Appeal did not rest its decision on the ground that this was the foreign crew performing the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.504" offset="5533341">They seem to exclude the foreign crew as longshore labor or entirely in the District Court of Appeals opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.977" offset="5567300">They rested exclusively on the fact that this was a foreign-flag vessel, so that we do not have a case where the state courts contrary to the record adopted the position urged by respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.765" offset="6014412">Now, I just want to emphasize what I said earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.010" offset="6035414">If one were to immunize the work performed by the ship's crew from labor board jurisdiction when that work is not seamen's work, when that work is performed within American territorial confines exclusively, when that work is performed on shore, then I think a Pandora's Box has been opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.662" offset="6141994">The ship's crew of foreign-flag vessels that traditionally paid well below American standards, their conditions generally are well below American standards, and there would be no problem at all in the ship went in port, assigning its crew to do terminal work, to do not only the loading and the unloading of the ship but to do the loading and unloading of the trucks, bringing in cargo or taking cargo away, to do ship repair work and dry dock, and as I say even to go inland and pick up supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.698" offset="6278144">And to me at least, it would be unthinkable but given a statute which is expressly designed to eliminate or minimize disruptive industrial disputes and to secure uniformity that the national board would be powerless to step in to the kind of labor disputes that would inevitably ensue in that kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.497" offset="6381380">We just think that it's perfectly clear that the board has and must have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.687" offset="6398098">And if I may just very briefly touch on the free speech point, this Court has held that in applying the constitutional protections of free speech to picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.958" offset="6455254">Picketing is free speech plus and therefore one must balance the union's rights to express and publicize its disputes and the states rights to control the plus element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.067" offset="6495692">But in doing that, this Court has set forth certain conditions to circumscribe the state because there are constitutional considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.284" offset="6528502">First, the state must define the unlawful objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.678" offset="6542085">Second, the evidence must be federally reviewable and must support the conclusion that there has been this unlawful objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.383" offset="6572910">And third, the unlawful objective must pass federal constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.185" offset="6596106">For example, the states may not demand contract privity as a necessary condition of picketing; that is an archaic economically unrealistic limitation of the boundaries of labor dispute and this Court as so held for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.743" offset="6654307">Here, there is no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.295" offset="6664547">There is no state articulation of the unlawful objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.676" offset="6678026">There is no state finding or conclusion or expression in any opinion as to what objective they do think the union had, and there is no indication what particular rule of law the union is supposed to have violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.424" offset="6733093">There is no opportunity for this Court or any court to pass upon the states standards because they never express.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.141" offset="6759946">And we think that this record fails so abysmally to meet the standards of the Court has set in the picketing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.386" offset="6788890">It almost reaches a due process point of the kind expressed in Thompson against Louisville and Gregory against Chicago and similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.482" offset="6821282">Unless there are further question, if I had time, I would like to reserve that for rebuttal.</text>
