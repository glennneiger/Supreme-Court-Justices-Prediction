            <text syncTime="63.720" offset="358275">-- and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.034" offset="375515">This case is here on certiorari to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.212" offset="396204">Petitioners are minority shareholders of the Electric Auto-Lite Company and they sued derivatively and as a class action on behalf of all other minority shareholders with respect to a merger proxy statement which was mailed to the shareholders of Electric Auto-Lite in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.837" offset="502680">The action is brought against Electric Auto-Lite for whose benefit is sought against Mergenthaler, the majority shareholder which own 54% of Auto-Lite stock and against American Manufacturing Company, the parent of Mergenthaler and owner of 1/3 of its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.606" offset="585749">The story begins about two years earlier when American Manufacturing Company at the top of the pyramid found itself in a legal situation where presumptively, all of the transactions between its affiliates Mergenthaler and Auto-Lite and itself or any of them had to be subject possibly to investment company act scrutiny and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.620" offset="705808">This regulation is substantive termed post some very serious problems and to avoid the risks of this kind of regulation, an application was made to the Corporate Regulation Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission for an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.895" offset="774980">Under a provision which permits such an exception of it can be shown at the business of the parent is not that of an investing company but it is primarily engaged in a business other than that of owning stocks through controlled subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.312" offset="840600">To show that American was primarily engaged in the operation of Auto-Lite and its business on a day-today basis, respondents offered evidence of the fact that Mergenthaler actually dominated the day-to-day business of Auto-Lite and that this was done in cooperation with American and that this domination occurred through the fact that all of the directors -- all of the directors of Auto-Lite had been handpicked.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.501" offset="973406">Seven of them were handpicked by Mergenthaler and seven of them were direct nominees and four of them had been retained at sufferance and as the testimony went there for the benefit of Mergenthaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.023" offset="1031502">Not for the benefit of Auto-Lite as they bought it and thus showing the append exemption order.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.103" offset="1055744">And hard on the heels of this exemption order, they issued the proxy statement with regard to the proposed merger between Mergenthaler and Auto-Lite.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.658" offset="1090017">The proxy statement was completely silent about this domination of the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.353" offset="1116766">In fact, it was completely silent as to any relationship between the Board of Directors of Auto-Lite and Mergenthaler and American.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.128" offset="1151875">And although conscious with the fact that it was necessary to disclose such relationships, they did disclose that there were four directors of Auto-Lite who were common to Mergenthaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.523" offset="1197432">And when I'm to make the post of representation that no director has any other interest direct or indirect in the proposed merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.657" offset="1237974">In the complaint, the plaintiffs have claimed that this was an outcome of misrepresentation which is certainly a major nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.244" offset="1276322">The proxy statement did say that the Board of Directors has carefully considered and approved the terms of the merger and recommends that the shareholders vote to approve the plan of merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.977" offset="1343300">Respondents despite the fact that the suit was pending proceeded to consummate the merger and this puts our situation here in exactly the same context as the situation in Borak versus J. I. case which this Court decided in 1964 and which we say is determinative of the issues here because there too when the merger was consummated, the people took the risk, decided they go ahead knowing there was a lawsuit pending but nevertheless went ahead with the knowledge of what the claims of the plaintiffs were.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.393" offset="1492929">The -- since the facts were undisputed because we have there sworn statements with other case, the District Court took the view that the shareholders were entitled to be informed of these interrelationships between the Board of Directors making the recommendation and the adversary in the merger negotiations and entered judgment -- a summary judgment under rule 56 (c) of the Federal Rules of several procedure which is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of fact that there have been a violation through nondisclosure of a material fact or facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.978" offset="1667323">The Court reserved however brought up the question of cause or relationship and after hearings were held on the cause of relationship and it was demonstrated to the Court that this merger was consummated through the use of proxies procured through the unlawful proxy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.325" offset="1748720">The Court then made a further finding and entered a supplemental summary judgment holding that the issue of liability had been established and that there was a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.129" offset="1815907">The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court on the fact that there was this material nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.722" offset="1858226">Both Courts has little difficulty in coming with the conclusion that the failure to disclose this conflict of interest, the relationship with the adversary was so material that a violation had occurred so the Court of Appeals in a very carefully considered opinion rule that there had been this violation of the Section 14 and Rule 14 (a) and Rule 14 of the regulations promulgated by the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.797" offset="2002526">The District Court reserved all questions of relief for further hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.847" offset="2030738">This under the summary of judgment proceedings of permissible to have a judgment on liability first and then after that is disposed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.141" offset="2071907">The appeal by the appellants of course came immediately after the District Court's ruling and finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.099" offset="2111718">Since the Court of Appeals found that there had been a violation and that the facts not disclosed were material, the respondents here filed no petition for certiorari and did not seek to save that question for review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.873" offset="2206908">When petitioners filed a petition, the respondents resisted our petition, filed no cross petition, and we believe that that matter is therefore not pending before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.845" offset="2254764">Now, this Court requested the Government to file a brief as amicus and the Government in its brief as will be noted aggress with petitioners' view as to what issues are pending on this certiorari hearing and theirs are essentially the same as our.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.919" offset="2327071">That was the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.800" offset="2330624">The respondents of course attempt to seek a review and a weighing of the evidence by this Court and a great length in their brief, they argue what evidence it was before the other Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.304" offset="2376600">We have not answered that because we have felt governed by the rules of this Court and we've adhered to the question only that on which this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.893" offset="2422993">The -- now in a separate portion of the opinion, the Court of Appeals deals with the question of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.939" offset="2459146">And here it rules that the District Court was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.966" offset="2479208">Although agreeing that the proxy statement caused the merger in the sense that those essential to the merger were procured through the unlawful proxy statement, the Court of Appeals laid down a different test of causation asking whether the misleading statement and omission caused the submission of sufficient proxies to change the result of the vote as the Court of Appeals said more exact question is whether that particular misrepresentation and are wrongful -- material wrongful omission actually resulted in the votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.247" offset="2644407">The cracks of the Court of Appeals' opinion, lies at this point toward the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.715" offset="2666245">It's within the last two pages of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.962" offset="2679202">The material offered by defendants on the merits of the terms of merger suggest that it may be possible for them to satisfy the Court by preponderance of probabilities that the merger would have received a sufficient even if the proxy statement had not been misleading in the respect found.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.843" offset="2770735">The petitioners take the position that this kind of speculation or guesswork attempt to unscramble the minds of the 5400 minority shareholders who voted for the merger is essentially going to be a guesswork proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.362" offset="2864776">The type of undertaking that courts do not undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.416" offset="2877001">There are many decisions fully won by Justice Cardozo long ago in which at common law, he said that we can't get in to these nice speculations as to which particular bit of information in a series -- complicated series of facts affected the person's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.805" offset="2974595">But the Court of Appeals was really talked about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.152" offset="2983999">They speak of a footnote when they say the Court's finding question common law is reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.591" offset="3005733">Now, there's nothing in the Borak case, there's nothing in the Exchange Act of 1934 which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.690" offset="3034154">There's nothing in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission that says anything about reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.922" offset="3059022">The -- we get down to the question of what is the purpose of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.366" offset="3076786">Our text must be Borak because we think Borak inclusively disposes in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.739" offset="3102281">The test is what was the purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="754.208" offset="3120253">And the purpose was to have an honest suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.294" offset="3140524">This -- the Rule 14 in Section 14 (a) do not say that all under fair mergers are barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.263" offset="3180440">This is a disclosure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.962" offset="3187231">It says you must make full disclosure so that there may be a fully informed voting on the question that is presented in the proxy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.858" offset="3226833">If the proponents of a merger want to set out all of the horrible things and assuming a plan is just terribly untrue and they want to set the whole thing out, and they tell everything fully, there's no violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.036" offset="3275525">But the Court of Appeals in interpreting a federal statute has gone the common law standards and creates this impracticable standard as to how you resolve what went on in people's minds and this assumes of course that the stockholders would have voted for any fair merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.891" offset="3354937">They don't discuss whether it may be just fair, a little bit fair, a whole light fair, overwhelming of what.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.655" offset="3378030">The assumption is that the shareholders in guessing what went on their minds and guessing and speculating what they would do would vote for a fair merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.003" offset="3419408">Well, that is not consistent with known facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.926" offset="3435081">People have many reasons for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.265" offset="3444381">Here, there were many facts disclosed as to market value, the book value -- the book value here was $88.00 a share and the people were getting less than 75% of book on this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.992" offset="3503313">And when one analyze that the figures in the proxy statement would realize they weren't even getting the market value of their Auto-Lite shares because the preferred shares of Mergenthaler that would be giving an exchange if converting into common immediately would bring something like $6.00 to $9.00 less on the market than they would've had for their shares of Auto-Lite.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.634" offset="3585860">But the reason that the whole plan was unfair was that the -- they were taking less at less than 75% of book of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.687" offset="3622118">Now, with all of these, it is true --</text>

            <text syncTime="919.728" offset="3782301">It was a showing that there was a violation of the proxy rules and plaintiffs maintain that to establish our cause of action under Borak, fairness has absolutely nothing to do with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.799" offset="3826604">The Court of Appeals injected this issue of fairness and they setup a standard that is the plan is fair, we will assume that the people would've voted for it and if you, the plaintiffs -- the petitioners or plaintiffs are unable to establish that the plan was unfair or putting the bird in the other way, they said that the respondents by the burden of persuasion should demonstrate that this is fair if they can and they put in their expert witnesses and so on and then we put in ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.303" offset="3952619">And you get down to the question of whether or not at a very lengthy battle of attrition as to whether or not it's fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.144" offset="5031999">In Sterling versus May Flower, it was held that when there is a merger, the only damage that the shareholder can get is the merger of value.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.671" offset="5390085">They went out in the market and bought hundreds of thousands of share and they set up the excess over market as an asset on their books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.068" offset="5419656">And it took $800,000.00 a year of that excess value and treated it as earnings and then in triggering out these fantastic merger ratio, they said, “Look at how much more earnings Mergenthaler has.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.392" offset="5468975">Now, Auto-Lite can't give nay consideration whatsoever to the value -- to any such values that Mergenthaler's value and earnings are appreciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.431" offset="5509099">They had some $30 million or some huge sum and they put that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.927" offset="5531042">They were writing it off on their books as additional income earned by Mergenthaler and it was nothing more than the difference between what they picked up the share for the market and the excess of book value over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.158" offset="5580048">All that we are saying is we are not asking for divestiture other than the fact that we put the prayer in our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.245" offset="5608364">We are asking for restitutionary measures of damages as stated in Borak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.511" offset="5633442">Borak cites that the departures, the independent shares under the 33 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.509" offset="5653400">It says “the language here of jurisdiction is virtually identical with that in the 33 Securities Act and there you can get restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.894" offset="5686941">We want the restitutionary measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.923" offset="5695091">We want it as of the moment before the merger with all the transaction that never occurred, then you'll look at the book value, you look at the liquidating value, you'd look at all these values because if these assets, the position of the minority was sold those majority shareholder for less than it was worth, then we are entitled to get what was really worth it because all it was, was a liquidation of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.675" offset="5786102">And they sold out our share and they sold all the assets to themselves and they're giving us what they want to give us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.947" offset="5811179">We think we're entitled to get what they were really worth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.864" offset="5942836">I unfortunately caught a cold yesterday and I think it has affected my hearing a little bit but not otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.982" offset="5971257">If Your Honors please, it may be unusual and perhaps it's unusual that Securities and Exchange Commission case be as living as a case as this one involving uses of summary judgment procedures so that the respondent in this case has never had a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.308" offset="6076583">The limitation of various issues arguments now in this Court that under a splendid benefit of statute as this one is that what the Congress intended and what the Securities and Exchange Commission intended at adopting a rule under Section 14 (a) was to cut off -- to cut off a consideration of any Court including this one at some early stage of the game if there is say let us say a technical any kind of alleged violation of the rule which I'm about to read to Your Honors that at that moment further judicial inquiry seizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.447" offset="6265187">And as Mr. Shure has argue to Your Honors, there comes a situation in which that Trial Court must then say to itself as of the time of the consummation of this merger that have molded to a purchase by the surviving company of the company merged into that surviving company and so you must judge its value on pure asset value as a way of a liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.801" offset="6378559">Fairness is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.180" offset="6392142">Did Congress intend by the adoption of this benefition statute and the SEC adopting the rule under it that fairness should be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.215" offset="6440208">Now, may I turn to Borak Mr. Justice White has imparted Mr. Shure on that subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.582" offset="6481690">On this issue, Mr. Justice White and Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen, what this Court said, first, that case as Your Honors will clearly recall of course was a holding that Section 14 (a) created a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.757" offset="6562356">It did not have the mercy of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.937" offset="6571133">It did not have to sue under a common law or fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.663" offset="6582000">You had a federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.513" offset="6597465">And when there was oppressing in recourse to that case as to the consequences of a violation, great, small and deferred or horrendous as the case might be, what was the consequence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.003" offset="6655352">Mr. Justice Clark before the Court said, “The causal relationship--” and I'm quoting from that case, “The causal relationship for the proxy material and the merger are questions of fact to be resolved at the trial not here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.348" offset="6736750">Now, may I respectfully suggest that to me means that if a violation is determined upon by the trial court after considering all the circumstances, then the Court goes on to determine what the consequences are cause of relationships have resulted and that one of those factors as far as the Securities and Exchange Commission says in this amicus curiae brief submitted to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.226" offset="6856286">Now, what is the statute or rule as presented here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.459" offset="6873213">It is simply this, no solicitation subject to this regulation shall be made by means of any proxy statement, form of proxy, notice of meeting or other communication written or oral containing any statement which at that time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.798" offset="6998601">May I repeat that if Your Honors please, at that time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made is false or misleading with respect to any material of fact or which shall omit the State any material fact necessary in order to make the statements they're in not faults or misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.823" offset="7098702">Now, what happened in this particular case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.973" offset="7147290">A proxy statement of 108 pages set forth in Volume 1 of the transcript annex of this case was sent to the shareholder three weeks before a proposed merger meeting of the shareholders, received by Mr. Shure's clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.568" offset="7225657">And here they turned -- one client turned over the proxy statement to him, the other client I know was that Mr. Mill's assessment to Mr. Norman Nasher of the Chicago bar, most distinguished lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.034" offset="7279470">They expressed their views that is, the clients that they understood the proxy statement, they were opposed to the merger and they voted against the merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.064" offset="12199581">Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors, the fairness as a matter of a fair ratio of exchange in the merger is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.326" offset="12248691">What we seek is the value of what we gave up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.171" offset="12268022">We charge unfairness in the sense that the respondents were unjustly enriched not that the ratio exchange was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.580" offset="12309713">It is not Mr. Shure who wrote the Act and said that the trial section shall be deemed as void, Congress said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.423" offset="12341060">We are taking the posture the Congress places and in says “the wrong doer shall not profit”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.386" offset="12368959">Now, Mr. John B. Dawson who's the outstanding authority of Harvard, and the subject of unjust enrichment wrote as leading text on that in 1951 and any resort to that shows that remedies at law that the general attempted remedy -- remedy as an equity tracing of assets, equitable liens and so on are all different forms and this is what people who understand the law of restitution are talking about when they say that you shall view a transaction under the Securities Act as void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.774" offset="12510438">It means that you get that not with all the consequences of the merger attached to it but with the situation as it existed before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.048" offset="12555577">We are contempt to let the Government's brief speak for itself as to what they're referring is relevant to the -- to causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.698" offset="12582118">The Court asked -- Mr. Justice Harlan Mr. Jenner as to what the differences were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.827" offset="12602702">There's a very substantial difference, they don't agree at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.624" offset="12613883">The Government says that the judgment should stand the judgment of the Trial Court that we have proved everything necessary to establish a cause of action and that certain consequences flow from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.443" offset="12661112">They do say as we agree that fairness of the ratio of exchange -- and I'm talking about the Commission may be relevant to one measure of monetary recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.078" offset="12691728">But the fairness that the exchange ratio is not the only measure of damages and the fairness of the ratio is not relevant to unjust enrichment causes of action which is the basis of the remedies under the 34 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.629" offset="12749928">Borak points that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.511" offset="12761422">This Commission said but where ends here misleading aspect of situation -- solicitation did not relate to the terms of merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.465" offset="12793187">The mislead stockholders should be entitled a monetary or other relief only if the merger resulted in a reduction to them of earnings or earnings potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.062" offset="12823594">Now what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.563" offset="12829654">That means that if we were entitled to get 2.5 shares of preferred stock under the merger and we only received 1 8/10, then we ought to get it or get that in dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.853" offset="12874794">We are the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.266" offset="12880436">We are the ones who have been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.622" offset="12885870">We brought the suit whose here and we are asking that all these people who were short changed on the merger in anyway you look at that proxy statement, it is inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.704" offset="12926203">What did they do here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.562" offset="12929651">They took $23.00 a share of the book value off the bars and they gave -- we ended up with $64.00 or $65.00 a share, $64.86 and the shareholders at Mergenthaler end up with $107.00 a share of book value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.574" offset="12985657">They just handed it over to the other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.633" offset="12993912">And we are told here that we just have no remedy here if the ratio of exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.257" offset="13016377">We would get into a war here of experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.780" offset="13026513">And that's what the small shareholder is not able to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.679" offset="13046053">We can't match the great corporation with all of its assets in that kind of a war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.938" offset="13063084">Congress envisioned this sort of thing and gave us a short, quick remedy of restitution and said we can have any avenue relief --</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.875" offset="13106866">The only byway of emphasis as far as the Government is concerned, I believe that at page 18 of their brief, they did not explain what they meant by earnings potential -- laws of earnings or earnings potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.094" offset="13171754">Obviously looking at the Government's brief and looking at their other writings that is inescapable if this is unjust enrichment we're talking about, then we can get at that unjust enrichment at any way that the facts can be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.519" offset="13229432">And we say that there is no room for any further hearing on cause of relation hold that there is this room for remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.182" offset="13256077">They can -- if somebody wants to have a trial on the question of fairness of what we received, this is an entirely different situation from proving the fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.857" offset="13306755">And the Government says to us “you're not entitled at getting damages if you didn't lose anything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.584" offset="13325667">But what have the Court of Appeals said?</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.950" offset="13331205">The Court of Appeals said “if you don't get divestiture because it was a fair plan, then you don't get anything,” except of course as they gave us a bill for $9000.00 of cost for losing the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.835" offset="13382719">They reversed and assessed the cost against us when we vindicated the law and we won on the issue of materiality and the fact of violation but they say we lose the case and we get absolutely nothing by restitution or any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.384" offset="13440920">The Court of Appeals seems to envision this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.438" offset="13449174">It's either restitution or it's either divestiture unscrambling of merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.031" offset="13467460">And if you read their opinion, the language is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.147" offset="13479999">They give this as a rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.537" offset="13485537">Not every merger should be set aside because of a nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.064" offset="13499643">And as far as I am not going to rebut to what Mr. Jenner said about whether there was fraud charge or not, that matter is not before this Court and we didn't do it in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.178" offset="13536110">I don't think we should spend our time on it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.360" offset="13548857">The respondents will get a full trial of the question of what the damages should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.336" offset="13568711">We don't want this Court to foreclose us from using any of the means of securing restitution that Borak says that it should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.543" offset="13609566">And Borak relied on Decker versus Independent Shares which also talked of restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.246" offset="13632345">And Borak talked of the Section 33 Act which gives a restitutionary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.518" offset="13657422">Now this is what we're talking about that the wrong doer gets no benefit whatsoever out of his wrong doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.108" offset="13679783">But when I say that, I don't mean you tear the thing asunder, I'm not interested in tearing apart corporate structures, I cite that as one of the things we ask for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.628" offset="13713847">You go down the languages and state your prayers in a complaint, you ask for all the different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.295" offset="13736521">Every lawyer does this in drafting a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.943" offset="13747179">But as per accounting, ask for damages, we are not trying to be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.942" offset="13767137">We feel we've been very badly dealt with in this on the basis of the -- what we are going to get under the merger because it is -- it was so far below book value and they gave our book value the other side.</text>
