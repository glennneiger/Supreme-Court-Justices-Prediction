            <text syncTime="27.776" offset="214497">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.998" offset="227349">This case is here on appeal from a final judgment of a statutory three-judge court convened in the Southern District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.673" offset="266115">It was drawn in 1967 by Negro appellants as a class action challenged violations of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments by Georgia statutes and state constitutional provisions which set out an interlocking system of jury and school board selection and also to enjoin racial discrimination in the enforcement of these statutes by appellee officials in Taliaferro County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.237" offset="396309">Appellants make three claims in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.110" offset="411773">That the Georgia statute which authorizes jury commissioners to exclude persons from service they deem not intelligent and upright is void for one of the standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.042" offset="463496">Secondly that the District Court failed to grant adequate relief to reform racial selection of jurors and school board members, and third that a restriction that school board members be freeholders or real property owners violates the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.114" offset="551790">The Georgia system for jury and school board selection which is at the center of this case begins when a superior court judge is elected by the voters of multi-county circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.330" offset="612707">In this case, Taliaferro County is one of six counties which vote to elect the superior court judge for the Tombs Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.358" offset="656802">The judge then selects six citizens of each county who serve as jury commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.613" offset="685850">These commissioners in turn select jurors from the official registered voter list by disqualifying persons from the list, who they do not believe are intelligent and upright and also by disqualifying persons who are not the right age and haven’t resided in the county for the right period of time and for other similar reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.801" offset="786578">They then reduced the number remaining randomly in order to get a workable number and place that number on a traverse jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.449" offset="825135">From the traverse list, they select not more than two-fifths to constitute the grand jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.697" offset="850108">And from this list, the superior court judge selects names which ultimately constitute the county grand jury.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="281.392" offset="1228988">Whenever there has to be a vacancy, now if there is a death or resignation, the school board will pick and interim candidate but the next grand jury will then act and is free to select whoever it wants for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.689" offset="1290115">If there is a vacancy due to be end of the term, the grand jury preceding that vacancy will make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.227" offset="1324283">Now prior to the institution of this litigation in 1967, no Negro had ever been selected to serve as a jury commissioner by the circuit -- by the superior court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.164" offset="1376005">And while black people are 60% of the population in this county and 50% of the voters, only a small number of their number were on the jury lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.912" offset="1423026">No county grand jury had ever selected a black school board member, although since 1965 the schools were totally black.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.500" offset="1465344">Whites having fled rather than attend desegregated schools to a horribly setup private school in the county or to adjoining counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.654" offset="1509961">Indeed, until the District Court acted in an earlier case involving several of the parties in 1965 by setting up a receivership over the public schools of the county, public funds were used to transport the whites out of county to other schools.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="377.423" offset="1613093">The record only shows the race of the judge now in office as white.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.879" offset="1638902">I think it was assumed by all the parties and the District Court that there never had been one at least in the preceding 80 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.704" offset="1686235">After taking evidence, the District Court informed the jury commissioners and school board members that there was racial discrimination in the selection of the jury and that the exclusion of blacks from the school board could not continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.672" offset="1758020">The court ordered the defendants to make an attempt to remedy the situation and suggested that two blacks to be put on the school board prior to a reconvening of the court a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.892" offset="1818937">The jury commissioners during this period recompiled the jury list placing additional Negroes on it and a new grand jury was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.938" offset="1863137">However, the commissioners excluded a 171 Negroes and only seven whites because they failed to meet the statutory requirement that jurors be intelligent and upright.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.187" offset="1924159">The new grand jury made two appointments to the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.490" offset="1937324">One was a white man and one was a black man.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.118" offset="1951848">The black man chosen had a third grade education, no children in the school and he was selected without the public notice which is required by Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.868" offset="2002840">On the basis of the recomposition of the jury list, the addition of one Negro to the school board and its view as to the constitutional questions presented, the District Court merely enjoined future racial exclusion in selection of the grand jury and denied further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.331" offset="2096671">Appellants first contention in this Court is that Section 59-106 of the Georgia Code violates the Fourteenth Amendment by authorizing jury commissioners to exclude men who they believe are not upright and intelligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.967" offset="2171277">Now certainly these terms with the synonyms used by Georgia officials to characterize there meaning, the word like understanding or honesty are words which have no commonly accepted meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.452" offset="2233135">They are matters of personal judgment unless they are tied to some objective standard as they are not in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.986" offset="2267303">There are several consequences to their use which supports the appellant’s contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.452" offset="2293217">They violate the Fourteenth Amendment when placed in the hands of the man who select eligible jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.233" offset="2328325">The first is that they make the right to participate in the institution of Government depend on the will, whim, or caprice of a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.387" offset="2376913">The court has condemned placing such discretion in the hands of voting registrars as jury commissioners exercise a similar function.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.579" offset="2417664">There is no reason why a different rule should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.071" offset="2439607">Secondly, because men cannot agree as to the meaning of these terms to their application to particular individuals, they always command arbitrary, erratic and inconsistent judgments between individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.108" offset="2511809">Thus at the outset, the use of these terms seems to me are basically inconsistent with the notion of due process of law that more rather than men will govern whether or not one can exercise a right.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.262" offset="3064456">Now here, there is absolutely no necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.464" offset="3073233">Congress has passed a perfectly satisfactory jury selection statute which does away with the capacity for arbitrariness and discrimination which this form of statute has.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.550" offset="3121612">Secondly, a jury deciding a negligence case for example is not selecting among individuals in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.053" offset="3155571">It is perhaps exercising an ad hoc judgment which in certain circumstances the law allows.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.885" offset="3186918">The question is whether the results that this record show and the capacity which this Court has already condemned in many, many other areas are necessary and I submit that they’re not here and that there is no state interest involved in allowing the jury commissioners this much discretion to select among individuals at their will.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.490" offset="3585337">But our quarrel would still exist with the statute because the statute -- the problem with the statute is that it makes almost impossible selection between individuals which is not erratic and which does not depend on the will of the selecting official.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.561" offset="3657644">Now I think another thing that one might consider here is that it’s totally impossible to review and appraise and evaluate the decision made by these jury commissioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.931" offset="5715048">And that’s not only as jury selection involved here, but the grand jury has been given a political function and so the operation of the statute is to exclude blacks from selecting public officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.573" offset="5809716">And so as important as in participating in the administration of justices, we have even more important rights at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.224" offset="5852244">My second claim that -- the second claim that we wish to present to the Court is that the District Court did not adequately reform the system of jury and school board selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.426" offset="5901040">Certainly, if the Court strikes down the broad discretion which Georgia law grants the jury commissioners that will no doubt make far more likely non-racial jury and school board selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.892" offset="5954957">But there is still need for equitable relief to eliminate the effects of past discrimination and to make it unlikely to recur in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.428" offset="5997066">Initially, the present school boards still has on it, person selected by grand juries which for themselves unconstitutionally selective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.390" offset="6044923">And one step, we think that the District Court should be required to take on remand is to vacate the membership board in order to -- and the effects of past discrimination and make a great with the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.170" offset="6112005">More fundamentally to make sure that discrimination does not recur, at a minimum, the District Court should appoint black jury commissioners as was sort in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.261" offset="6164459">The commissioners play critical role in this process in a small amount of discrimination in the future with tip control with the grand jury to whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.851" offset="6214823">They have discriminated in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.514" offset="6233422">They have -- there has never been a black jury commissioner and the whole process works over an issue which blacks in this county have enormous interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.657" offset="6285981">Whites on the other hand have no interest comparable in educational quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.643" offset="6309909">I think it’s a little like the Voter Registration Act if I can use that -- the Voting Rights Act of 1965 if I can use that analogy where the statute provided that under certain circumstances, the courts might appoint voting registrars to administer even a non-discretionary system of voting registration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.921" offset="6611048">Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.695" offset="6630170">There’s no question but the Georgia’s juror selection statute is capable of being improperly administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.828" offset="6666637">There is no question but that in Taliaferro County, Georgia, it has been improperly administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.801" offset="6694536">What is in question is whether Georgia of for that matter any other state may prescribe juror qualifications which call for an exercise of judgment on the part of the public board or public officials responsible for composing the jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.260" offset="6772381">This is the true question before the Court for two simple reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.720" offset="6790248">First of all is self-evident that whenever law requires judgment to be exercised, there is the possibility, they will be exercised improperly or wrongfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.301" offset="6840613">Second, because of the capacity and people being as they are, we can anticipate that from time to time statutes providing for the exercise of judgment will be administered improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.402" offset="6901008">Now of course the question of juror qualifications goes to the very heart of the concept of trial by jury, the concept which this Court just a little more than one year ago in Duncan versus Louisiana declared to be “Fundamental to the American scheme of justice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.189" offset="6980106">State legislatures including Georgia’s general assembly have quite generally supposed that the right to trial by jury means trial by jurors who are first of all possessed of intelligence sufficient to understand the matters they may be called upon to judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.272" offset="7056488">And secondly that they shall have such moral character as will enhance the possibility of a fair verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.812" offset="7090657">Some example of the character and intelligence qualifications of the various states are included at pages 12 and 13 of appellant’s jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.296" offset="7136528">We think both the statutes are essentially indistinguishable from Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.620" offset="7161814">Maine for example provides qualifications as follows, “of good moral character, of approved integrity, of sound judgment, and well informed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.332" offset="7204655">In New York, it’s of good character, of approved integrity and sound judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.447" offset="7229210">In Michigan, it’s of good character, of approved integrity, of sound judgment, and well informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.557" offset="7257631">Nebraska also uses intelligent, of fair character, of approved integrity, and well informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.003" offset="7287411">Now this Court in the past has always adhered to the view that such character and intelligence qualifications are at the very least consistent with if not required by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.916" offset="7343000">Over a hundred years ago, in Strauder versus West Virginia, this Court planned out that the Fourteenth Amendment was never intended to prevent a state from prescribing such qualifications of age and educational qualifications as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.246" offset="7412381">More recently in Brown versus Allen, this Court after observing that State should decide for themselves the matter of the quality of their juries stated that the Court ought not to impose on States, its conception of the proper source of jury list so long as a source reasonably reflects a cross-section of the population suitable in character and intelligence for this civic duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.266" offset="7520423">In rejecting, the same sort of attack which appellants make here, the Supreme Court of Georgia only this year relied upon Brown versus Allen in the case of Sullivan versus State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.828" offset="7566712">When it said that in using the words suitable and intelligence, that is the words of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.871" offset="7590849">The Supreme Court must necessarily have had reference to good character, honorable or just persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.742" offset="7618330">The Supreme Court of Georgia continued that in using the words suitable and intelligence for that civic duty, this Court must have meant persons sufficiently intelligent to serve as jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.560" offset="7673605">Now, we recognize of course that the law also requires the jury to reflect the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.330" offset="7708714">I read from Georgia statute which is currently in effect and was in effect at the time of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.937" offset="7735150">In composing such jury list, the commissioners select a fairly representative cross-section of the intelligent and upright citizens of the county from the official registered voters list and that the statute goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.633" offset="7793873">If at any time it appears to the jury commissioners that the jury list so composed is not fairly representative cross-section of the intelligent and upright citizens of the county, they shall supplement such list by going out into the county and personally acquainting themselves with other citizens of the county including intelligent and upright citizens of any significantly identifiable group in the county which may not be fairly represented thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.846" offset="7914768">We think it’s quite clear from the statute that its entire thrust is to avoid discrimination based on race or economic status.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.081" offset="12979702">We have concluded that the most appropriate remedy is for the District Court to try and make this system of selection which is ingrained in state law work and we think the way --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3230.917" offset="13027035">Counsel, would you raise your voice a little?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="3232.379" offset="13032887">I’m sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.367" offset="13040828">We have concluded that if this statute is knocked down by the court, our challenge is successful that the most appropriate way for the District Court to assure that the system of school board selection and jury selection works is to appoint black jury commissioners to put them in this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.259" offset="13132361">Because a very small amounted discrimination on the part of the commissioners would tip the balance in the grand jury which selects the school --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3267.551" offset="13173530">Well tell me Mr. Meltsner, I know that such a complaint asked that on the premise statutes struck down that you wanted membership on the board of education and jury commission to be declared vacant, a receiver be appointed to operate the public schools and in selection of constitutionally acceptable board that a special master select members of the grand and petit juries and that ancillary damages be worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.098" offset="13275721">Do you still press for all that relief?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="3294.803" offset="13282617">Well not, we do not press in this Court for ancillary damages but all that relief may be appropriate to the District Court to advice a system which will assure their selection.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3305.778" offset="13326503">You don’t think a mere declaratory judgment would be enough?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_meltsner" startTime="3308.930" stopTime="3374.036">
            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="3308.930" offset="13339042">Absolutely not, after there was a declaratory judgment, 96% of the persons excluded under the statutory test were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.945" offset="13371120">Declaratory judgment is not going to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.317" offset="13380629">Now with respect to Mr. Justice Douglas’ question as to the freeholder requirement, this is just something I wish to bring to the Court’s attention in this point because I just discovered it really and that is that Georgia has two other ways of selecting school boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.883" offset="13450951">One is a -- local law may be passed and the referendum take place and other is that area school boards may be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.137" offset="13487940">Now the constitutional provisions which provide for these systems of selection say nothing about freeholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.805" offset="13514585">Indeed, they delegate to the voters of the particular communities, the power to set qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.559" offset="13545618">Thus, there can’t be very much of a state interest involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.201" offset="13560142">Finally, I just -- one more point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.168" offset="13572054">Mr. Justice Stewart, these statutes with the exception of the cross-section to the community language are all reconstruction statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.036" offset="13599535">They are talking about that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.391" offset="13604968">I see.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.393" offset="13608939">Finally, I just wish to make it perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.012" offset="13623463">We do not disagree that a state has an interest in the intelligent and upright jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.196" offset="13652198">We merely assert that the test involved in the statute is not the way to achieve that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.530" offset="13677484">It grants too much discretion and invites racial discrimination.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="3406.804" offset="13730565">I think some of them definitely will but I think in most of them, my own experience is that in most of them, there are administrative procedures grafted onto them which make the selection much fairer but certainly many of these statutes will have to go.</text>
