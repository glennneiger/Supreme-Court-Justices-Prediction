            <text syncTime="26.013" offset="103967">This case is on writ of certiorari to the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.237" offset="120895">It involves the refusal to admit Sara Baird to the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.894" offset="139494">Sara Baird, the petitioner in this case has graduated from Stanford Law School.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.707" offset="158824">She has passed the bar examination and there’s no evidence whatsoever that she fails or lacks to have good moral character and the exclusion of her or the refusal to process her application stands entirely from the questionnaire and affidavit submitted to the applicants to practice law in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.963" offset="247850">There are two questions on that questionnaire and affidavit which are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.204" offset="272718">Question 25 requests the bar applicant to list all organizations, associations and clubs of which you are or had been a member since attaining the age of 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.965" offset="323814">Petitioner complied with this request and did list the organizations as best she could recall and at the last argument of this case, the record was supplemented to show that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.939" offset="371670">Question 27, however, is the one petitioner did not answer and that asks whether “Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party or any organization that advocates to overthrow the United States Government by force or violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.997" offset="451918">On its face, it request the applicant to make some sort of judgment about the organizations which she has listed in response to Question 25 and it is supplemented in the record by the Bar Committee that the expressed purpose for this question is to seek out an orthodox political belief that the Bar Committee has told us and it is in the record that the basic hypothesis for this question is that one who believes in the overthrow of the Government cannot practice law in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.585" offset="594338">The question is framed so that if a “yes” answer is given to Question 27, there will be triggered and investigation and interrogation into the views and beliefs of the applicant and the Committee promises without equivocation that if indeed they found from that interrogation and investigation that the bar applicant believed in the overthrow of the Government, that would be sufficient to exclude her from the practice of law or any other applicant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.195" offset="5816738">I’m referring to the responsibility and the function which a committee performs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.797" offset="5843174">I’m referring to the problem that was before this Committee which caused this Committee to take the position it did and which has led to this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.844" offset="5883298">For counsel, I am sure inadvertently stated that Sara Baird had been rejected for admission to the Bar of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.653" offset="5918511">This is an inaccurate statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.369" offset="5929378">The matter is like Mohammed’s coffin, suspended between heaven and earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.470" offset="5953829">The Committee has made no recommendation to the court and the court has made no ruling in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.230" offset="5984862">The rules first provide with respect to the obligation to the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.150" offset="6012552">No applicant shall -- will be examined until this application has been considered enacted upon by and permission granted by the Committee to take such examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.990" offset="6055915">No permission shall be grant -- will be granted until it is established to the satisfaction of the Committee and there follows a number of things the Supreme Court requires of the Committee that they affirmatively find before they permit the applicant to sit for the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.730" offset="6130834">The rules provide that the applicant must file an affidavit and questionnaire and that Mr. Justice Black is the instrument that is printed as the appendix and it is also contained in this little pamphlet which I have distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.228" offset="6188826">The rule and I’m reading from page 5 of the pamphlet, “after said applicants questionnaire and affidavit fully answered under oath is filed, the Committee will make such investigation as it deems proper for the purposes of determining whether or not the applicant possesses the qualifications specified in Rule 6 such investigation were ordinarily not required within 30 days and includes a right to require a personal interview.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.133" offset="6304496">Now, if it please the Court, a character committee as well as an examinations committee is faced at least it seems to the members of the Committee where it very honors responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.658" offset="6358622">The responsibility of telling to the Supreme Court of whatever state it acts, it sits in that this particular man does in fact or this particular woman does in fact possess not only the learning qualifications, the knowledge of the law but also possesses the character which can be safely entrusted with the many responsibilities and privileges and prerogatives which do attest to the office of -- or the privilege of being an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.081" offset="6488294">Now, I’d like also to emphasize to the Court so that this question of due process and this question of arbitrary treatment is put the rest of ours in the State of Arizona is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.911" offset="6543569">The Court will note, and I’m reading now from page 9 I’m referring now to page 9 of this pamphlet, that our Supreme Court has spelled out with reasonable meticulous detail what must be done before the Committee may reject and what it must do if it does reject an applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.480" offset="6621832">The rules provide for two types of proceedings, the informal proceeding and a formal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.044" offset="6644088">This is before the Committee in considering whether an applicant should be recommended for admission or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.928" offset="6671673">If the record upon which the Committee is going to act is one which has been supplied by the applicant, if it is a record which either represents what he has said and has filed with the Committee and what is on the face of the record what the Committee is going to act on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.237" offset="6744921">The Committee may then supplement that by informal conferences with the applicant but the rule specifically say that if you’re going to supplement that record upon which you are going to deny this man permission to practice, you must do it in writing if he asks for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.334" offset="6817332">If it is an interview, it must be stenographic to report an interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.102" offset="6832379">It must be filed with the applicants file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.344" offset="6845336">The rule says, if you’re going to deny him permission or not deny him, I beg your pardon, if you’re going to recommend against his admission, you then must put a writing and in his file the specific reasons why you’re denying him, you’re recommending against his admission and that must be available for consideration by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.877" offset="6999458">The rules provide that we may not permit an applicant to sit for a bar exam but for many years by a tacit approval of the Supreme Court or a file has not been completely clear, an applicant is permitted conditionally to take the bar exam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.785" offset="7067063">An applicant signs a letter stating he understand or she understands its a conditional thing and that if the file is not clear, the grades will not be completed and the applicant will not be recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.547" offset="7110113">In other words, with a six months log if you have a small tag end in that hasn’t been cleared up, if you have as in this case it would appear maybe an over side even.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.196" offset="7148774">You don’t deny that applicant the right to sit for the bar exam and say you got a wait six months to sit again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.694" offset="7174687">You say you can take it conditionally upon your file being cleared and you being recommended to the Supreme Court for admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.142" offset="7204467">And in this case as is reflected either in the printed record or on the record which has come up from the Arizona Supreme Court, Sara Baird sat conditionally because her file had not been cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.787" offset="7251069">Now, there is no point in quibbling about it, but tentative grading of Sara Baird’s papers showed she did a good job.</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.610" offset="8302341">The Committee again emphasizes that a mere answer of “yes” would not lead to an automatic rejection of the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.164" offset="8332643">It will lead to an investigation and interrogation as to whether or not the applicant presently entertains the view that a violent overthrow the United States Government is something to be sought after.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.119" offset="8500454">Yes, I would say to this Court, we would reject them and recommend to the Court they be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.885" offset="8531487">If the answer to the inquiry was “yes” then indeed, no I’m sorry, it will lead to an investigation and interrogation as to whether or not the applicant presently entertains that view that a violent overthrow of the United States Government is something to be sought after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.478" offset="8593868">If the answer to this inquiry was “yes” then indeed, in other words, that they are in favor of violent to overthrow the Government now, we would reject the applicant or recommend against her admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.295" offset="8645172">We go on to say and this is the Committee’s official position in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.425" offset="8661682">I believe that Mrs. Baird should realize that even though she answered the question, that she had one time been a communist or had otherwise been an associate with organizations not regard as friend of the United States Government, then we would not, that’s -- that would not necessarily call as to reject her application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.668" offset="8734616">We would undoubtedly going to ask her some questions as to her present beliefs and as to other matter to which would bear upon the effect on such membership would have upon her qualifications to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.187" offset="8788741">The Committee would again emphasize to this Court that if the answer to Question 27 is “yes” the committee will then endeavor to ascertain if Sara Baird does adhere to the view that the overthrow of the United States Government of this State and of the United States by force and violence would be a desirable objective, and that she would expect to actively support such views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.040" offset="8880065">Now, it seems to me if it please the Court, that this is sufficient to put this case in a posture, in a clear context to what is really involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.955" offset="8923742">The Committee has no resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.257" offset="8932937">It depends upon what is brought to its attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.916" offset="8951641">It can only inquire by way of interrogation such as this and trying to reach some conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.506" offset="8977972">When an applicant refuses to answer a question, an applicant who is asking for a recommendation certifying to their integrity and honesty and ability to practice law and their willingness to uphold institution to this country in so far as the practice requires, certainly the Committee is not in the position to sign their name for certification of this particular applicant is prepared to and should be admitted to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.230" offset="9076820">And that’s what is the issue in this case, it’s whether or not a Committee should be required to certify to something which they don’t know is true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.089" offset="9104300">And which goes to the very heart at least, we think of the soundest of our judicial system and its future usage in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.696" offset="9134707">Now, if I may be excuse for having raised my voice, I will proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.389" offset="9161456">The whole matter here, Your Honor, it seems to us is that the requirements which counsel says we have rejected and counsel says we are ignoring of seeking after political beliefs, of seeking after what does this particular applicant think about is wholly outside of an alley in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.204" offset="9264797">A Committee can only bring in an applicant and say now, what do you believe about this and then you have to make a judgment factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.467" offset="9301786">Do you think it is a good idea to carry for exposures to be carried into the courtroom, to carry into the United States Congress chambers?</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.827" offset="11839216">In other words, whether or not, the right of the State to ascertain if the character of a person who wants to be admitted to practice law is such, they should be admitted is of sufficient importance to entrust, to require to that particular person make a disclosure of their true beliefs and positions and expectations if they are permitted to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.769" offset="11926988">We think the answer should be that in fact the State does have that right and whatever minor, as they say, that advice to the minor exposures required by this question is a very small price for the applicant to pay who seeks the privilege of a practicing attorney in the courts of the State and who should assume a responsibilities is that you go with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.637" offset="12022491">Now, I’ll just say one thing in closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.104" offset="12032313">I realize that an answer to this question is not going to do very much the way of catching anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.439" offset="12057704">But I do say that for this Court to say to the young law students of our country for this Court to declare by formal opinion that an inquiry as to whether the beliefs of those law students, their beliefs are such that they are permitted to espouse a belief in the overthrow of the Government by violence, the fact that this Court was willing to say that we don’t consider of enough importance what you believe in this respect, what you’re actually are thinking in this respect to permit the Committee to inquire of it, it seems to me would indeed be an invitation to the young law students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.076" offset="12216216">To think the practice of law really is pretty much something like as exemplified in some of our recent court trials.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.034" offset="12564062">But Question 27 is not just a blend or general list of all your organizations, it has written right across it that there is right answer and a wrong answer and that you’re supposed to make a judgment about these organizations you list in Question 25 that you pointed out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.953" offset="13427775">No, she has already listed that she belonged to the Young Democrats and the Young Republicans but what they want to know is whether she believes in the overthrow of the Government and we submit -- by force and violence, that’s correct and we submit that they could ask whether do you believe in the Equal Protection Clause and whether you believe in complying with the orders of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.347" offset="13517322">The beliefs of a right wing, of a left wing, of a middle of the road are really inviolate we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.941" offset="13547729">And when the purpose is such, as it is here to seek out beliefs to use that as a trigger to an inquiry and to beliefs, then that question is on its face and it has been supplemented on the record by the Committee not worth answering.</text>
