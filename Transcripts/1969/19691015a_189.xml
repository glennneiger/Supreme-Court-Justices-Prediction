            <label>Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger</label>
            <text syncTime="24.466" offset="201226">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.973" offset="207287">This case raises the question as to whether the petitioner’s right against self-incrimination is violated by compliance with Title 26 United States Code, Section 4705, and the regulations enacted by the Department of the Treasury pursuant to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.281" offset="292446">That Section is the narcotics order form provision of the Harrison Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.415" offset="317001">Petitioner’s position, one that is apparently not disputed by the Government, is that the order form procedure or scheme necessarily includes record keeping aspects and information keeping aspects, and that to a person such as petitioner, this must result in the disclosure of information which is available to law enforcement officers both state and federal and which can provide a link in the chain of criminal prosecution for violation of federal and state narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.874" offset="474885">The facts in the case are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.486" offset="485334">There were two sales of heroin by the petitioner to a federal undercover narcotics agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.530" offset="521488">The narcotics agent did not supply an order form to the petitioner for the sales, and the defendant was sentenced to the minimum mandatory term of five years on each count to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.301" offset="584600">I think before a discussion of the legal question is involved -- comes up that we should discuss the scheme of the statute as it specifically relates to the order form provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.635" offset="645935">A person who is registered to deal in narcotics and has paid an occupation tax can apply to the treasury department for order forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.910" offset="695045">These order forms, a copy of which is printed as appendix C to the petitioner’s brief, comes in a book of ten which is in a book which looks like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.810" offset="754604">The order form is what is called executed by the potential buyer of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.505" offset="781354">That is he puts his name and address on the order form and he lists the narcotics items that he would like to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.847" offset="826807">He then submits -- the form is issued in triplicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.990" offset="847287">He then submits the original and the triplicate to the potential buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.379" offset="880933">The buyer must supply the order and on this order form, he must indicate the amount of drugs that he has supplied and the date on which he supplied them.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.255" offset="936417">Prior to the time that this order form is given to the buyer, or at least at the time of the sale, the seller’s name and address must be entered on the front of the order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.128" offset="1003917">No provision makes clear who has the responsibility of filling in the seller’s name and address, but it is clear from regulation 151.185 that the seller does have the obligation of supplying on the order form the amount of narcotics that he sells and the date on which the sale is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.189" offset="1112168">The original and triplicate of the form are retained by the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.387" offset="1140903">The duplicate is retained by the buyer of the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.736" offset="1158353">One of the copies retained by the seller is sent to the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.899" offset="1178937">He must keep the other copy in his possession for two years, and during that time, the order form is available for inspection by any federal or state law enforcement official.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.622" offset="1241840">The self-incrimination aspect of the order form obviously is that the seller himself must write on the order form the amount of narcotics that he supplies and the date upon which he supplied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.780" offset="1310490">That would give law enforcement officials information concerning violation of 21 U.S.C. Section 173, 174 which is the illegal importation of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.254" offset="1376423">The Section 4704 (a) which is the transfer of drugs outside of the original stamped package, of course there are violations of state statutes as well, and since this transaction took place in New York, it is important to know that the New York narcotic statute makes it a felony to deal in heroin of more than eighth of an ounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.900" offset="1483003">So that the order form provision would reveal to state officials that the petitioner in this case committed a felony as well as a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.194" offset="2072116">And regulation 151.185 specifically states that it is the vendor of the narcotics that must fill in that information, so that the form even assuming that the buyer of the narcotics would be the person to fill in the seller’s name.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.846" offset="4866800">But it’s our position that he did not have to request it in the first instance, because had he done so and had he received it, he would have been obliged to fill it out, and he would have incriminated himself. Since that obligation would have been thrust on him had he received it, our argument is that he does not have to take that risk as this Court has stated in Leary by even asking for in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.744" offset="4978395">In the Leary case, this Court held that Leary did not even have to go to try to register because the Government’s position in Leary was that if Leary had gone to try to register so that he could buy marihuana, nobody would’ve known that he would’ve -- that he was revealing information because he wouldn’t have been permitted to register and nobody would’ve seen the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.785" offset="5078497">But this Court stated in Leary, that Leary didn’t even have to go through the steps of beginning his registration because that might have subjected him under the statutory scheme as it was intended by Congress to function to the risk of having to supply that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.313" offset="5148609">And I think that the Leary case directly covers the question that Your Honor has asked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.527" offset="5169507">He does not have to begin the process because to begin it would thrust the obligation on him to supply that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.133" offset="5231888">The -- I might also add that the decisions of this Court treat the order form provision as an inherent part of the taxing scheme in addition to the legislative history treating it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.436" offset="5309106">One of the -- another problem in this case is whether the statute was directed to those inherently suspect of criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.913" offset="5343065">This was a question which was raised by the Circuit in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.638" offset="5361873">Once again, I believe that the Leary decision, the reasoning in the Leary decision, covers that problem in this case too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.600" offset="5401788">The Court held in Leary that those who could register to deal in marihuana would do so, because if they didn’t register they would be acting illegally and the penalties were quite severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.298" offset="5460616">Therefore, this Court was willing to assume that everybody who could register would register, and that the only people who would be faced with the self-incrimination problem would be the people who could not register, and therefore you would have a distinct class of people involved in criminal activities that the self-incrimination problem would be directed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.725" offset="5554239">This point is apparently not disputed by the Government because on page 11 in its brief, the Government states that anybody who could register under state law would also -- well, nobody could register under federal law, unless they were permitted to register under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.620" offset="5633860">Thus, we have the assumption that everybody who could register would register and falls within the Leary reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.057" offset="5663640">Of course, this case deals with heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.745" offset="5674402">Since under the statutes of relating to narcotics as they are presently constituted, there is no legal dealing in heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.099" offset="5719751">Therefore, the application of this statute to any heroin transaction automatically results in the application of it to a class of individuals that is suspect of criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.815" offset="5798640">The Government in its brief indicates that to avoid violation, and I think this goes back to Mr. Justice Marshall’s question, to avoid violation you don’t -- the defendant need not act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.323" offset="5880665">I think that reasoning was put to rest by this Court in Marchetti where the Government argued that he need not gamble once he’s -- the defendant need not gamble once he has registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.294" offset="5944508">The Court said that that is not true where if he complies with the statute, he would reveal information which would subject him to criminal penalties under on other sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.874" offset="5994872">And I think that the same reasoning applies to this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1479.437" offset="6021099">Come to think of that reasoning would apply to this case, only if there were federal statute that required some seller who sold somebody narcotics without receiving an order form to report that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.049" offset="6091525">That’s the missing link in this case, isn’t it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.599" offset="6397785">I think petitioner’s arguments rest on an assumption which is demonstrably false, and which it seems to me has informed much of the questioning during that time of her argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.160" offset="6448044">That is to say, the assumption that petitioner had an opportunity to provide the Government with incriminating information, and then declined to do so in order to protect his Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.348" offset="6492766">Such arguments could be entertained only with the order forms for which Section 4705 (a) provides are actually received by the seller of narcotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.447" offset="6537174">It is clear from the Government’s proof in this case, proof entirely independent of anything that petitioner said, or any information that he may have provided to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.543" offset="6581582">It’s clear from that proof that petitioner received no order form from the purchaser, a government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.226" offset="6604257">As a matter of fact, it is clear from the statutory scheme as a matter of law that neither petitioner nor anyone willing to purchase narcotics from him could lawfully have obtained order forms for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.444" offset="6661099">In these circumstances, it is entirely premature to ask what Fifth Amendment question might be raised in a case where an order form is actually presented and an obligation to disclose than arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.902" offset="9722964">Narcotic drugs while they are very dangerous to individuals, addictive, still have important medical uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.788" offset="9750549">And thousands of pounds, hundreds of thousands of pounds of opium are imported into this country legally every year for manufacture into various drugs, not including heroin, and use in medical trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.581" offset="9813661">Those legally imported drugs are supervised from the moment of entry into the United States to the moment of their consumption by use of the reports made on triplicates by the hundreds of thousands of legal users of narcotic drugs every month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.774" offset="9890461">That is the function, if you like, of the reporting aspect of the order form requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.813" offset="9914598">The function of the receipt aspect of the order form requirement which we’re talking about here is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.219" offset="9944273">By requiring that you receive an order form, the Government is in effect saying there shall be not sales but legal sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.685" offset="9978128">You can only obtain an order form lawfully to use in a narcotics transaction and you can only use the order form lawfully if the sale is a legal one under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.225" offset="10036224">That being the case, the absence of an order form, the failure to receive an order form if the Government can prove it in any narcotics case, is immediate proof that the sale was an illegal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.543" offset="10093589">And it is that separate function which petitioner seeks to affiliate to the question of information gathering, and thus draw a conjurer circle around him self.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.602" offset="10137788">And if I may repeat that phrase that Justice Holmes use so long ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.547" offset="10157537">I think that it could then be quite clear that this case is not in the line of cases which begun in this Court with Albertson versus Subversive Activities Control Board, those cases held in effect that the Fifth Amendment forbids statutes whose usual impact is to make a separate crime out of an individuals failure to report his criminal acts to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.099" offset="10255757">Here, the violation of the statute consists not in failure to report, but in the positive act of selling narcotics to a person who has not proved his eligibility as a legal purchaser by presentation of an official order form for the narcotics brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.418" offset="10321063">The question of reporting, as I’ve just said, never arises in that context, because order forms cannot be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.583" offset="10353664">It’s only after an order form has been presented in circumstances not present here, and in which the overwhelming majority of transactions are entirely legal that any such question arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.496" offset="10401311">And I may say Justice Stewart, in response to the remarks that you made before about this being heroin and to that extent the heroin statute, in the processing of these forms, there is no particular distinction made as to what drug is reported on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.540" offset="10465573">There’s no different color for an order form that might be used for one drug, then for another there’s no different filing system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.387" offset="13104880">Section 4721 and 22 imposed the obligation to register in the particular circumstances we’re talking about, probably the relevant obligation as to register as a wholesaler or as a retailer of narcotic drugs, and those sections made quite clear that the only person who may register are persons lawfully entitled to sell narcotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.110" offset="13219819">That is persons who would violate no law of the state if they sold narcotic drugs generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.577" offset="13381674">There is no requirement that he identify what drugs he means to purchase or how many.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.942" offset="13403094">Obviously that would be impractical, as I mentioned before, there are 400,000 registrants under this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.329" offset="13516675">The lawful purchaser then receives these order forms in blank when he has occasion to make the purchase of any drug, he fills it out in the manner that you can see in appendix C of petitioner’s brief, and sends it to the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.386" offset="13588877">He may or may not put the seller’s name in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.971" offset="13619284">It is I think, worthy of note that if he uses that order form for an unlawful purpose which would include the purchase of a drug he’s not lawfully entitled to purchase, heroin, he would be committing a felony under Section 4705 (g) which is not a provision in issue again in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.885" offset="13722937">When the seller receives that form, it is I would say in all cases, if you were to put to me a hypothetical in which the seller received the form calling for the purchase of heroin which is physically possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.465" offset="13785213">A purchaser could write in heroin on the form, I would have to respond yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.647" offset="13801932">That is conceivable although we don’t know it’s ever happened, so I can say at least in all but the very remotest of situations, when he receives that order form, it is a certificate that the transaction that’s about to take place is a legal transaction and it serves that important function in its absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.806" offset="13902555">One knows that the transaction which has taken place is an illegal transaction and that without need for any information on the part of the seller of any type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.169" offset="13944038">That is the Government’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.037" offset="13951561">We believe the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.628" offset="13961906">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.848" offset="13974758">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.783" offset="13978520">I will address briefly to three questions which were raised in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.690" offset="13998164">First, Mr. Justice Stewart spoke of a missing link.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.197" offset="14016136">I would suggest that in this case while the statute is not identical to those of the prior cases in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.089" offset="14055737">The difference is not material and should not be dispositive, because Leary assumes that the statute will function as it was intended to do by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.494" offset="14109341">To do that or to interpret that statute in any other way or to apply it in any other way, undermines the rules of -- that were established with respect to the Fifth Amendment in the series of cases prior to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.928" offset="14167124">So we come to determine what -- how that missing link affects these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.472" offset="14197217">It is our position that the Fifth Amendment right is the same here as it has been in prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.972" offset="14227310">Although the very words of the Section which provide the criminal penalty do not include the provisions requiring the information, the rest of the statute requires the incriminatory information and on the congressional scheme, it must be interpreted as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.133" offset="14327933">Thus, if the defendant receives the order form as has been stated by the Government, he must give the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.300" offset="14368580">His position then is no different if he doesn’t ask for it with the knowledge that if he receives it, he will have to supply the incriminating information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.947" offset="14419153">He merely can stop, as this Court has said previously at the initial stages of the proceeding, rather than waiting until other statutes come in to play in a different factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.816" offset="14486653">The Government has indicated in its argument that the application of the order form procedure to the heroin transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.586" offset="14533674">The order form procedure has its purpose the disclosure of information as applied to the heroin transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.808" offset="14570559">This must always result in the disclosure of incriminating information as to the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.098" offset="14599816">We are not concerned here with the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.617" offset="14621863">The effect of Section 4705 is to give the transaction an appearance of legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.373" offset="14656867">Since it says that a sale can be made with an order form, while the provision -- while the sale may be illegal under other sections that is precisely the problem raised by falling into 4705 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.585" offset="14725726">The transaction appears to be legal and complying with it appears to make it justifiable and legal at the same time complying with it reveals the violations of the other statutes which would be violated by heroin transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.790" offset="14806497">Again I can only indicate that the missing link is not substantial because compliance in the receipt of the order form cannot be separated because of the congressional intent with the statute from the information giving aspects of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.521" offset="14893432">Even though another statute may come into play in a different factual context, and that other statute may also violate the Fifth Amendment, this statute does too if we look at the full implications of compliance with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3716.858" offset="14970755">et me put a hypothetical question to you, Mrs. Bamberger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.375" offset="14984861">Suppose a state decided to simplify its procedures, and perhaps this hypothetical is too simplistic but let’s try it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.102" offset="15023731">Simplify its procedures for admission of lawyers from other states who moved into the state in question and said that admission to the bar could be obtained upon filing a certificate by the applicant that he was admitted a bar in some other state giving the date of his admission of the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.048" offset="15115577">The man wants to practice in this state, but he hasn’t had time to go to law school and he doesn’t want to take the trouble and so he just -- but he’s determined to practice law there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.511" offset="15169390">Now, he says he’s confronted with the choice of either committing perjury by filing a false certificate that he submitted in Florida or Georgia, or not engaging in practice of law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.727" offset="15222262">Would you think that that kind of a statute poses these problems?</text>

            <label>Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger</label>
            <text syncTime="3785.521" offset="15245458">No, I don’t Your Honor, because that statute does not make his -- does not give his act in appearance of legality by indicating that he has violated some other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.071" offset="15303659">If he were to file such an affidavit, he would be practicing law illegally because it had not been properly admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.047" offset="15339604">But it wouldn’t, the statute itself would not compel him to reveal information which would violate another statute, which would indicate a violation of another statute.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3821.202" offset="15388191">But it confronts him with the choice that either not being able to practice law in that state or committing perjury in order to get this simplified overnight admission.</text>
