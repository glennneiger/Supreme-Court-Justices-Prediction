            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="16.323" offset="168626">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.009" offset="183359">This criminal tax case which is now and re-argument comes to this Court on direct appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.563" offset="225573">The case presents the situation in which I think it can be said that both defense counsel and the Government agreed that the trial court acted arbitrarily and perhaps mistakenly in granting a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.119" offset="283878">That same judge some month’s later apparently recognizing his error in some way refused to permit the Government to retry the case on grounds of double jeopardy and it is from that decision that the Government now appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.751" offset="342392">I would hope to devote the bulk of my argument today to the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.623" offset="365902">But I would like to at the outset to address myself very briefly before stating the facts of this case to the jurisdictional aspect of this case, that is to the Government’s right to appeal the trial judge’s dismissal on grounds of double jeopardy under Section 3731 of Title 18 of United State Code which is known as Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.308" offset="456600">I imagine that the members of this Court remember that on argument last term, the Court asked the Government counsel in effect how the Government could bring this appeal when Section 3731 allows the Government to appeal from the granting of a motion in bar only “when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="108.474" offset="537266">And when in this case that the defendant had technically been put in jeopardy at the first board of trial in the sense that the jury had been impaneled before the trial was dismissed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="117.596" stopTime="124.782">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="117.596" offset="573733">Now this actual setting is true I suppose in most of the mistrial cases we encounter in the courts in this country.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_b_stone" startTime="124.782" stopTime="343.190">
            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="124.782" offset="602467">That’s right and that’s precisely the point I’m about to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.434" offset="621066">Of course, at the time of the original argument, it was still undecided by this Court whether the phrase not been put in jeopardy in Section 3731, meant jeopardy literally or whether it meant jeopardy in the full constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.389" offset="684910">In other words, whether the jurisdictional and the merits question and a case like this would be essentially the same question and of course that question was decided by this Court at the end of the term in the Sisson case which was handed down subsequent to the original argument of Jorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.670" offset="746036">Now in Sisson, this Court decided that the Criminal Appeals Act forecloses appeal from the motion in bar granted after jeopardy has literally attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.935" offset="787101">And I think it can be very fairly be said that the court in Sisson placed considerably weight on the Government’s very candid admission that it had always assumed this restrictive interpretation of the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.905" offset="843003">The Government had always assumed that the Criminal Appeals Act restricted the Government and precisely this way and the Government had never sought to appeal for motion in bar granted after jeopardy has attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.425" offset="893053">I think, however, that we can say with equal cantor that we have never hesitated to appeal from the granting of a motion in bar in the situation like that present one.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.867" offset="934849">That is a situation in which the defendant was placed in literal jeopardy at the first trial under circumstances allowing him constitutionally to be tried a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.306" offset="976645">But in which the defendant has not been placed in jeopardy at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.101" offset="991796">The trial at which the motion we are appealing from was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.374" offset="1004857">In other words, we have always read the phrase “not been put in jeopardy” in Section 3731 to refer to jeopardy at the trial at which the motion under consideration was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.248" offset="1056371">And as the Chief Justice just suggested to hold otherwise would mean that the Government could never appeal a dismissal on grounds of double jeopardy subsequent to a mistrial because a mistrial is usually granted after a jury has been impaneled and literal jeopardy has attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.719" offset="1134216">And this would be so even though the predecessor statute on which Section 3731 was based which I submit was a much more restrictive statute in Section 3731 and evidence even a greater policy against Government appeals in criminal cases indeed Section 3731, that predecessor statute allowed appeals only from special pleas in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.500" offset="1229406">And the classical and practically the only example of a special plea in bar was a plea of convict or acquit which is the plea of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.969" offset="1263261">I think even the most restrictive view of the phrase motion in bar which was evidenced by Mr. Justice Stewart’s opinion in the Mersky case makes it clear that it has always been assumed that this was -- that a plea of double jeopardy was a motion in bar even under the most restrictive definition and to refuse to allow the Government to appeal on Section 3731 grounds in this case would be simply to read convict or acquit double jeopardy out of the definition of special plea in bar and leave that phrase and the statute totally meaningless and as we state on our supplemental brief on this point, there are at least two cases decided by this Court in which the Government was allowed to appeal from an adverse determination of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.843" offset="1438699">I’m referring to the Tateo case of 377 U.S. and the Oppenheimer case in which there was a jurisdictional objection and to the appeal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="347.956" offset="1495228">That’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.937" offset="1519156">Now, I’m going to state the facts on this very brief record in rather considerable detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.420" offset="1537024">I don’t think it would take very long because I think it is important to understand exactly what went on in the courtroom prior to the granting of a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.486" offset="1577357">We’re in the District of Utah before the Chief Judge of the District Judge Ritter.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.941" offset="1599091">An information is filed against Mr. Jorn who was charged in 25 counts with having prepared false and fraudulent income tax returns for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.593" offset="1637752">Specifically, Mr. Jorn was charged with having either invented or grossly exaggerated deductions to which the taxpayers and Mr. Jorn’s customers were not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.858" offset="1674846">A case was called to trial in August 27, 1968 and a jury was selected and sworn during the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.476" offset="1701282">In the afternoon, the United States attorney indicated outside of the presence of the jury that he wish to amend the 25-count information and reduce it down to 11 counts, all of which involve the amounts varying roughly between about $200 and $700.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.619" offset="1757811">Now the court’s answer to the prosecution upon hearing that the indictment was -- the information was being reduced down to 11 counts and I quote now from page 34 of the record is, “Maybe if we give you a little more time, you will dismiss some more.”</text>
            <text syncTime="429.600" offset="1821759">This is a whole bundle of two-bit stuff that looks to me like.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="433.760" offset="1838373">Whole bundle of two-bit stuff that looks to me like.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.138" offset="1851956">This is the judge addressing the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.071" offset="1863659">I had the observation here that this Judge Ritter’s first remark to counsel on the record and it illustrates what I think and feel to be described as a consistently hostile attitude towards this prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.087" offset="1911724">The first witness in the case was revenue agent who is called simply to identify the returns under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.639" offset="1933876">And after immediate stipulation that the returns were in fact authentic, the revenue officials stepped down and the real witness was called and this witness who was one of a series of the main Government witnesses was one of the taxpayers for whom Mr. Jorn had allegedly made a fraudulent return.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.751" offset="2002422">As soon as this witness took the stand, defense counsel Mr. Morrill addressed the court as follows and I’m now on page 40 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.727" offset="2034291">In view of the transcript in the preliminary hearing in this matter, it is my feeling that each of these taxpayers should be warned us to his constitutional rights before testifying because I feel there is a possibility of a violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.026" offset="2087476">This is defense counsel’s suggestion as to the witnesses who are about to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.618" offset="2109837">And the judge response to that suggestion as follows, “Well, we wouldn’t want anybody to talk himself into a federal penitentiary years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="508.201" offset="2136168">So what the court has to say to you is this and I will not read the following pages of the record in which the judge very clearly and emphatically, and what I would call the strongest possible terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.049" offset="2179532">It advises the prospective witnesses of their right not to testify for fear of incriminating themselves and of their right to have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.353" offset="2208789">Their right to have a lawyer appointed for them even though they’re not criminal defendants before they testify in this case involving another defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.314" offset="2240658">And incidentally in spite of the fact the prosecution had given insurances that he would--that the Government did not plan to go against the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.507" offset="2281409">The judge then addresses the witness and say, this is now in page 41 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.303" offset="2300635">“Well, what do you want to do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="550.960" offset="2307218">And the witness responds, “Your Honor, my wife and I have had pointed out to us that our returns had information in them that we know is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.833" offset="2334699">And we have admitted this and I would admit it further in this court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="561.227" offset="2348283">The judge responds, “Have you talk to a lawyer?”</text>
            <text syncTime="575.198" offset="2404185">The witness says, “No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="566.200" offset="2404080">The court says, “I’m not going to let you admit it any further in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.857" offset="2403976">That’s all there is about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.121" offset="2403871">The admissions you have already made were very likely made without telling you what your constitutional rights are.”</text>
            <text syncTime="577.154" offset="2412022">The court says, “What is that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="579.332" offset="2420694">And the witness says, “We were advised at the time we were first contacted by the Internal Revenue Service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="584.949" offset="2443160">And judge responds, “If you were, you’re the only taxpayer in the United States that has been so advised because they do not do that when they first contact you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="592.627" offset="2473880">And at that point, the judge explains his version of having Internal Revenue Service goes about intimidating and incriminating prospective defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.243" offset="2504391">Now the judge excuses the witness at this point in terms to the United States’ attorney and say, “Are all your witnesses in this shape?”</text>
            <text syncTime="605.965" offset="2527274">And the United State’s attorney replies, “Your Honor, by the time any of these witnesses were contacted, there was a criminal investigation not of the witnesses but up of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.440" offset="2565099">It is true that the Internal Revenue Service does not require this morning until after first meeting with the special agent, but it is the practice in this office.”</text>
            <text syncTime="622.260" offset="2592371">They do give them this warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.317" offset="2596655">It’s not required but they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.502" offset="2605432">The judge then expresses some doubt as to whether the warning could have been sufficient, there’s more colloquy between the court and the United States’ attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.280" offset="2632495">And now, we are on page 43 of the record, and I’m about to conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.727" offset="2646288">The judge once again expresses his view that this case never should have been brought because the trivial amounts involved, and finally ends the colloquy with this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.183" offset="2680142">Well, I’ll tell you what’s going to happen to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.486" offset="2689337">“Ladies and gentlemen it wouldn’t be necessary for you to attend the court any further on this matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="651.026" offset="2707519">And at that point the judge dismisses the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.593" offset="2721729">Judge then requires all the taxpayers including the witnesses who had been previously separated and excluded from the courtroom to return to the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.203" offset="2752136">And we’re now in page 44 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.562" offset="2761644">Once again for the better part of three pages he advises them with respect to their right to remain silent, their right not to testify and his decision not to allow the trial to proceed until such time that he personally has had further opportunity to suggest to them the un-wisdom of putting themselves in danger of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.831" offset="2834683">And finally the judge says, “So this case is vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.303" offset="2844609">The setting is vacated this afternoon and it would be calendared again.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.340" offset="2860701">And before it is calendared again, I’m going to have these witnesses in and talk to them again before I’ll permit them to testify.”</text>
            <text syncTime="696.858" offset="2890794">And of course prior to the impaneling of another jury and retrial case of the case after the sufficient warning to these witnesses have been given, the judge granted a motion for the defense to bar retrial grants double jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.930" offset="3163094">To begin with, I think it’s not unreasonable to contend that the declaration of the mistrial was directly attributable, a direct consequence of the defense’s request on page 40 of the record that quote, “each of these taxpayers should be warned as to his constitutional rights before testifying.”</text>
            <text syncTime="781.114" offset="3227878">Now, I admit Judge Ritter took the bull by the horns before defense counsel had sufficient opportunity to explain what he had in mind with that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.429" offset="3261106">He didn’t get to elaborate on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.861" offset="3278764">I supposed he may have hoped simply that Judge Ritter would warn the taxpayers of their rights in language sufficiently strong that it would inhibit their testimony which would be for the benefit of defense counsel’s client, Jorn.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.220" offset="3584293">Or I suppose conceivably the defense counsel might have anticipated exactly what happened in this case that a mistrial would be declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.630" offset="3609893">I can imagine he really conceive that the judge would then refuse to allow further trial and grant a double jeopardy but that’s I guess not be on the realm either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.441" offset="5885158">You can’t appeal the motion granted at the trial at which the defendant was placed in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.961" offset="5923192">But we have always thought that you can appeal a motion granted at the subsequent trial in which he has not been put in jeopardy in spite of the fact that he was in jeopardy at the prior trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.731" offset="5970317">And that is consistent with our practice and I think nothing in the Act or this Court’s decision in Sisson dictates otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.602" offset="5997798">I want to go briefly into the alternative ground we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.533" offset="6017546">The other way to look at this case is to assume not that the mistrial was declared in response to either sides request of motion but simply that the jury was discharge as a result of Judge Ritter’s excessively protective attitude toward the witnesses and the question at this point is whether the prosecution must fail as a result of this judicial arbitrariness even though it’s all agreed there was no misconduct in the part of the prosecution and no conceivable effort on the part of either the prosecution or the trial judge to harass the defendant or denying him his rights to be tried before that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.101" offset="6147741">And I submit to this Court that even if this is the view taken of this record that it is simply a question of whether the burden of Judge Ritter’s arbitrariness must fall on the prosecution in spite of the lack of any harassment of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.762" offset="6198418">The rationale of the double jeopardy clause and the decisions of this court did not require such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.246" offset="6220361">What the court has always done in this mistrial situation is to apply a balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.567" offset="6241677">It is not directly controlled by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.936" offset="6251081">It is instead determined by a balancing test in which the defendant’s rights are given very liberal interpretation but in which in the absence of any indication of harassment of the defendant or excessively unfair aid to the prosecution through a mistrial, retrial is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.188" offset="6332165">And I think that this Court’s too much recent decisions in the mistrial area illustrate exactly how this Court has balanced its interest in the Downum case for example decided at 372 U.S. which is the only case in which this Court has refused to allow retrial subsequent to an aborted trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.464" offset="6401233">The prosecutor allowed the jury to be sworn before the key witnesses had arrived and when it became clear that the witnesses were not going to show up, the prosecutor moved for a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.566" offset="6437595">In that case, if retrial has been allowed it would have unfairly aided the prosecution improving a case that it could not have approved originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.259" offset="6468420">But this case I submit is not like Downum but is instead on all force with the Gori case decided by this Court at 367 U.S. In Gori, the trial judge in what was characterized by this Court and the Court of Appeals as over eager concern for possible prejudice to the defendant declared a mistrial because he feared the line of questioning by the prosecution was about to result in a prejudicial disclosure of the defendants’ prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.724" offset="6574268">And just as here the defendant in that case neither urged nor acquiesced in the discharge of the jury but the mistrial was the result of judicial arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.810" offset="6606660">And in the absence of any evidence that the defendant had been harassed, this Court refused to terminate the prosecution merely because the trial judge acted arbitrarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.212" offset="6640201">Now I think to have done otherwise in that case or to do otherwise in this case would really hang on the prosecution pure element of chance which is the element of chance the judge will make some error in spite of the fact that the defendants’ double jeopardy rights’ really are not intended by anyone to be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.738" offset="6722330">And for this several reasons I believe that this Court ought to reverse the district judges’ decision and allow the prosecution to proceed again within a further file in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.146" offset="6908008">The offset I believe that this question before the Court is really a question of jurisdiction and that under Section 3731, the Government does not have a right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.126" offset="6991914">In Sisson, recently decided by this Court and mentioned by Mr. Stone, this Court clearly stated that once jeopardy has attached and appealed, it does not lie for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.889" offset="7066937">The Government here is arguing something that frankly is a little difficult for me to understand that if the jeopardy we are talking about is the jeopardy in the second trial, then no appeal would lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.174" offset="7140080">But if it’s the jeopardy in the first trial, there is an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.506" offset="7157426">This it seems to me does considerable violence to any possible interpretation of a legislative history of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.599" offset="7205804">This would make it frankly so that the defendant by the timing of this motion can determine whether or not there is an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.573" offset="7245615">If we have waited until the jury had been sworn in the second case and then made a motion based on double jeopardy, then the Government would admit there could have been no appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.126" offset="8787884">In other words, it was tried, they were the Government and they were in defense rightly or wrongly, they made the ruling as they did but still.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.385" offset="8828949">But this Court I should not say it was not with in the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.581" offset="8841697">It is ought to -- do you think it would be under the posture then under cases we have decided under double jeopardy?</text>

            <label>Mr. Denis R. Morrill</label>
            <text syncTime="2194.807" offset="8882552">On the constitutional issue of double jeopardy set forth in Downum and Gori and Tateo, I believe this action by the judge while you could characterize it as not being arbitrary still was in no way as set forth in those cases favoring the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.125" offset="8999894">If you break the judges’ action down in its two parts first, he felt that the witnesses should not testify until they’ve been warned and he then said “I’m not going to let you testify until you have been warned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.494" offset="9053393">And then at second part he turns and dismisses the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.561" offset="9073664">Well if you stopped after the first part, clearly there were many alternatives available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.194" offset="9100100">This could have been done in an hour’s time, they could have consulted counsel, the trial could have gone on but predisposed as the judge was to refuse to allow them to testify had the trial have been going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.382" offset="9156942">There is no doubt but what it would have been a directed acquittal for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.547" offset="9177527">There were no witnesses and there was no way that the trial could continue on the part of the Government at that time once he decided that he was not going to let those witnesses testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.044" offset="9223502">So it would be my position then that any solicitude on the part of anyone by the judge was on the part of the prosecution and this I think fits squarely within Downum that the jury was dismissed in order to allow the prosecution to more favorable opportunity to convict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.200" offset="9508133">I believe my position would have to be that the government is powerless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.715" offset="9526209">That the risk of this judicial arbitrariness, this defendant was entitled to be tried by the jury impaneled to hear this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.515" offset="9557452">And if for some reason other than his own conduct this is prevented, I believe that the cases of this Court would have to hold that he had been placed in jeopardy and a second prosecution would be twice in jeopardy and prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.311" offset="9732577">However, I believe on the facts and the record and subjectively since I was there that there was no way the remarks by counsel in this case could have foreseeable precipitated the action that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.070" offset="9803630">I frankly did have an interest in seeing that these witnesses were warned because I intended to show that it was they, and not my client who had committed the crime and this was the reason I felt they should be warned of their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.614" offset="9889834">So while it is open to interpretation that my remarks caused the action of the judge, I think that it was not case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.079" offset="9935705">I think the record indicates a predisposition of the judge prior to the time I made any remarks with regard to this particular prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.112" offset="9995786">Counsel for the Government has mentioned there was a pretrial and possibly, I mean it was a preliminary hearing and possibly this could have been taken care of earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.042" offset="10039568">Judge Ritter did not hear the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.288" offset="10056495">And the record in the preliminary hearing as he stated was the cause of dismissing of many of the counts of the information and it was my -- that was where I developed my feeling that it may have been the witnesses rather than the defendant who actually committed a crime and this is why I made the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.746" offset="10170389">I suppose it could have been made at an earlier time but as a fact, it wasn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.551" offset="10209573">Going the jurisdictional question, again, I believe the legislative history of Section 3731, which was discussed by this Court and system, while it is ambiguous in places, indicates that the legislature in passing this Criminal Appeals Act was very concerned that it be limited strictly to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.792" offset="10354500">There are remarks in the legislative history indicating that the -- at least some of the senators debating this Bill understood the difference between the attachment of jeopardy and constitutional double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.568" offset="10445615">I think you must separate those two questions because jeopardy attaches and there is nothing unconstitutional about the attachment of jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.289" offset="10488560">It attaches every time the jury is formed, so that’s one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.676" offset="10514056">The Constitution comes into play on a proposed retrial, then the motion is that the defendant is being put twice in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.774" offset="10562435">It seems to me that if you argue that jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.057" offset="10583646">And this has been decided at least by four members of this Court in Sisson if you -- that jeopardy in Section 3731 must mean the attachment of jeopardy, not the constitutional standard because the Constitution was there and will be there long before the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.652" offset="10665984">There was no reason for the legislature to incorporate a constitutional standard in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.085" offset="10695764">It was there and they couldn’t change what the Constitution means by double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.042" offset="10739545">I think the legislative history indicates that this question of jeopardy was -- the words put in jeopardy were placed in the statute to strictly limit an appeal on the part of the Government to cases in which there had been no jury impaneled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.247" offset="12260394">But I also wanted to respond to the defenses point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.675" offset="12278053">And I think this really that defense and Mr. Justice White are both struck as really the Government is as well by the arbitrary effect that the Criminal Appeals Act has in terms of a motion which is not based in any way on the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.339" offset="12348688">It can be appealed from if it is granted at one time but not before jeopardy is attached, but not five minutes later after the jury has been impaneled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.369" offset="12380871">Now, that is a rather peculiar distinction that the Criminal Appeals Act makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.220" offset="12396231">And one which we have accepted but reluctantly the question in this case is whether that arbitrary disposition that the Criminal Appeals Act makes ought to be extended to a situation where it is even more remote and more arbitrary and where we have -- we for in our part had never thought that it ought to be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.434" offset="12485151">I want to say in that regard that this Court, I think clearly recognize both the majority and Justice White’s opinion insist in recognize that the Criminal Appeals Act is quite arbitrary very cryptic in certain ways and indefinite need of modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.716" offset="12550248">And I think very much in response to that Congress was -- the Senate was motivated to pass the amendment to the Criminal Appeals Act which basically makes double jeopardy and the Constitutional issue and the Appeals issue are pretty issue the same and which also puts the vast majority of appealable cases where we think they properly belong in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.958" offset="12655156">That does not control the disposition of this case that the posture right now is the Senate has passed the Bill and its conference in the House there appears to be no opposition to it in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.238" offset="12700296">We have had spend some assurance that it would not be controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.846" offset="12714715">It is attached as a rider to a Bill that has some controversial provisions in it but it is very much hope that this will be definitely law.</text>
