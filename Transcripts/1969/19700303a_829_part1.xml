            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="13.339" offset="156714">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.665" offset="182000">The basic issues in this welfare case have become somewhat clouded by the promulgation of new state welfare regulations since the beginning of the suit by the enactment of a new state statute since the decision below by the promulgation of proposed regulations under that state statute not yet in effect and by the variety of decisions taken by the parties and the amici in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.715" offset="306239">For this reason, I think it useful at the outset to describe and to distinguish several different factual situations that is family situations which are represented by the several plaintiffs and the plaintiff's interveners in this case to identify the legal issues presented in each of those situations, and then to describe what is and what is not still an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.661" offset="425984">Now, the appellants in this Court include the individual plaintiffs below, the individual plaintiff interveners below and the classes which they represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.402" offset="480946">All of these persons are members of households which are eligible to receive or which claim eligibility to receive welfare benefits under the federally supported AFDC program that is Aid to Families with Dependent Children established by the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.598" offset="561716">In each case, the family unit which is eligible for such assistance consists of a mother and her natural children.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.126" offset="603826">The children are under both federal and state law, dependent children because their natural father is continually absent from home.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.021" offset="651473">It is that circumstance that is there being dependent children which renders them eligible for assistance if in addition to being dependent, they are also needy and it is that circumstance which requires the determination of the extent of their need for purposes of determining their assistance levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.806" offset="734647">Now, in each of these cases, each and all, California has taken account in determining need of financial factors relating to the presence in the household of a man who is not the natural or the adoptive father of the dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.854" offset="818761">I will come shortly to the legal basis for California's action for the present, it is important simply to know that the varying relations of the male figure to the children and to the mother create three distinct factual situations which have differing legal import.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.860" offset="894830">The first of these is what we would call the stepfather situation, and the stepfather situation is a case in which the man in the house is ceremonially married to the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.816" offset="950627">This is the case of a plaintiff's interveners, the Bell family and the Sims family.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.310" offset="976645">The second situation is what is in the jargon known as the MARS situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.362" offset="1000782">MARS is an acronym for Man Assuming the Role of Spouse, and this is a situation in which the man is not ceremonially married to the mother and is not the father of any of her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.319" offset="1056684">The third situation is the so called unmarried father situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.450" offset="1077164">The unmarried father situation is a case in which the man is not ceremonially married to the mother but he is the father of at least one of her children in the household.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.782" offset="1118542">Now, that child would not be the AFDC eligible child ordinarily because having both parents in the house it would be not be dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.694" offset="1158144">There are special programs and situations in which he might be but for purposes of these cases, the AFDC child does not include that common child, but the common child is important because of the way California law treats these cases, the matter I will come to shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.919" offset="1223032">The first thing I want to look at in all three situations though briefly is how federal law and particularly the federal HEW regulation which applies to this situation that is 45 CFR Section 203.1 treats these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.893" offset="1306937">Under Federal law, the three cases are treated exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.462" offset="1321253">That is to say that in all of them, if there are any actual contributions by the man, the MARS, the stepfather, the unmarried father to the support of the children, to the upkeep of the house; that is considered income to the household, what is known as the FBU Family Budget Unit, for purposes of computing whether or not the family is needy and the extent of the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.507" offset="1453432">However, no income maybe assumed to be received from any of these three male figures for purposes of determining eligibility as needy or for purposes of determining the extent of the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.162" offset="1532008">And this is so because under the relevant federal regulation, income maybe assumed to be coming to an eligible AFDC family only, if it is coming to a natural or adoptive parent of the AFDC children, or if it is coming to a stepparent who fulfills four criteria, that he be ceremonially married to the mother, that he be legally obligated to support the child, that that legal obligation be under a state law of general applicability, and that the state law be one which requires stepparents to support their stepchildren to the same extent that natural or adoptive parents are required to support their children.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.491" offset="1817370">The HEW regulation would very plainly say no assumption of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.587" offset="1829700">Now, I'm describing the terms of that regulation --</text>

            <text syncTime="436.684" offset="1850075">Now, the result of course is that all of these three situations in terms of assumption in income.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.211" offset="1896260">The MARS, the unmarried father not ceremonially married but the much more important aspect which also applies to stepfathers is that there is no here obligations under state law of general applicability which is to the same extent as the liability which California puts for the support on the natural father.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.900" offset="1970970">I want to come back and take those requirements report in detail because they're the nub of this case, but I want to pass to what California does with these three situations to indicate what I think is still a live issue in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.611" offset="2017782">At the time this suit was filed, California also treated all three situations the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.807" offset="2038575">That is to say that in each and every case, the stepfather, the MARS, the unmarried father, California said that, "any income which he received whether or not he actually contributed to the family was treated as income to the family after certain deductions were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.428" offset="2129063">" He was allowed certain kinds of deductions spelled out in state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.384" offset="2144946">But once those deductions were taken, California law simply assumed that the rest of his income was available to the family and either deducted that amount from the need in order to reduce the welfare grant or if it reduced that so the family was no longer needy within the definition, the family simply became ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.955" offset="2227179">Now--</text>

            <text syncTime="531.487" offset="2229269">Just so I can understand California's view on this, if an unmarried father were living as the husband of another woman and with eleven children of theirs, if he were an unmarried father of a child in an AFDC household with another mother and one child of that family, he would -- his income would be attributable to that second unit?</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="605.750" offset="2526333">We had no such situations in any of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.806" offset="2542634">That is California as far as these cases go, they are dealing with a situation where a man has a stable relationship in this one household.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.217" offset="2572204">Now, I have some very real question as to whether he might be living in one household -- more than one household for the purposes of characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.781" offset="2610448">Obviously, he couldn't be more than one kind of a stepfather.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.202" offset="2624136">He's only ceremonially married to one woman at once except in extreme cases which we might conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.633" offset="2649945">As far as the MARS situation goes, I think he would not meet the MARS definition because he probably couldn't be holding himself out to be married, again and except the extreme situation that we might conjecture in a way, it would be treated as a MARS.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.600" offset="2709817">The unmarried father might very well end up by living in two houses because the only thing that is required is that he live there and that he has a child in the house, and if he in fact splits his time, then, he maybe in two households.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.883" offset="2758928">We have no such situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.997" offset="2767391">Now, the important change in California law is reflected by the enactment effective November 10, 1969 of a new statute which is set out on page 93 in the appendix to our brief which changes the California rules as to the MARS; that is the Man Assuming the Role of Spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.576" offset="2853700">It is no longer the case that his income minus deductions is attributed to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.722" offset="2878255">Now, he is required to make an agreement with the mother relating to the amount which he shall contribute and the statute requires that he makes a contribution which is no less than what it would cost to provide himself with an independent living arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.616" offset="2945860">All of this is governed also by proposed regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.274" offset="2960488">And then -- the effect of the new California statute is to attribute to the family a proportion of the amount of that contribution payment which he is required to maintain.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.979" offset="3019316">Now, let me describe then the effect of this new statute on our three sets of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.238" offset="3052335">One as to the stepfather, absolutely no effect; we are still talking at this point in time about Section 11351 which is a statute which this suit originally challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.772" offset="3098415">It is still in full force in effect as to stepfathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.870" offset="3110849">And therefore as to all past and future matters, that is a live issue here with regard to the stepfather that is the plaintiff interveners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.822" offset="3150660">With respect to them what we seek in this case is a declaration of the validity of the federal regulation under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.377" offset="3188903">A consequent declaration by this Court of the illegality because inconsistent with statute on the constitution of 11351.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.861" offset="3226833">And if the court upholds the federal regulation, there's an end of 11351 because California has admitted from the beginning of this case that it was inconsistent with the federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.002" offset="3267375">The court below so held and we think there's going to be no question about that, and in fact that also will be --</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.244" offset="4740368">Now, coming briefly to two sets of questions of letting in the federal regulation and the constitutional issues, I propose to start with the validity of the federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.758" offset="4786448">I think that that is not with all due respect to the court below, very difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.638" offset="4813928">Let's take a look at what this regulation does and does not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.213" offset="4828244">It does not restrict in anyway state power to decide how much income a family has to have or lack before they are needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.291" offset="4860531">In that sense, the determination of need is left to the state that what is needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.367" offset="4880802">It doesn't restrict in anyway state power to limit how much of a family's need the state is going to supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.641" offset="4901909">As far as this regulation goes maximum grants and that sort of thing are unaffected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.259" offset="4924374">Moreover, it does not restrict in anyways, state power to determine how much income or resources an AFDC family has for the purpose of determining whether it's needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.678" offset="4966066">Insofar as it weighs the actual income received, if any actual income is received, the federal regulation allows the state to treat it as income to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.187" offset="5000129">What it does do is to deny the state, to treat as income and as its resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.187" offset="5032103">Moneys which are not proved to be actually available to the AFDC family except under specified conditions which are designed to assure that the situation is one in which even without proof of actual availability of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.199" offset="5104201">Meaningful economic protection of the AFDC child is support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.944" offset="5123114">Now, I want to make very clear that I'm going to come to the specific regulation in a moment but a vitally important part of this case is that this particular regulation, the HEW regulation is only one sub species, a particularized aspect of a more general HEW regulatory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.823" offset="5202631">Since 1967, HEW has provided that only income and resources that are in fact available to an applicant or a recipient for current use on a regular basis are to be taken into account in determining need and the amount of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.115" offset="5267832">And for example, HEW says that in a case where a child has a support obligation under a court order from the father that the state may not free as income, the amount which the court has ordered to pay, unless it's actually paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.940" offset="5335124">Now, the importance of that in this case is that the ground of California's position here and the District Courts decision below doesn't just knock out this HEW regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.115" offset="5375875">It would knock out every HEW regulation which announces the general or specific policies of non-assumption of income because what California says it has a right to do is to treat as an income to the AFDC family, any and every legal obligation created by state law without proof of actual receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.904" offset="5470960">Now, HEW has found over the course of many years of administering this program, if there's one thing that have a bird in a bush and I would have a bird in a hand as far as an AFDC family goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.650" offset="5514010">There are lots of legal obligations that just don't come off and don't come through, and it is the purpose of the HEW regulation to assure that except in a vividly class of cases where one can be very sure that legal obligations are in fact likely to come through, that states are not going to be permitted to assume income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.110" offset="5591855">Now, we think that the position of the court below in California is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.267" offset="5612440">Insofar as they purport absolutely to preclude HEW from limiting state power to treat non-received theoretically available resources as income to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.602" offset="5669804">Our position is that the statute precisely because it requires the HEW to approve state plans which are required to provide for a consideration of income and resources, plus HEW to decide what kind of income and resources are meant by that and if HEW reasonably sets restrictions on what the state can assume in the way of income, those restrictions are valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.099" offset="5759770">Here in light of the shortness of time, I mean to refer to only two of the restrictions and show how obviously consistent with statute they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.557" offset="5793625">HEW following King v. Smith required that, before income be assumed, state law imposed a legal obligation, and that the legal obligation being a general one, that is under a state statute of general applicability and the same as the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.872" offset="5858826">Some just start with the same as the fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.596" offset="5873768">Under California law as under MARS law, father's obligation is not defeasible if the father leaves the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.815" offset="5902608">He can be pursued and be required to support his child anytime, anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.227" offset="5924237">The obligation imposed by this particular California law exists so long and only so long as in the man is in the home, and that's true with regard to stepfather, MARS and everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.376" offset="5964884">As soon as he leaves the house, the right ceases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.599" offset="5977736">Now, of course HEW could require that California assure something like a parental obligation to support and not the half baked right that California has given children in the situations presented in this case because California -- HEW Cannon says must give them a full fledged right, one which is not useless simply because if a mother threatens to enforce it, the man leaves and there's an end of the right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.293" offset="6372498">If California is permitted to put in a regulation which says that “income is to be assumed because a man is required to support children only when he's in the home” the effect of that is to drive him out of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.700" offset="6418160">In two of these cases that's what exactly happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.912" offset="6427042">Now to prevent this result and to assure economic security, HEW, it is our position could properly promulgate this regulation it is valid and accordingly the state statute inconsistent with it is invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.103" offset="6615751">The essential questions presented to the court when prior to the enactment of the California statute are still here, those basic questions relate to the validity of the HEW regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.933" offset="6671130">We agree as well that the most appropriate course would be for the court as to the effect of the new California statute assuming the reversal of the decision below to remand it to the lower court for the proceedings to determine just what that particular statute means as to those situations affected by it.</text>
