            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="25.178" offset="204048">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.271" offset="228498">This too is a draft case raising two new unrelated and difficult problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.433" offset="273115">In a third aspect it's like the Welsh case which has just been argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.758" offset="298402">And for my argument on the question relating to religious training and belief, I rely on the argument in the case just concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.838" offset="354722">The defendant here was indicted for failing to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.823" offset="378650">There was a trial before jury at which the defendant testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.919" offset="407071">The jury returned a verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.146" offset="423999">The defendant then made a motion in arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.236" offset="444270">In his motion, the defendant said that he could not participate in the Vietnam War without doing violence to the dictates of his conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.894" offset="494947">And he further stated that, he cannot qualify as a conscientious objector within the meaning of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 because he is not a pacifist.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.119" offset="555865">And in any event, his convictions that the Vietnam War is illegal, immoral, and unjust are not based on religious training and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.031" offset="611453">The District Court granted the motion in arrest of judgment and so doing it referred to facts which had appeared at the trial and noted that particularly the defendants own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.228" offset="680312">And noted that “in substance the case arises upon an agreed statement of facts,” that appears on page 250 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.898" offset="726915">I can state that none of the facts is controvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.360" offset="748857">We do not dispute that the appellee was sincerely and conscientiously opposed to the Vietnam conflict based on his moral convictions, educational training, extensive reading both about Vietnam, and about such things as the UN Charter and the Nuremberg Trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.274" offset="844466">As I have indicated, his claim is selective not against war in any form as the phrase is in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.415" offset="885008">And he expressly asserts that it is not based on religious training and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.049" offset="915519">In this situation, the District Court held that the appellee had a valid claim to be constitutionally exempted from combat in the Vietnam type of situation.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="216.155" offset="967973">Do you think this is a motion in arrest of judgment or motion for an acquittal?</text>

            <text syncTime="223.988" offset="999320">This is a subject to which I am about to address my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.843" offset="1014784">It is the -- I was trying to give the setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.505" offset="1029413">The first half of my argument is devoted to jurisdiction and the second half to selective conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.923" offset="1063058">The Court concluded that the Military Service Act violated the free exercise in Due Process Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.360" offset="1092838">It held in the alternative of Section 6 (j) the exemption provision violated the Establishment Clause and that it unreasonably discriminated between religious and non-religious conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.053" offset="1151561">From this decision, the United States took this appeal purporting to act under the Second Clause of the Criminal Appeal Act of 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.253" offset="1196387">Now, found in Title 18 of the United States Code Section 3731, the relevant passages from which are set out on page 13 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.206" offset="1244244">And now, I will turn to the jurisdictional question which in my mind is a very close question.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.091" offset="1275695">We contend that there is jurisdiction but arguments can be made both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.898" offset="1306937">There's no doubt that there was a trial here and if there had been a verdict of not guilty even a directive verdict of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.328" offset="1348733">There could be no appeal no matter what error of law was made by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.147" offset="1376005">An illustration of that is found in the case decided just last month of United States against Bond which is set out in appendix to one of the briefs filed by amici curiae, the one by the Los Angeles selective service law panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.561" offset="1461582">In the Bond case, Judge Weigel directed the verdict for the defendant, who was a selective conscientious objector based on religious training and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.743" offset="1506304">We think that Judge Weigel was wrong as the matter of law but there's nothing we can do about it and we have of course taken no appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.195" offset="1548204">The difference is that here there was a verdict of guilty followed by a motion and arrest of judgment which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.579" offset="1585716">Now, if Judge Wyzanski had entered an order saying, having examined the record I find that there was no sufficient evidence to submit to the jury, and the case should not have been allowed to go to the jury and accordingly, I direct to the judgment of acquittal be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.191" offset="1656142">I think we would be so close to the situation in the Bond case that we couldn't talked about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.301" offset="1680593">And it is easy I think to say that, what Judge Wyzanski did is not different in substance from that and that summarizes the difficulty of our position on the jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.717" offset="6578239">In our view, the constitutional grant of power to Congress, to raise and maintain armies is not properly subject to the balancing approach applied in the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.907" offset="7314996">The former is usually a political objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.471" offset="7329207">While the latter we think may justly be regarded as a response of the individual to an inward matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.833" offset="7462745">And there are extensive arguments in the briefs of amici curiae to the effect that the First Amendment does command a general right of conscience.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.846" offset="8258748">Then it seems to me, that it would follow that a citizen could refuse to pay either any taxes or conceivably some kind of a pro rata allocation of his taxes, insofar as they or perhaps, we would have to set up separate funds and this taxes could go into a fund which couldn't be used for defense purposes and other people's taxes would go into the defense fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.328" offset="8360730">It seems to me that pressing the general language of the First Amendment that far would be pushing it to a dryly logical extreme.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.972" offset="9583261">The Bond case involved a sincere catholic who following certain teachings of the church with respect to just and unjust wars, concluded that this was unjust war and that he could not participate in it and I need not make it plain that I have no question whatever about the sincerity of his beliefs or about the sincerity of Sisson's beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.880" offset="9682944">It is our position that this is a judgment, which not only has been made by Congress, but which it was proper for Congress to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.345" offset="9720769">We have not only the First Amendment, we have the raise and maintain armies clause and Congress has said that two qualified for a conscientious objection, exemption you must be opposed to war in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.408" offset="9797047">And I would suppose that that would be true, even though Congress repealed the religious training and belief exception which it seems to me they might well do Australian-Great Britain get along without it but that's a matter for the judgment of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.617" offset="9873847">Supposed that Congress did eliminate religious training and belief but simply said as the Australians and the English do is opposed to war in any form.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.842" offset="9938735">I am only opposed to this war but I am opposed on religious grounds,” and brought in all kinds of documentation to show that he had sound religious grounds for doing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.420" offset="10861066">I have assumed for proposes of my brief an argument before this Court today, that the Government agreed with our position that what the judge in fact granted was a motion in arrest of judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2803.100" offset="11315806">The defendant with his counsel and Government counsel present, the Court reads its opinion granting defendants motion in arrest of judgment pursuing to Rule 34 by the federal rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.823" offset="11362617">Excerpts quoted below, “In the words of Rule 34 the indictment of Sisson does not charge an offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.133" offset="11387904">This Court's decision arresting a judgment of conviction for inefficiency of the indictment is based upon the invalidity of the statute upon which the indictment is founded within the meaning of those phrases as used in 18 U.S.C. Section 3731.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.116" offset="11443806">Then, the century in the docket continues and concludes Court orders this decision and this Court's order granting defendants Sisson's motion in arrest of judgment enter forthwith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.322" offset="11508694">On the question of the scope of the statute in conferring jurisdiction upon this Court on appeal, on direct appeal from judgments of the District Court, granting a motion in arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.570" offset="11573687">We concur with the position of the Government that indeed this Court does have jurisdiction under the motion in arrest of judgment provision of Section 3731 of the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.326" offset="11632724">In addition, it is our position that the Government saw an argument with respect to the other two clauses the plea in bar, as well as leave motion dismissing an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.983" offset="11707329">Really, really is quite persuasive that the intent of the draftsmen of the Criminal Appeals Act was precisely to confer upon this Court jurisdiction in all cases which were not precluded by the Constitution by reason of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.663" offset="11786010">Now, I have in mind for instance and I'm simply selecting randomly on page 22 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.453" offset="11837210">There is a quotation from Senator Bacon, which he indicates that, “The Jeopardy Clause was inserted in the motion in bar subdivision out of an abundance of caution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.302" offset="11896560">The caution, I suggest to the Court in context were simply that they wanted to be quite clear that they were not purporting to grand jurisdiction in cases which are constitutionally proscribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.651" offset="11953925">Now, as a reference to the purpose which the statute was intended to serve on that same page, page 22 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.882" offset="11982869">The purpose was simply to meet the problem of having District Court Judge's dismissing criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.343" offset="12024769">In particular there was a case against -- Cherry Meat Packers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.944" offset="12043160">The Court dismissed the proceedings and the Government was powerless to do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.688" offset="12062072">And Congress wanted to ensure that that sort of a result simply could not have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.930" offset="12087045">It wanted to provide review in this Court to ensure that those sorts of decisions would be reviewed by the Court and I don't think there's a shred of evidence which indicates that the Congress intended by providing various loopholes to make it possible by supposedly, well, a district judge bent on circumventing the appeals provision of the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.666" offset="12178056">To simply avoid this result namely of providing review in this Court by for instance permitting, well the procedure which was followed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.359" offset="12216822">That it seems to me that the present cases the prototype of the situation, which the draftsmen of the Criminal Appeals Act could not possibly have intended to result in precluding review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.920" offset="12263006">That is simply would be much too easy to circumvent the purpose of the draftsmen of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.040" offset="12283486">Now on page 23, Senator Nelson expressly says again I'm quoting the quotation, elsewhere said that, “The plain bar section, it was made clear out of the extreme caution that where the defendant has been put in jeopardy, he cannot be reindicted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.559" offset="12349628">The emphasis again was on the question whether the defendant having filed whatever motions been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.887" offset="12378885">Having that motion granted by the Court whether he could be reindicted and I don't think, there's any question or is there any suggestion by the Government that in circumstances where a defendant files a motion in bar or a motion in arrest of judgment that he could in fact be reindicted if the motion were granted in subsequently that decision were vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.107" offset="12467806">Now, the Government at page 25 quotes Justice Holmes in the case of United States against Macdonald and indeed, Justice Holmes refers to judgments rendered before the moment of jeopardy is reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.464" offset="12553279">What is omitted immediately succeeding the quotation that is the text includes a citation to the decision in Kepner against United States at 195 U.S. and in that decision Justice Holmes we quote from him in our brief, they declare that he consider the double jeopardy question to be a very limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.472" offset="12645230">That is he pointed out there are numerous circumstances in which a man can be retried after having once been tried and found guilty by a jury without contravening the double jeopardy safeguard in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.030" offset="12703535">It won't leave where the point anymore, I would like again to refer to the testimony of Senator Knox which is quoted at pages 26 and 27 of the Government's brief in which Senator Knox refers to all of the motions that is the merit to the indictment, the motion to quash or set aside the indictment, motion and arrest of judgment and in judgment sustaining defendant's plea in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.220" offset="12820250">And he refers to all of these motions, as motions the effect of which is to defeat jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.946" offset="12847208">I believe that's accurate in glossing of what is --</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.234" offset="13944351">We assert that that order was in it of itself invalid for variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.444" offset="13969115">I would in the time remaining this afternoon, simply like to address myself to two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.071" offset="13995656">One will be in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.829" offset="14006732">I'll refer to recent book written by a man named Raoul Berger entitled “Congress against the Supreme Court” in which the point is made I think quite convincingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.003" offset="14067336">The judicial review in this Court is not a matter of user patient by this Court but was something intended very definitely by the framers of the Constitution, precisely to provide a safeguard against the encroachment of individual liberty by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.228" offset="14156257">I would only like to refer to two quotations; one is from page 31 of this book its a 1969 book by Jefferson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.054" offset="14207561">Jefferson in 1781 stated, “That 173 despots would surely be as oppressive as one and elective despotism was not the Government we fought for.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.615" offset="14273808">Similarly, Madison in dealing with the purpose of the Bill of Rights stated, “These Amendments are incorporated into the Constitution, independent, tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.796" offset="14350608">It will be and impenetrable ball work against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.516" offset="14381432">Now, the notion that the Federal Congress might arrogate to itself, powers and infringing individual liberty was something of which the framers was -- were very, very conscious.</text>

            <text syncTime="3585.330" offset="14444648">They were concerned principally about Congress, the Federal Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.423" offset="14461053">They were not particularly concern about state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.278" offset="14476518">They have faith in their state legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.050" offset="14483623">They knew but they knew nothing whatsoever about this new organ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.100" offset="14503790">This Federal Legislature that was to sit at times 1,000 miles away from some parts of this vast land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.396" offset="14536913">And the people were afraid that precisely the Federal Government would reach out and deprive them of fundamental liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.166" offset="14564080">For this purpose, this Court was vested with judicial review with the power of deciding where the Congress has exceeded the limits of its power, of the limited delegated powers conferred by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.748" offset="14618415">This doctrine was asserted repeatedly throughout the time of the ratification of framing of the Constitution that is set on the verdict book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.495" offset="14653315">It was reiterated by this Court in Luther against Borden in the middle of 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.406" offset="14684975">The only other point, I wish to make is the repeated insistence by the Solicitor General to history that on the basis of the history surrounding the adoption of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.488" offset="14745370">There is no basis for this Court concluding that religion is coextensive with the rights of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.271" offset="14768462">I submit and I do it diffidently I was one of the students and this is a great man, vast knowledge of taxation certainly but I respectfully suggest that his knowledge -- the scope of the religion protection is not accurate, it's simply is not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.804" offset="14858637">I refer for instance to the part of our brief at pages 97 through 102.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.894" offset="14902941">In particular, I have reference to ratification statements, free ratification statements, that is before the Bill of Rights was in existence, that is I posit it to this Court the situation where there is no Bill of Rights where there is not First Amendment to be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.070" offset="14979636">And I ask this Court whether in that circumstance this Court could reach the conclusion that religion does not extend to the right of conscience or that the Constitution was intended to deprive individuals of the protection of religion, the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.029" offset="15055496">I refer in particular to declarations of rights made by the conventions of New York, Rhode Island, North Carolina, and Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.376" offset="15108890">These declarations assert the existence of certain inalienable rights and make it very clear that the Constitution was being ratified only with the expressed understanding that these rights were not infringed by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.723" offset="15170226">That was prior to the adoption of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.143" offset="15183914">One of these rights was, “That the people have an equal and natural and an alienable right freely and peaceably to exercise their religion according to the dictates of their conscience and that no religious sect or society ought to be favored or established by law in preference of others.”</text>
