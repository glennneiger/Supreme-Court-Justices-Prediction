            <text syncTime="41.694" offset="270190">Picketing takes place in front of a store to support a strike by that store's employees to obtain a satisfactory collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.619" offset="329853">The picketing is prohibited by a state injunction as a trespass because it takes place on a sidewalk which is publicly used, is privately owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.445" offset="389204">We have three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.721" offset="398294">First, does the prohibition violate the First Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="79.166" offset="420028">Second, is the controversy outside the jurisdiction of a state court because the subject matter is preempted by the National Labor Relations Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="91.376" offset="468825">Third, if the state court has subject matter jurisdiction, does the prohibition conflict with the federally protected right guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act to engage -- of a National Labor Relations Act, to engage in concerted activity for mutual aid or protection?</text>

            <text syncTime="325.145" offset="1403904">On January 22, 1965, an ex parte injunction was sought and obtained, restraining the picketing, enjoining the picketing in front of the store as a trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.756" offset="1466389">That ex parte injunction was continued on March 26, 1965 after a non-evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.644" offset="1497945">On April 9, an appeal was taken, in 1965 on November 10, the appeal was argued and submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.195" offset="1528142">On September 19, 1968, three-and-a-half years after the appeal was taken and three years after it was argued, the Alabama Supreme Court decided that the injunction should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.573" offset="1585716">It said that the controversy was not preempted to the Labor Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.492" offset="2885360">The essence of Logan Valley as we see it is that when an employer opens his property to the public, to customers in order to come to this store to buy, to others in the community in order to operate his store that employer cannot close that property to employees and seek to publicize the store's disfavored labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.336" offset="2980760">The only difference between Logan Valley and this case is that the real estate here is smaller than it was in Logan Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.936" offset="3015137">In Logan Valley, the distances from the public entrances to the picketed area were from 350 feet to 400 and 500 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.831" offset="3058709">In this case, the distances are 115 feet to 385 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.049" offset="3083577">In a case decided by the Supreme Court of California in which following Logan Valley, the Court said -- the California Supreme Court said with respect to a single shop owner that Logan Valley requires that picketing -- that handbilling be permitted on the private sidewalk serving that individual store owner because the sidewalk was publicly used.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.071" offset="3171662">The distances were 150 feet to 280 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.816" offset="3190680">We do not think that the appropriateness of the property as a place for the expression of First Amendment rights with respect to a dispute which relates to the operation on that property can be sized by whether it's 350 feet, 400, 500 feet, 150 feet, 280 feet or whatever the distances may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.648" offset="3269987">To us, it seems that the only viable standard can be the openness of a property to a public entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.746" offset="3294333">Once it's open, it does not matter whether the distances which are open are 115 feet or 400 to 500 feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.209" offset="4068185">It's the openness of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.778" offset="4074454">The very fact as the federation in its amicus brief put it with respect to the character of all stores which have private property on which they front but that private property is intended for use to enable the customer to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.560" offset="4157628">It put it this way in its amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.939" offset="4167137">Smaller, such retail establishments have in common with large shopping centers, a desire to maximize the accessibility of the public to their premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.560" offset="4205589">It is an integral component of every retail business that it be freely open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.589" offset="4229726">And therefore, our position that whether the open property happens to be smaller or larger cannot by the criterion so long as it's open, then it has to be open to employees to publicize that this labor policy of a particular employer operating within that real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.689" offset="4298167">Now, in this case, I think this is particularly plain because here, we have employees of that very store who want to picket or handbill and are barred from those very premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.120" offset="4351875">Now, when they're working for that store, they are parking their car on that parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.888" offset="4370892">They're using those walkways and they're entering the same entrance in order to get to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.316" offset="4400671">Now, it doesn't seem to us that those employees when they are dissatisfied with the employment terms become trespassers instead of invitees when they park their car on that same parking lot, walk those same walkways, but this time picket in front of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.177" offset="4468067">You don't become an -- or trespasser rather than an invitee when you change from a working employee to a striking employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.952" offset="4511222">Now, we're told by the Alabama Supreme Court that picketing is more than speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.173" offset="4532015">Sure, it's more than speech, but it was more than speech in Logan Valley as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.753" offset="4550405">And more than speech means only that the patrol in front of the store may be regulated with respect to the number of pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.470" offset="4581230">If there are too many there or if they are too close to the doorway and interfere with ingress and egress, then you tell them to get away from the doorway and picket on the far side of the sidewalk, that's what we mean by regulation of the plus aspect of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.974" offset="4639222">We do not mean that you can ban it all together from an otherwise appropriate open place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.867" offset="4662836">It's suggested in this case that there was actually obstructed picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.983" offset="4679346">We'll pass the question whether on this record, it is possible for anyone to say there was obstructed picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.829" offset="4706722">There was six identically worded affidavits which said there was obstructed picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.916" offset="4726993">There was an answer filed by the union which said there was no obstructed picketing sworn to by two officers of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.691" offset="4758131">I do not know how as between six paper swearers on the one side and two paper swearers on the other one can ever find a fact one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.348" offset="4792717">You need an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.667" offset="4802017">But suppose, suppose there was obstructive picketing in this case, all that that would authorize would be the elimination of the obstruction and not the elimination of picketing and that's the point of this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.398" offset="4856978">The Court says the Alabama Supreme Court, it doesn't look to us as if the picketing at the entrance to the parking lot would a materially less effective than the picketing in front of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.078" offset="4903685">Our fundamental answer is that's the wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.364" offset="4916851">If a place is otherwise appropriate for the exercise of free speech rights, that place does not become inappropriate because there are other places as well that one can exercise free speech rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.686" offset="4974111">But if one is to look to comparative effectiveness, it's perfectly clear that the picketing and handbilling cannot possibly be nearly as effective at the entrance to the parking lot as it is in front of a store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.880" offset="5030849">First of all, with respect to handbilling; I don't care how slowly a car moves from a public street through an entrance into a parking lot, it's still moving and you cannot very well distribute handbills to a moving vehicle and you sure can't distribute handbills to a moving vehicle on a cold day when those windows are uptight and no one is lowering windows to receive handbills on a cold day and once those people are in the parking lot, you can't get to them to distribute handbills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.966" offset="5155192">So handbill distribution is very much enfeebled by this kind of an injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.349" offset="12688802">Once that conclusion is reached and properly so if that a conclusion is properly so, it is the traditional right of the state courts to provide a remedy for that wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.387" offset="12756929">The cause of action for remedying an unlawful trespassers are amongst the oldest in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.977" offset="12795277">The state of Alabama below followed the test annunciated by this Court for the determination as to whether petitioners were validly exercising First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.833" offset="12846686">They found that it would not interfere with the First Amendment rights of the petitioners to move them away 100 feet, and that it would seriously impair the operation of respondent to allow them on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.795" offset="12902588">This is the balancing test earlier described.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.958" offset="12915231">They followed the law in that respect, and then they found that there was a trespasser, an unlawful interfering trespasser on the property.</text>
