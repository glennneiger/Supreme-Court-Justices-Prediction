            <text syncTime="17.094" offset="171760">Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.277" offset="184508">In view of the few minutes remaining to me, I'd like to turn first to the substance of the position of the Government which in essence says that the court below improperly determined that that the HEW regulation in question here conflicted with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.429" offset="265070">If time permits, I should like then to have an opportunity to respond further to the jurisdictional point that Mr. Justice Stewart raised yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.092" offset="311777">The statute that is in question here is Section 402 (a) 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.648" offset="338004">It's reprinted in the Government's -- the appendix to the Government's brief in pertinent part, it provides that a state plan for aid and services to needy families with children must provide that the state agency shall in determining need take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid to families with dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.802" offset="434552">The HEW regulation construes that critical language any other income and resources as meaning actual income, actual contributions made by stepfather or a MARS.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.086" offset="495679">California's approach is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.312" offset="508635">They assumed that where there is a stepfather or a MARS that his income is attributable and is a resource of the child without any actual proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.393" offset="556910">That's the essence of the controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.620" offset="569866">Now, California agrees and the court below agreed that if HEW's regulation is valid, as a proper implementation of the act, that California's conflicting statute must necessarily fall in the sense that California can no longer continue to be entitled to receive benefits should the secretary determine to cut them off.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.650" offset="3625984">We think that the regulation is valid for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.501" offset="3641344">First, we think that the presumption of validity always attaches and as this Court has said a number of times to the administrative interpretation by a Government official charged with the responsibility for administering a particular act.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.356" offset="3700799">As Mr. Amsterdam indicated yesterday, the same approach, the approach of requiring proof of actual income before reduction of benefits has been applied across the board in other categorical public assistance programs by HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.915" offset="3759000">Moreover, we think that in 1967 Congress at least implicitly approved the HEW regulation when it reenacted the Act and in an act of certain amendments to these provisions knowing what HEW's construction had been and not seeking to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.920" offset="3835068">Moreover, we think that it's quite clear in King versus Smith, the Court specifically referred to predecessor regulation and said regulations of HEW, this is in footnote 16 of King versus Smith, regulations of HEW which clearly comport with the statute, restrict the resources which are to be taken into account under Section 602 to those that, "are in fact available to an applicant or recipient for current use on a regular basis."</text>
            <text syncTime="963.275" offset="3956485">This regulation properly excludes from consideration resources which are merely assumed to be available to the needy individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.394" offset="3988982">Moreover, the Court earlier this term summarily affirmed the decision by the Court -- the District Court in Connecticut in Salman versus Shapiro which is reported at 396 US file which held the HEW regulation valid and an inconsistent Connecticut practice to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.434" offset="4073096">Moreover, we think that the HEW's approach is consistent with the purpose of the act which is to provide economic security to the five million plus children that are covered by this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.100" offset="4119803">It's a massive act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.054" offset="4123564">This regulation is an important part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.547" offset="4141537">The -- the whole program involves expenditure of over $2 billion by the Federal Government each year, a total expenditure close to $4 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.871" offset="4190856">California statute we think conflicts with this regulation and since California has a statute that I already have referred to which says that when it's rules and regulations conflict the federal rules shall prevail, we think whatever the relevance of this supremacy clause that in this context the District Court improperly struck down the HEW regulation and improperly upheld the California approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.503" offset="4285419">California's approach of assuming support simply is contrary to fact in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.595" offset="4309765">Moreover, it is inconsistent with King versus Smith for the reasons that I've indicated earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.415" offset="4328991">There's some language in that opinion that counsel might prefer to but that language is always accompanied by the reference to support in fact and while the Court referred to a legal obligation, it also referred to support in fact as coupled therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.700" offset="4390222">The Court was referring King versus Smith, we think to a legal obligation of general applicability not the strange sort of thing that California sought to carve out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.635" offset="4429928">Indeed, if California is right, Alabama could have avoided the decision there by just enacting a statute which said “Okay, substitute fathers have a legal obligation of support whether it was enforceable or not what difference it would have complied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.001" offset="4487398">Now, we don't think the Court intend to that King versus Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.963" offset="4499205">We don't think that makes good sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.094" offset="5999783">But to the extent that there is a notion of having stable family units, it seems to me that HEW's approach and not California fosters that because HEW's approach allows the reduction in the amount of benefit payments only when there is proof of actual income and therefore, when there is not actual income the MARS or the stepfather I assume will continue to reside with the children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.616" offset="6353795">Frankly, they speak in terms of the obligation of support not being a general one that applies across the board but one tailored to AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.033" offset="6387545">Well, that's quite right it is one tailored to AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.775" offset="6398516">There was a case where one of these people said that this law was a deprivation of his right of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.029" offset="6451493">He simply -- his income is simply being assumed to have been transferred to the support of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.667" offset="6478033">So, to the extent that this California authority, it's confusing and ambiguous but it at least raises questions as to whether the duty of support is anything more than a loser one.</text>
