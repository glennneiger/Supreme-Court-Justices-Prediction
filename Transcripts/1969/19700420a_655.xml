            <label>Mr. Robert Allen Sedler</label>
            <text syncTime="14.938" offset="163088">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.346" offset="168730">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="18.561" offset="177612">The issues in this case, arise out of the stated refusal of petitioner Mulloys Selective Service Board to reopen his classification and consider his claim for conscientious objector status.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.965" offset="243231">That's what we are dealing with here, a failure to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.873" offset="258905">We do not have the case where the board has decided to claim, at least officially, on the merits and where there has been an appeal, or at least, an opportunity for an appeal, so that the question before this Court would be whether there was a basis in fact for the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.259" offset="332361">The issue is not whether the petitioner was a conscientious objector or whether there was a basis in fact for a substantive determination that he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.922" offset="375097">The issue is purely a procedural one.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.211" offset="388263">Did the petitioner make enough of a showing of entitlement to classification as a conscientious objector that he was entitled to an appealable determination by the board?</text>
            <text syncTime="84.778" offset="442493">I guess what this case is all about is that the petitioner claims, he was entitled to a full-scale determination including the right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.855" offset="482826">The board summarily dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.290" offset="496515">The first issue then revolves around the summary dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.899" offset="515009">The petitioner is contended throughout these proceedings that the board either was required to reopen because based on his SSS Form 150 and the letters and other information submitted in support of a claim, he made out a prima facie case of entitlement or, that what really happened was that the board in fact reopened deciding the claim against him on the merits but denying him the appeal to which he was entitled by the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.363" offset="636844">In this Court, the Government now concedes which is a clear departure from its position here before that based on the SSS Form 150 and the supporting letters, the petitioner made out a prima facie case of entitlement but says the Government, even so, the board does not have to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.094" offset="715734">I think issue was joined on that first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.864" offset="726810">The second issue --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="156.710" offset="730258">Do you think it can be -- this record -- what reading for the board's action?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Allen Sedler</label>
            <text syncTime="164.369" offset="760874">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.279" offset="764531">This is a point that we have made and that the board did not say why it found that he wasn't a conscientious objector.B</text>
            <text syncTime="175.450" offset="805177">ut the record does clearly say what the board did.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.682" offset="822105">The Form 100, the phase form, falling the November 9th meeting, says, “Classification not reopened”.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.747" offset="866408">Now, following the meeting on January 11th, the SSS Form 100 reads all information in the file considered including claim of conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.542" offset="921579">The board felt that information did not warrant reopening of 1-A classification vote four to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.385" offset="952926">This was also brought out at the testimony both in the civil trial and the criminal trial where Chairman Sherman stated, “That taking everything in the file.”</text>
            <text syncTime="224.266" offset="1000469">Assuming what he said to be true, he did not make out a case and we saw no reason to reopen because it wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.898" offset="1030980">I think it is very clear that the board's reason for its action was that the petitioner did not make out a prima facie case for entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.210" offset="1068178">This was the Government's argument both in the District Court and before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.017" offset="1091480">The Court of Appeals explicitly stated that, petitioner did not make out a prima facie case and therefore the board was not required to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.119" offset="1131813">Now, we have contended all along, that the only way you could say, he did not make out a prima facie case is to totally distort the meaning of prima facie case, and say that prima facie case means the same thing as a merits determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.498" offset="1189386">I think that's the point that stands out most clearly in this case, that there was nothing more that the board could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.443" offset="1221151">No further information that it could've considered if it had in fact reopened the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.920" offset="1247065">Now, what it did was to say, “We don't think he is a conscientious objector.”</text>
            <text syncTime="291.476" offset="1269321">Now, the board can say that but under the regulations, this constitutes a reopening in fact, entitling the registrant to an administrative appeal under Section 1625.13.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.018" offset="1323447">The second issue and this isn't a way related to the first, is simply that he was denied due process because the board did not give them a full and fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.756" offset="1366392">They didn’t read the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.795" offset="1378513">They, at best, walked through it, scanning it before making a determination that he didn’t state a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.543" offset="1413517">They're simply would not have been timed at the so-called courtesy hearing for the three members who were present to even scan, let alone read the detailed answers to SSS Form 150, let alone all the other information in the form.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.241" offset="1476315">Does that necessarily or possibly rest on an assumption that they haven't read it a little bit sooner?</text>

            <text syncTime="352.494" offset="1513305">They so stated at the trial, there were three -- there were three members present, Your Honor at the November 9th hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.099" offset="1547786">Mr. Sherman, the Chairman testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.650" offset="1557922">Well, we looked over his file before he came in as we would anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.739" offset="1578297">Now, at that time, in the record and the civil trial will bare this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.331" offset="1592717">There were other registrants ahead of Mulloy.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.847" offset="1602748">Then Mulloy came in to the interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.124" offset="1611839">Mr. Downs said that, “The file was there and any member who wanted to could look at it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="383.228" offset="1636289">I asked Mr. Downs, “Did you read it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="385.391" offset="1644962">He said, “No, I just scanned it because I was the newest member of the board and I wasn't familiar with what was in the file at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="393.750" offset="1678399">Mr. Wolfgang said that, “He read it but he couldn't recall how much time he spent on it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="399.697" offset="1702118">I think it's very clear from the evidence that these members didn't read the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.163" offset="1724061">We've also contended as part of the same denial of the full and fair hearing that the demonstrable incompetence of the draft board members was a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.794" offset="1774529">They simply did not understand what a conscientious objector was.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.871" offset="1794905">The clerk testified that in her 17 years with the board, no one had ever been assigned to civilian work as a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.259" offset="1832417">Mr. Sherman, the chairman of the board thought that a conscientious objector was one who was opposed to the use of violence which of course is not the statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.202" offset="1872227">Mr. Downs didn't seem to realize that the board had the power to determine whether a man was a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.202" offset="1908172">Mr. Walking seem to think that by applying for conscientious objector status, the member stay -- the registrant stated that he would not do alternative civilian service.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.630" offset="1953938">Now, I think this is the factual situation that we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.989" offset="1971284">The Government says that the board must have assumed that the petitioner was not sincere.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.383" offset="1996884">Otherwise, it would have been inexplicable that they didn't reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.216" offset="2012244">I would suggest that there may be another reason that they never read the file and if they had read the file, it wouldn't have made any difference because they had no understanding of what a conscientious objector was.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.292" offset="2060518">The relevant time period is a fairly brief one.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.560" offset="2077654">All the relevant events relating to conscientious objector status occurred between May 1967 and January 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.804" offset="2118614">The petitioner after leaving school in 1966 went to work for the Appalachia volunteers, an anti-poverty group working in Eastern Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.863" offset="2162813">He was given an occupational deferment to weigh from March 1966 to May 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.909" offset="2194996">In May 1967, he was classified as I-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.666" offset="2214013">This was affirmed by the Appeals Board in August of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.650" offset="2237942">I believe the date was August 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.050" offset="2251525">On August 11, 1967, petitioners -- petitioner and two other people were arrested in Eastern Kentucky on a charge of teaching sedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.411" offset="2293008">All of these is brought out in McSurely versus Ratliff we've cited in the brief were a three judge federal court found that the prosecution was undertaken to inhibit organizing activities in Eastern Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.742" offset="2346297">They enjoined the prosecution because a statute was patently unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.377" offset="2364897">The petitioner spent some time in jail before he was released on bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.284" offset="2384541">There was a midnight raiding party, 15 armed men led by the prosecuting attorney came to the petitioners house ransacked through all the books and records and this was the sedition prosecution to which the petitioner was subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.444" offset="2449115">The three judge federal court enjoined the prosecution on September 14th, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.256" offset="2476387">It then directed the petitioner and the other plaintiffs to execute a $500.00 recognizance bond to the federal court pending the right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.761" offset="2522467">The states right of appeal expired 60 days later and no appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.406" offset="2549008">Now, the petitioner stated in his letter to the board of October 17th that, his experiences in Eastern Kentucky, including the sedition prosecution were the precipitating catalysts.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.087" offset="2611702">This caused generalized belief in pacifism and nonviolence and he demonstrated his belief in nonviolence by supporting letters to crystallize into in his view, objection to participation in war, wrestled with his conscience and came to the conclusions saying, “I can now say, I am a conscientious objector.”</text>
            <text syncTime="649.584" offset="2701667">He wrote this to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.848" offset="2706787">He filled out the SSS Form 150 in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.926" offset="2727058">Included in the letters were -- including the supporting information were letters from a Catholic priest testifying his sincerity, testifying as to why opposition to war was consistent with Catholic teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.576" offset="2781706">There were further letters in there testifying as to his activities in Eastern Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.443" offset="2809187">The board members granted this courtesy hearing, as I called it, on November 9th, right after the board, the interview which lasted about 10 or 15 minutes and here, I really like to quote from the Government's brief that they meaning the board members, discussed the case briefly and came to unanimous conclusion that there was no basis or justification for reopening the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.400" offset="2912946">The effective decision was made on November 9th but an entry to this effect was made on Form 100, classification not reopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.319" offset="2948681">Now, the reason the board didn't take a vote that evening, was that petitioner was still under bond to the federal court and was believed under indictment in Kentucky on a charge of flourishing a deadly weapon which was later dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.739" offset="3014301">They took the formal meeting, the formal vote at a meeting of January 11th and according to Chairman Sherman at that time, it readopted or reaffirmed its action of November 9th, and it's that point where we held the entry in the phase Form 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.106" offset="3083786">All information in the file was considered including claim of conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.358" offset="3104789">All members present felt this information did not warrant a reopening of I-A classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.575" offset="3169677">He had an occupational deferment until May of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.749" offset="3194337">This then was not renewed and this was denied in August of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.067" offset="3219623">He didn't file for conscientious objector until October 67 following the sedition prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.822" offset="3250657">But, he made it very clear that he considered his work in Appalachia to be the clearest demonstration of his religious beliefs, of his sincerity and his opposition to war.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.149" offset="3307917">I think it's also fair to say that he believed that if he were granted conscientious objector status, he might be permitted to continue to do anti-poverty work which would presumably qualify as alternative service in the national interest under Section 1660.1 of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.341" offset="3400704">If the members of the board had read his SSS Form 150, they would have understood the correlation between his work in Appalachia and his claim of conscientious objector status.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.131" offset="3451904">I think it's the height of sophistry to say that a young man, not learned in the law, who by law can't be represented by counsel before these draft boards can suddenly have his claim for conscientious objector status converted into a claim for occupational deferment which had previously been denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="963.520" offset="3957426">I focused on this particular event, namely the sedition prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.573" offset="3981667">Its when does a man really have to face up to the question, “Am I a conscientious objector?”</text>

            <text syncTime="993.611" offset="4077798">Moreover, there's another point that Id like to make that the board never -- never considered this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.258" offset="4108413">Mr. Sherman, the Chairman of the Board was specifically asked, “Did you ask him, excuse me, any questions as to why you did not file for the claim of conscientious objector earlier?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.884" offset="4690944">The Sixth Circuit is the only Circuit that upholds that the board is not required to reopen whenever a prima facie case for classification has been presented and they held this in the case of the most difficult claim one of conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.279" offset="4756459">What they have done has been to completely obliterate Mulloy between a refusal to reopen and denial of claim under merits following a reopening that what were they were saying is that the board can decide if it wants to reopen or if it doesn't want to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.672" offset="4830020">Now, this is totally contrary to the clear import of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.819" offset="4850604">There are two reasons I think why a board has to reopen upon the presentment of a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.436" offset="4877145">The first goes to procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.722" offset="4890311">Upon a reopening, the registrant gets a personal appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.932" offset="4907133">That's mandatory under Section 625 -- 1625.11 and 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.617" offset="4929808">It's only by a personal appearance that he will get a chance to tell his side of the story, otherwise, the board can't simply decide without having heard him present his story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.120" offset="4983829">The second reason relates to an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.294" offset="4996577">Under the regulations whenever the draft board decides the merits, that determination is to be reviewed by an appeals board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.708" offset="5030222">If the draft board can decide the merits unilaterally then you completely negate the provisions of 1625.13 providing for an appeal after reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.630" offset="5081840">Now, where the board is not supposed to reopen under 1625.4 is where the new facts even if true would not entitle the registrant to the claim classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.038" offset="6267486">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.585" offset="6281697">Since Mr. Sedler has taxed the Government for changing its position during this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.762" offset="6306461">It seems appropriate for me to restate the Government's position at the outset of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.438" offset="6329135">I think I can do so in two propositions which I will briefly describe and then return to each in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.154" offset="6364035">The first proposition relates to what we believe to be the basic issue of law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.206" offset="6388172">That is, what inquiries can a local board make and what issues can it resolved concerning a request for reclassification without the board being deemed to have, in fact, reopen the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.040" offset="6451493">Section 1625.4 of the regulations clearly specifies two issues which are for the primary determination by the board in deciding whether to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.191" offset="6504155">The first is whether the facts alleged by the registrant, if true, would justify a change in the registrant's classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.968" offset="6547205">The second issue is whether the facts presented are new facts which were not considered by the board at the time the registrant was classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.951" offset="6587225">The discretionary language of 1625.2 also demonstrates that there are other issues which may be resolved by the board without a reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.219" offset="6636231">Thus, we believe that the board may in certain circumstances decide the critical facts are not true and therefore, the reclassification would not be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.876" offset="6678862">The board also may reach certain conclusions about the facts alleged and deny reopening on that basis, thus, in certainly -- certain narrowly defined classes of cases which I will illustrate presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.415" offset="6737063">The board may conclude that the registrant's civilian work is not in the national interest or that its claim of conscientious objection is not a sincerely held belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.934" offset="6783143">Interpreted in this manner, we believe that the regulation affords a necessary flexibility to the Selective Service System to dispose off meritless applications without full administrative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.447" offset="6845210">This is necessary as we show in our brief in order to prevent the administrative system from becoming bogged down with such applications and to prevent disingenuous registrants from postponing and perhaps avoiding military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.772" offset="6918457">Our second proposition relates to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.229" offset="6936325">We submit that what the local board did in this case was to conclude that petitioner had not set forth facts which would justify conscientious objector classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.262" offset="6984391">Because the true premise for his claim was his belief in the importance of his work in Appalachia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.641" offset="7017932">This is the determination which the board has clearly authorized to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.214" offset="7036217">And as I hope to demonstrate later in this argument, the board had a rational basis when the facts of this case for making that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.177" offset="7076028">And Mr. Sedler has stated that the Government has conceded that there was a prima facie basis -- prima facie case for reclassification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.271" offset="7116466">The Government has made this concession and I should clarify our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.219" offset="7136214">We believe that certain of the facts set forth in petitioners Form 150 and in the accompanying letters, taken together with all doubts resolved in favor of the petitioner and with all inconsistent information disregarded would have constituted a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.607" offset="7213850">But the question for the local board was whether it should try to piece together the favorable information, resolve doubts in favor of the petitioner, and disregard his own statements that seemed inconsistent with his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.637" offset="7273932">That was the question which the board resolved after its courtesy interview with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.454" offset="7297233">It decided that there was no reason to reopen because the facts as explained by the petitioner did not justify reclassification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.083" offset="7347702">Now as to the point of law involved in this case, I would like to give three illustrations of what I think would be the Government's position as to what inquiries the board can make without reopening and what issues it can resolve without reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.509" offset="7417396">I think the first illustration was elicited in Mr. Sedlers colloquy with Mr. Justice Stewart concerning the question, whether the registrant is a student at X College, whether he is a United States Senator or perhaps whether his wife is pregnant as he alleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.086" offset="7491688">We believe that the discretion granted to the board in Section 1625.2 allows the board to inquire into that critical fact, if true and if the fact is found not true, then to deny a reopening on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.669" offset="7574026">The second illustration that I would give is a situation where a registrant claims that he is employed in the national interest and let's suppose that he says that he is employed in an electronics factory making radar scopes for jet fighter planes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.378" offset="7644871">Now in that case, we do believe that the board, if there's no reason to doubt the truth of the facts, would be required to reopening consider that claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.041" offset="7691577">The situation might be different if there were another case in which the registrant alleged that he was employed in such and such a factory and the board had very recently decided in the case on the merits that someone doing exactly what this registrant was doing was not in the national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.794" offset="7770572">Perhaps in that case, the board would be justified in claiming to reopen without full consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.262" offset="7796381">The third example would, in this area would almost be humorous but in the situation which is very clear that the occupation is not deferrable and said that he was a good humorous salesman or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.596" offset="7849775">We think that the board could deny a reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.239" offset="7872345">Now, the third example is the situation of the conscientious objector and as the cases illustrate, there are two issues for the board to resolve on the merits in that case, first is, what is the character of the registrants belief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.226" offset="7936293">That is what does -- what does he really – I will put this way, what does he say that he believes concerning his moral objection to participation in war?</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.141" offset="7991986">What is the nature of that belief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.068" offset="8003688">The second issue is the sincerity of this belief that is -- does he really, genuinely believe what he says he believes about participation in war or is this a claim of convenience?</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.406" offset="8133047">It's illustrated its position in somewhat of a different context in the Gearey line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.802" offset="8166588">But of course, those cases did involve a claim of conscientious objection made after an induction notice has been sent but very similar issues are presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.874" offset="8222908">We would submit that in most instances, that second issue for the board to resolve that I said, whether this man really believes what he says he believes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.608" offset="8273795">“What's in his mind?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.745" offset="8282363">Is a question that could not be resolved by the board without a reopening which would give the registrant an opportunity -- a formal opportunity for appearance before the board and appeal to the State Appeals Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.518" offset="8345475">We would say however, that there might certain cases in which even that claim, that issue can be resolved by the board without a reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.331" offset="8380688">If the registrant claims that his conscientious objection to military service is based for example upon study in a monastery or in a divinity school or a strong association with the peace church or a peace group and the board finds by reliable means that those allegations are untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.766" offset="8474415">It might make the decision without reopening that this registrant is insincere in his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.608" offset="8501791">I think that's a justifiable decision in this case and in all these other lines of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.986" offset="8523316">If there's any prejudice that would result to the registrant in that case, in any of those cases from the board's erroneous view, the registrant could learn what the reason could a local board's decision was and if it secured erroneous information, he could correct the record and the case would proceed from that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.183" offset="10848110">I think that the record as a whole shows that these – that even though there might have been a disposition against reopening by those members who were present at the November 9th meeting that that disposition did not ripen into a decision until January 11th, until they had all read the file, until they had given it mature consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.063" offset="11555610">He starts out, this on page 58, 59 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.156" offset="11572015">He starts out by saying, “I've been thinking about the short interview I had with you all last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.925" offset="11599078">It doesn't seem to me that all the points were covered that should've been and that I was not able to fully express my position of conscience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.849" offset="11634813">That's a way he starts out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.015" offset="11639411">He has some reservations that he didn't get across to the board when he really wanted to get across to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.023" offset="11659473">But what is he going on to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.968" offset="11667205">He starts out by saying, “These are certainly trouble times in this country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.163" offset="11684028">Then he talks about discrimination and poverty, the coming revolution, “Another revolution is beginning to take place in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.710" offset="11726242">I, of course, hope that this revolution takes a non-violent form but I remind you that I'm an organizer, that I've dedicated my life to change into the constant struggle that is democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.304" offset="11776606">There is nothing that can stop me from organizing against something that I don't believe.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.431" offset="11797086">And then down the paragraph on page 59, “I told you that I felt I was serving my country's needs here in Pike County.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.888" offset="11830941">That was no frivolous statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.728" offset="11838255">The problems are too great to be ignored any longer and no one should be sent to another country as long as we are in the mess we're in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.932" offset="11875140">So, that's what he really wanted to get across to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.501" offset="11885380">This is a letter written some three days after his interview.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.240" offset="12156322">We believe that the question before the board is that the question of the board phrased for itself was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.065" offset="12183594">This is a very sincere young man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.806" offset="12194565">But is he a very sincere or what?</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.519" offset="12205432">And the way that the board resolved that was that he's a very sincere Appalachia volunteer who believed that it was essential for him and it's a matter of conscience for him to remain in his present work organizing the poor in Appalachia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.183" offset="12272097">So, the board -- the board did not in any way suggested that petitioner was being mendacious or less than candid with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.780" offset="12318490">I think that it decided that what the petitioner wanted was a continuation of his classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.090" offset="12347747">Now, to go on -- I'm just going to take some highlights from the petitioner's Selective Service conscientious objector form which is Form 150 in this printed page -- beginning at page 15 of the appendix and to go on to page, over to page 16, there is a series of questions which the petitioner answered at length in an appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.353" offset="12476792">He didn't use the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.809" offset="12486614">But question number three was, “Explain how, when, and from whom or from what source you received the training and acquired the belief which is the basis of your claim made in series one.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.741" offset="12546382">The claim made in series one that he's conscientiously opposed to military service in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.247" offset="12572400">And he began his long answer to that question on page 19 of the appendix, it goes on to say that -- it starts by saying, he was born to catholic parents and inspired by missionary orders and had apparently catholic school training up to high school then become deeply troubled and faced a religious crisis and incidentally attempted suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.622" offset="12701863">Then after that, he says, he began to get back on the right track and came under the influence of Thomas Merton who was then residing in a monastery in Kentucky.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_allen_sedler" startTime="3524.267" stopTime="3862.993">
            <label>Mr. Robert Allen Sedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3524.267" offset="14200456">You're Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.666" offset="14210069">To get back to the first point that I made, the issue before this Court is not whether petitioner Mulloy is a conscientious objector or whether there is a basis in fact for a board's merit decision followed by an appeal that a man was not a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.472" offset="14301288">The issue before the Court is was the board required to reopen and give the man an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.565" offset="14329605">That's all we were asking in this case, is to have an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.472" offset="14349249">The Government has gone through the file pointing out that the board could've found this and the board could've found that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.465" offset="14385194">For purposes of argument, let's assume that the board could've done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.673" offset="14402017">Under the regulations, this decision is also to be made by an appeals board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.511" offset="14433468">In this case, it is the petitioner who was arguing for adherence to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.568" offset="14457605">And it's the Government that is arguing for a broad interpretation of the regulations for which it confined no support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.592" offset="14489788">The clear scheme of the regulations is that merits determinations are to be reviewed where a man makes out a prima facie case or a new classification -- (Inaudible) a claim that had never been made before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.326" offset="14556662">When a man makes out a prima facie case for a new classification, assuming that there is an issue of material fact, and certainly the Government's argument makes it clear that there was such an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.860" offset="14610787">Then the procedure provided in the regulations is for the board to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.991" offset="14635342">Make a decision, then give the man a personal appearance, so that he can fully tell his side of the story, present his version, try to correct the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.217" offset="14680273">Then, if the board still keeps him in that classification, the case is reviewed de novo by the appeals board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.588" offset="14709739">So, that's all we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.118" offset="14719875">Should there have been an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.526" offset="14733458">The consequences that the Government talks about are imaginary and all of the other circuits; the boards have been required to reopen whenever a prima facie case has been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.393" offset="14780897">The draft hasn't stopped functioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.772" offset="14790510">All that it is meant is that people will get a fair chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.935" offset="14807124">The present petitioner is under a sentence of five years imprisonment and a fine of $10,000.00 following a determination that is basically made for 10 minutes and I repeat Your Honors, they never read the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.303" offset="14880580">It seems to me and maybe I have an advantage here over the Government's counsel because I've tried the case from the beginning that we're in never, never land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.774" offset="14914435">The Government has attributed these highly sophisticated mental processes to the board but the board never read the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.533" offset="14953514">They never carefully went through the SSS Form 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.085" offset="14967724">It may well have been that on the basis of what they heard at the interview, they thought he was asking for an occupational deferment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.589" offset="15001684">They couldn't have reached that conclusion, if they would've read his SSS Form 150 and they would've seen as Your Honors pointed out from the bench, the correlation between his views.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.114" offset="15051839">Now, we're talking about a young man, this time 23 years old who wasn't represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.181" offset="15076080">Maybe if lawyers were allowed to appear before draft boards, we could clear some of these things up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.155" offset="15103979">If the board members had these doubts, why didn't the board member asked him?</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.659" offset="15133968">Now, Mr. Mulloy, let's be clear, what are you claiming?</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.402" offset="15149014">Are you claiming classification as a conscientious objector or do you want an occupational deferment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.342" offset="15176704">Nobody asked him that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.997" offset="15183391">Nobody asked any questions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.687" offset="15194154">He was entitled to assume that they read the record, which they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.223" offset="15216306">We're told that we're supposed to presume that these proceedings are fair and regular.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.728" offset="15234278">I would submit with all due deference, you can't presume that on the record that we have here because the board members simply did not read the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.137" offset="15287881">Now, we're talking about the most difficult classification here that of conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.598" offset="15321736">The board members throughout assumed the sincerity of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.071" offset="15347649">They assumed that he was sincere in his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.846" offset="15358725">Those beliefs are essentially religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.786" offset="15374503">This is clear from a reading of the Form 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.515" offset="15389445">It's clear from the letter from the Catholic priest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.039" offset="15403551">It's clear from the other evidence from the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.013" offset="15415463">I would submit that there is no evidence in the file at all, that is inconsistent with the claim of conscientious objector status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.992" offset="15455378">So that what the issue comes down to on the procedural questions is when does a draft board have to reopen?</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.835" offset="15498742">We would submit that the board must reopen whenever a pre-induction claim is made for a new classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.751" offset="15534373">I believe my time has expired Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.276" offset="15544508">Thank you.</text>
