            <text syncTime="363.436" offset="1557086">After the suit was filed but before there was any action taken if I may say respectfully, there was a bit of a raise to the courtroom doors, two courts involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.346" offset="1604733">Appellees sought a declaration that the statute is unconstitutional and an injunction against prosecution there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.588" offset="1637752">They alleged that the statute was overbroad because among other things adequately controlled commercial distribution of obscene material is protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.890" offset="1690937">The Court declined to grant injunctive or other relief but requested briefs on questions regarding the scope of this Court's holdings in Stanley versus Georgia and the effect of that opinion on the Massachusetts statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.897" offset="1758960">Prosecution continued in the state court in a jury weighed session and the appellees were convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.987" offset="1819355">After further argument, a majority of the court below held that Stanley versus Georgia went so far as to prohibit state prosecution with respect to adequately controlled public distribution of obscene material and the Court decided that the Massachusetts statute was probably unconstitutional as being overbroad on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.866" offset="1942862">Based on this opinion, a majority of the court below enjoined the appellants from further prosecution with respect to showing of the film of I Am Curious (Yellow).</text>
            <text syncTime="474.293" offset="2000541">I address myself first to the question, why did the court below abused its discretion in granting injunctive relief?</text>
            <text syncTime="484.557" offset="2041605">Committee and federalism prompt the federal judge to be extremely reluctant to enjoin good faith enforcement of a state's criminal laws by law enforcement officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.904" offset="4595022">I have no doubt in my experience as Attorney General that of extreme importance and primary importance in consideration of this Court today is the first point, that point of abstention as far as the Court, three-judge federal court in its action on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.977" offset="4679241">This is of extreme importance to all of us because in addition to the confusion, it establishes in the judicial system and in law enforcement administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.799" offset="4866591">That court gave great weight to the likelihood of success for the appellees here in their posture on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.953" offset="4907133">That success depends on the answer to the question, “Can public commercial dissemination of pornography be proscribed by any state?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.621" offset="4957811">Before Stanley versus Georgia, we submit that there was no doubt at all above this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.851" offset="4986755">Roth versus the United States, the leading case on this subject based that answer on the fact that obscenity is not protected speech within the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.578" offset="5041716">We agree with Mr. Justice Marshall that the holding in Stanley in no way impairs the principle so well annunciated in Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.262" offset="5084453">In fact, only last week, this Court summarily affirmed in Gable versus Jenkins number 1049 on the docket of the Court, a case involving action under a distinguishable statute in the same jurisdiction as Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.119" offset="5171806">Distinguishable from the statute in the Stanley case but a statute very much like that upheld in the Roth case and very much like the statute under consideration in the case at bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.895" offset="7170905">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.958" offset="7187205">At the outset, I should like to indicate as our amicus brief shows and as General Quinn has pointed out the interest of the United States in this case is limited to that aspect of the District Court's decision that considered and interpreted with this Court's holding in Stanley versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.946" offset="7271111">We therefore take no position on the procedural issue that is also involved in this case and it has been the subject to extensive briefing an argument by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.802" offset="7318549">I should like also to note the reasons for the Government's interest in this case as the Court well knows the Federal Government as well as the states has laws that bear upon the matter of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.049" offset="7387617">The Government bans the importation of obscene materials and the Federal Government again through a statute enacted by Congress proscribes the interstate mailing transportation through the mails of obscene materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.445" offset="7465148">In addition, as a treaty that the United States is a party too that the Court referred to in the Roth case in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion that requires the United States to take necessary steps to prohibit the international traffic in obscene materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.815" offset="7542680">Moreover, we have a number of pending cases as we refer to in our amicus brief in which the issue of meaning and effect of Stanley is centrally raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.152" offset="7591999">Those cases are working their way up to this Court but because this case is being considered this term and those cases will not -- we thought it's appropriate to express our views on the question of the meaning of Stanley at this point not to run the risk of not having an opportunity to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3278.758" offset="13218356">I don't think that's essential and it's no way essential in our case because even if one assumes that the indictment that was entered subsequent to the firing of the last amended complaint was one which was entitled to protection under 2283, the three-judge district court in this case in fact fully protected that prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.572" offset="13397661">The circumstances which prompted the entry of that order were solely and exclusively the fact that in the interim that state prosecution had gone through a trial and a judge had found the appellees in this case guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.011" offset="13463385">The state prosecutor then returned to the federal court and said that whereas heretofore, I have by stipulation permitted this film to continue its exhibition during the pendency of that trial, I hereby withdraw that stipulation and that appears in the transcript which is on file here in this Court several times.</text>
