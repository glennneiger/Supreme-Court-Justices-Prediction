            <text syncTime="30.291" offset="224528">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.842" offset="230693">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.376" offset="240828">This case brings into question, the constitutionality of Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.501" offset="285341">That Act provided in substance that before a labor union could resort to the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.117" offset="323793">Each of its officers most annually signed in filing non-Communist affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.899" offset="354931">The constitutionality of that statute was upheld in 1950 in the case of American Communications Association against Douds.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.370" offset="400802">The chief opinion was written by Chief Justice Vinson in which two other members of the court concurred, Justices Frankfurter and Jackson wrote separate opinions, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.097" offset="459734">Mr. Justice Black dissented on a number of grounds including explicitly an expression of his view of Section 9 (h) was a bill of attainder and therefore violated the Article I Section 9 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.501" offset="525354">Congress, it appears was not satisfied with its experience under Section 9 (h) and 12 years after its passage, nine years after this Court was persuaded to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.895" offset="578957">The Congress have repealed that law and replaced it with Section 504 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.277" offset="608528">That Section provided that it was a crime for a man simultaneously to hold union office and to be a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.818" offset="658683">That statute was held unconstitutional by this Court in United States against Archie Brown, 1965 in an opinion written by the Chief Justice, four other members of the Court concurring in the opinion on the expressed ground of Section 504 was unconstitutional bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.266" offset="740394">One of the questions certified in this case is whether in the comparative light of American Communications Association versus doubts and United States versus Brown, Section 9 (h) is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.858" offset="802774">Let me say a few words about the background of this case in order to put the other two certified questions in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.799" offset="834539">Petitioner here was one time the president of a small maritime labor union numbering some 3,000 members who served on vessels plying in and out of Pacific Coast Port in the Steward’s Department of those ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.086" offset="911757">In 1951, he signed and filed the affidavit as required -- that was required at the time under Taft-Hartley law.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.469" offset="949269">The union was and had been for some time engaged in the bitter jurisdictional dispute which ultimately led to the dissolution of the organization itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.224" offset="992319">Now, the affidavit that he filed was a printed form.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.745" offset="1006320">But the Labor Board supplied and it recited three basic things.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.208" offset="1028159">It recited that the files at the time he signed did not then support any organization that advocated the overthrow of the Government by force, violation or other unconstitutional or illegal means.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.872" offset="1082911">It provided second that he said he was then not a member of the Communist Party specifically naming the Communist Party in the second portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.385" offset="1120946">It provided third, that he was not then affiliate for the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.017" offset="1147486">In 1954, almost three yeas after the filing of the 1951 affidavit although I should state that in 1952 Bryson filed the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.534" offset="1189491">He did the same in 1953 and again in 1954 if my memory served me correctly, even after he was indicted on the 1951 affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.015" offset="1235466">He was charged in the indictment with three counts of violation, all three of the portions that I have mentioned</text>
            <text syncTime="290.949" offset="1267127">.Prior to the trial, the Government dismissed the count that charged him of supporting an organization that advocated the overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.739" offset="1306311">He went to trial on the counts concerning membership and concerning affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.239" offset="1328358">The jury returned the verdict holding or I should say that this was brought under the false statement statute which it set forth in our brief and in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.278" offset="1368482">Jury returned the verdict holding that when he swore that he was not been a member of the Communist Party he was not falsely swearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.394" offset="1400978">On the other hand, it returned the verdict holding that he did violate the law when he swore that he was not then affiliated for the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.342" offset="1440789">Bryson was sentence to five years in prison and a fine of $10,000 which was the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.340" offset="1468688">And in addition, the trial judge provided expressly that he could be subject to further imprisonment in the event that he failed to pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.562" offset="1509648">He served nearly two years of his term and then was paroled.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.994" offset="1527306">And in the intervening years he has managed to pay $2,000 of the $10,000 fine but the there is a balance of $8,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.531" offset="1569520">Shortly before we filed a petition in the District Court that commenced the proceedings that are now here, the Government noticed the taking of Bryson’s deposition of the original criminal proceeding and did take his -- the position seeking assets for the purpose of enforcing the collection of the $8,000 balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.464" offset="1661262">And thereafter, the Government filed a civil action in the Federal District Court in San Francisco seeking judgment for the $8,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.096" offset="1695744">A week or two after that, Bryson’s petition was filed with the District Court seeking a writ of error coram nobis or relief under the other applicable post-conviction statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.233" offset="1756348">One of the basic grounds upon which that relief was sought was the allegation that under United States versus Brown, the constitutional basis of Section 9 (h) had been eroded along with other decisions that it was constitutionally infirmed, that it should be controlled by the decision of this Court in United States against Brown and therefore that petition of original conviction had been unconstitutionally obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.358" offset="1860838">The District Judge granted petition in all respects except not granting the prayer for a return of the $2,000 that Bryson has paid to the Government on his fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.275" offset="1908485">The Government took an appeal to the Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit and that court in a per curiam decision reversed holding that Bryson was precluded for bringing his petition by reason of a decision of this Court in Dennis versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.499" offset="1981419">That case was a case in which this Court declined to review a challenge of constitutionality against Section 9 (h) upon the ground for the petitions in that case were shown to have been engaged in a conspiracy to deceive and to the defraud the Government and therefore that they had lost standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.214" offset="2072221">The Court of Appeals holding that Dennis presented an insuperable obstacle to us declined the test on the other questions and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.532" offset="2125511">The other two questions presented and certified here then are: One, whether the petitioner is precluded by reason of this Court’s decision in Dennis from attacking the constitutionality of 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="518.866" offset="2178800">The other is whether the petitioner qualifies regardless of Dennis upon the ground that it’s inapplicable in as much as this is a post-conviction proceeding and under the all writs section or under the other Section providing for such relief, he would qualify for this relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.520" offset="2309413">I can see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.140" offset="2311920">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.074" offset="2319653">However, the vitality of it still affects Bryson and as hope to argue also affects to its detriment to the bill of attainder provision in our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.620" offset="2389870">Now, let me say something about the petitioner of the evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.639" offset="2413902">Because I suppose in the last analysis, this Court is not going to look nearly at forms as the Government invites it to do and say well, in Dennis there was a conspiracy to defraud and Bryson’s case the jury found that he lied about whether or not he was affiliated with the Communist Party and therefore they are on a par, this is the Government’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.321" offset="2504704">I would suppose that if Dennis lays down a rule, the Court created by which the Court will determine in its own discretion whether or not a particular person is entitled to be heard has standing to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.420" offset="2577011">One must look at the character of the particular petitioner in so far at least as the record and the evidence would seem to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.804" offset="2606582">Now in petitioner’s case, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.224" offset="2620270">There’s no question that for a period of ten years between 1937 and 1947, he was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.242" offset="2652348">He was an officer of that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.486" offset="2661334">He was an officer under what was called the Waterfront Section Level in San Francisco and he was an officer on a state level, state committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.770" offset="2694457">There was no suggestion in this record that Bryson never tried to concede the fact that his membership or holding office in the communist party when he was a member of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.561" offset="2737612">Now in 1947, he terminated his associations and there is no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.504" offset="2761435">There was no evidence of the trial to sustain any charge that there was an active relationship between him and the party thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.447" offset="2793200">The evidence upon which he was convicted not of membership but of association of affiliation summarize by the Government in its brief, and I assume that they have called from it as much as there is and this is one of the matters to it that comes on pages 5 and 6 of the Government’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.640" offset="2885883">First, he said that in 1949, at an open union convention, he -- I quote what they say, “premised -- he refused to see that delegate to a union conversion premised on the delegate’s failure to accept an opportunity to join the Communist Party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="715.582" offset="2965713">So not only was that two years before he filed the affidavit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.451" offset="2985148">But I mentioned that this is the type of evidence on which the affiliation count was based.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.761" offset="3126418">One of which as the Government correctly points out was two months after he had filed his affidavit in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.610" offset="3161840">He then is supposed to use -- it was testified that he said in the course of an argument between him and one of the men who was forming a dual union, a rival union within the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.811" offset="3226624">He -- this man testified that Bryson said to him in the course of an angry exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.660" offset="3266017">There is another piece of testimony that was given by another person who in the course of -- who was expelled from the union or was in the process of being expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.968" offset="3311261">There was an argument about whether or not Bryson was discriminating against him or ordering him to be discriminated against in regard of getting union jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.618" offset="3349817">And the man testified that what you have to do to get a job around here, to be a party member of something of that kind and he said that might help and in reply to another question after Bryson said when he was accused, “are you still a member?”</text>
            <text syncTime="829.990" offset="3423378">He said, “yes and I’m proud of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="832.152" offset="3431946">That’s the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.111" offset="3439783">Now, the District Court told the jury what, based on the record, what’s the kind of evidence was that existed when Bryson was a member of the party and he told the jury that they should take him to consideration of whether or not he held office or official position on the Communist Party whether he have ever attended and participated communist party meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.460" offset="3545213">Whether or not he took instruction from communist party leaders, whether he participated in distributing literature, whether he solicited members for the party, whether or not he cooperated closely with and worked for there benefit and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.686" offset="3602160">There was evidence that during the period of executive membership, of his membership between 1937 and 1947, there was evidence that these were the activities in which he engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.048" offset="3643538">There was no evidence I might say that he ever advocated there was ever present when they was advocated or that he ever runs to it in whatever portion of the Communist Party he was associated with.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Gladstein</label>
            <text syncTime="948.587" offset="3897762">All of the arguments that are offered now were addressed to the courtroom when the case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.655" offset="3913958">That is we addressed these arguments on appeal to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals rejected the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.574" offset="3949693">This Court did not grant a position for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.100" offset="3963800">We saw twice first after the original conviction was upheld and I should say that in the petition for rehearing that we filed with the Court of Appeals calling their attention of the fact that in their first decision, we thought they were establishing de novo law.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.871" offset="4042898">They reiterated and they said I’ve copied on the sentence from their opinion which is referred to in our brief as well as in the Government’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.401" offset="4080933">They answer this by saying that although it was true that there was no evidence in the case of active affiliation, it didn’t have to be any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.588" offset="4121684">They said affiliation and this is the quote, “Affiliation is a relationship that can exist even when not manifested by activity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.038" offset="4159509">As to the argument that we advanced that had to be some showing that the communist party stood for either a calling, political strikes which was the purpose of Section 9 (h) according to the legislative history Congress wanted to inhibit the threat that political strikes might be called in the labor movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.984" offset="4263267">There was no evidence of anything of that sort either as to Bryson or as party but specifically as to Bryson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.294" offset="4292524">Never had he advocated or suggested or anything of that sort, although he was being found and in fact guilty because Congress assumed that anybody found to have been affiliated with the Communist Party was necessarily presenting threat to the country that he would throw the country into political strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.540" offset="4369533">The Court of Appeals answered that argument by saying that the requirement of adherence to Communist Party purposes was covered by the instruction to the jury that said in effect affiliation is a very difficult concept to define, I tell you in essence that its everything but membership been named only and suggested that it is comparable to the relationship between a man and a woman who are not married.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.872" offset="4486875">There was no instruction to the jury advising that affiliation could be found only if there was some evidence that Bryson adhered to some forbidden doctrine or that he advance some policy of believing some policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.500" offset="4557406">Whether it be the overthrow of the Government by violence or the calling of political strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.708" offset="4582170">Now, this was the evidence against the man and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.007" offset="4635355">He did not take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.370" offset="4644864">We’ve tried to show in our brief why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.734" offset="4658343">It was the practice then and it may still be that in cases of this kind or any kind perhaps where a person has been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.796" offset="4698572">It is uniformly the practice of the prosecutor to inquire on cross-examination for the names of other persons who were in the party at the time that the witness was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.953" offset="4759176">It was clear at the time and we set forth in detail the reasons that if he were asked questions of that kind and if he declined to become an informer, the person whose he had known long years ago in the Communist Party that he would be sentence to a jail term for contempt of court by the trial judge and of course that would take place on the presence of the jury and in he had any chance of becoming acquitted he would lose it with a thing like that happening as well as gaining a jail-term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.409" offset="4900968">But there’s some things to some man that are even more important than the risk of spending a term of years in prison and one of them as a matter of point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.681" offset="4954049">Bryson chose not to testify in order to avoid being placed in the dilemma of having to become either an informer or showing disrespect for the court by declining to answer questions that he would be ordered to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.318" offset="5028655">In the absence of Bryson’s testimony because he couldn’t under those circumstances, he was not a free agent to get up and either deny those statements that he claim had not been made that were attributed or if he made some of them to explain the context to them which they were made so that the jury could know what he as doing, what he was saying in the absence of his own ability to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.961" offset="5127189">In the presence of no evidence by the prosecution at all concerning association of activities, association of times or any kind with the party, we did what we considered the next best thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.616" offset="5185808">Fourteen witnesses, reputable people from various walks of the community were called and testified that he have to enjoy an excellent reputation for truth, honesty, and integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.547" offset="5233560">His record of having sailed on the seas for many, many years and being subject to the United States Coast Guard Regulations of course was a fact he had never been arrested on any charge either a charge of violating a regulation or for that matter a violation of any law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.220" offset="5596244">That I considered important for the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.994" offset="5627382">There’s no, nothing like that has being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.500" offset="5641383">But I would think that it’s relevant to the exercise of discretion if that’s what it’s involved if Dennis is a relevant decision to consider here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.047" offset="5679522">That will be important to consider what the record was, whatever the jury found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.130" offset="5699897">What the record was concerning Bryson so as to determine whether he compares with or contrasts with the defendants of the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.879" offset="5742843">And I wanted to -- one more thing concerning what happened there and that was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.265" offset="5764472">We called as a witness for the defense the agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who was in charge of the prosecution against the Bryson, and he testified that under cover informants and agents of the FBI were and have been throughout this period before and after 1947 within this group that Bryson at one time had been a member of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.214" offset="5880247">That no -- none of this informants, none of these agents testified and nobody came forward to testify against Bryson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.777" offset="5914520">Now, I realize that’s consistent with a policy decision by the FBI that it did not want for reasons of its own which it certainly has a right to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.183" offset="5960077">He did not want to reveal the identity of someone who was in that Section but its also consistent with the assertion that Bryson has steadfastly made from the beginning and has never deviated from that he was innocent, that he was neither a member nor affiliated with the Communist Party at any time after 1947.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.635" offset="6261948">I do not think that this Court’s decisions can possibly equate cases like the Kapp, those decisions which we treat in our brief at all with what this Court again and again has said to be rights that are enshrined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.471" offset="6365288">This case I think is controlled by Brown, United States against Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.757" offset="6390366">The statute as we took pains to show in our brief by calling from the Government’s brief in Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.416" offset="6429027">There the Government argued that 9 (h) and 504 were enacted to serve the same purpose, same substance, only the little difference in form and they were pains to show that the force exerted by 9 (h) was just as forceful just as effective just as punitive as 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.678" offset="6510111">If that was true then it’s equally true today, 504, I submit is controlling Dennis for the reasons I -- I’m sorry I took so much time to try to develop without a success would not on the facts of these case warrant or would not justify the Court in preventing Bryson from being hurt and moreover, in any event there are the post conviction statutes which entitle him by congressional enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.312" offset="6692655">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.925" offset="6707075">With all respect, the positions of the several parties in this case are something like ships passing in the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.559" offset="6737586">The counsel started with the proposition that the basic question here is the constitutionality of Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Harley Act repealed some ten years ago and then proceeded to spend, as the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, most of his time seeking it seemed to me to reopen and discuss again the basic underlying facts which have been found against petitioner at his jury trial some 15 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.122" offset="6875826">Now we look at the case somewhat differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.529" offset="6893484">As we understand it, the basic question here the basic issue that the Court repeals started was faced within principle on which we decided this case as to deal with the question of whether the rational of this Court in Dennis versus United States decided several terms ago applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.091" offset="7003721">In short, that rational is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.192" offset="7016155">That one who fains or purports to comply with the law by taking some sort of action that is required by the Government of him but in fact is proceeding falsely or fraudulently in so doing lacks standing when he’s discovered to a fact that fraudulently to challenge the law that he purported to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.771" offset="7146454">That principle was not established in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.818" offset="7158680">It goes back to earlier cases of this Court such as Kay and Kapp that’s been accepted by every circuit to my knowledge that has considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.977" offset="7211238">It simply, it seems to me basic principle of judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.926" offset="7255124">Any other rule would breed I would suggest disrespect for a law. It would invite avoidance or attempted avoidance of the orderly processes of law when one took it up himself to proceed fraudulently and then said well, yes I did that but it’s justifiable because the statute you see is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.141" offset="7371943">Now as we understand it, principally from petitioner’s brief, he suggests that there are several respects in which Dennis is distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.673" offset="7414053">He says first that Dennis involved a conspiracy and this case does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.479" offset="7441324">What’s true as the Court ordered or noted in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.897" offset="7462954">Some of the petitioners involved in conspiracy they are charged which was conspiracy to defraud the Unites States by doing exactly the same the petitioner did filing false affidavits under Section 9 (h) of Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.011" offset="7527424">The court noted there that at least some of the petitioners could have been charged under the false statement act that petitioner himself was charged under 18 U.S.C. 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.810" offset="7574653">I take it the reason they weren’t, it was because some of the petitioners who allegedly and were found to have engaged in the conspiracy there were not themselves union officers required to file this affidavits, but instead participated with union officers in the conspiracy to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.524" offset="7661484">We cannot really see that the fact that a conspiracy was charged and was involved in Dennis is a substantial -- it makes that case of substantial difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.369" offset="7712893">There’s some language in the Court’s opinion in Dennis that refers to the fact of conspiracy but as we understand at that language related basically to a threshold issue in Dennis is to whether the indictment was appropriate there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.793" offset="7770572">And the Court concluded that it was appropriate over strenuous arguments made in the contrary and in the course of that noted that a conspiracy was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.642" offset="7829922">Petitioner also notes that the case is now on collateral and not direct review and in that respect differs from Dennis and for some reason that these presents a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.723" offset="7902229">Now, we’re quite aware the increasing breath of the scope for collateral review but we had not thought that we have reached the point where collateral was broader than direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.719" offset="7966281">And it seems to us that it’s a rather difficult notion to accept that petitioners are in better position with respect to the basic rational on which the Court relied in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.651" offset="8030020">Individuals involved in Dennis because he is now on collateral and not on direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.208" offset="8060217">Petitioner also suggests and has argued in great length that his facts are different than the facts in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.167" offset="8100028">Well, frankly we don’t quite understand that and his brief he relies extensively on affidavit that he filed on a later collateral proceeding and here he is noted that Mr. Bryson terminated all relationship with the Communist Party in 1947, at least in his view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.832" offset="8194696">Now of course that was one of the issues that jury had to resolve and has not indicated that the jury resolve that against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.441" offset="8229177">In so far as he seeks to reopen and re-litigate those facts, it seems to us that’s not an appropriate question presented in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.421" offset="8269093">Question of supposed ambiguity of the notion of affiliation is also raised by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.636" offset="8305873">There may well be contacts in which the notion of affiliation with the Communist Party or some other organizations would be a difficult and dubious thing to present to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.558" offset="8365641">But as Mr. Justice Stewart noted in the context here under a very narrow and limiting instruction which is set out in the Government’s brief which followed and was confirmed by this Court’s decision in Killian case pages 6 and 7 of the Government’s brief note 5 we set out the basic construction.</text>
