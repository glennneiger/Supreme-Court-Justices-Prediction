            <text syncTime="152.208" offset="712182">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.584" offset="725661">As this is a rather complex case, it might be useful at the outset to state a very brief outline form how I expect to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.734" offset="762337">As the Court knows, the case principally involves Section 37 of the Leasing Act of 1927 which provides for the patenting of certain mining claims to federal land which were valid in 1920 and which in the words of the statute were thereafter maintained in accordance with the prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.213" offset="848227">So after the statement, I mean first to examine the history of the law statements regarding the maintenance of the mining claims in the public domain and I do that in full consciousness of the difficulties which the Solicitor General just spoke of about lawyer's history but nonetheless feeling it is necessary to reexamine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.512" offset="937462">Then I mean to cast a critical eye of this Court's decision in Ickes versus Virginia-Colorado Development Corporation which is the other focus of this case not necessarily to procure its overruling although we think and desire that it should be overruled but is a means of making clear at least the reasons --</text>

            <text syncTime="236.306" offset="1048639">As a means of making clear the reasons at least why we feel it must be limited to its particular facts and that I hope then leads naturally to the questions of review which are also present in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.306" offset="1096600">This case is part of a battle over ownership rights to several hundred thousands of acres of land in Colorado and larger amounts in Utah and Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.363" offset="1132857">All of this land contains a rock called oil shale from which oil can be distilled at a high temperature and no one knows quite how much oil is there or will ever be recovered, but the amounts are huge and I think there will be agreement that it represents at least a century of this nation's present rate of consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.331" offset="1208717">The oil shale which is already in private hands represents about a decade of that century or perhaps more at -- and is at present technically the most feasible portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.471" offset="1257305">The oil shale over which owner should the ownership dispute involve in this case is raging represents a similar period and is also in the technically accessible portion of the shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.831" offset="1302653">The dispute generally is whether (Inaudible) in the technically assessable portion of the shale that the depth of which the shale is buried under the overburden varies from place to place and private claims tend to be in the area where itâ€™s most accessible.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.137" offset="1507871">No one is yet mining although the Oil Shale Corporation certainly has plans in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.209" offset="1532217">The dispute generally is whether persons who made claims to oil shale lands before the lands were withdrawn from the possibility of claim in 1920 had any obligation to develop their claims after that time or could simply hold them in speculation for indefinite periods of time without an obligation of maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.649" offset="1613928">If the federal government has clear title to the lands, then it will be able to sell leases to persons whom on condition really that they develop it and it will be able to collect substantial royalties once they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.051" offset="1663561">If it must sell or patent the lands to the present claimants of whom respondents here are only representative, it must recognize rights on land which have been left completely undeveloped for 33 years and for which there would be no guarantee of development in the future and it would receive only $2.50 an acre as its total price and there are also obvious differences in the Government's ability to control pollution, water use and other environmental factors and to guide a rational development to the resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.835" offset="1794696">These particular cases here as a result of the Secretary's refusal in 1964 to issue certain patents to oil shale lands including lands held by three of the respondents here or groups of respondents I should say, those represented by respondents Napier, Umpleby, and Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.664" offset="1870033">He refused those patents on the ground that the claims had been cancelled in 1931 and early 1932 an administrative proceedings which were permitted to become final at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.320" offset="1916635">It is clear that he probably would also have refused to patent the claims now owned by the Oil Shale Corporation which represents the fourth group of respondents, if those claims had been before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.060" offset="1959581">Since those claims too had been cancelled in default proceedings in the early 30s, then these cancellations were part of a concerted effort on the Secretaryâ€™s part to identify and cancel claims that were not being maintained in the early 30s when evidence was conservatively fresher than it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.076" offset="2027708">We said that history out at some length in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.842" offset="2042755">The first three sets of claimants Napier, Umpleby, and Brown sought review of the Secretary's 1964 decision in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado and there, they were joined by the Oil Shale Corporation seeking declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.333" offset="2104717">Although respondents heard a number of reasons below for requiring the Secretary to ignore these old and final administrative decisions from the 30s, the District Court and subsequently the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit considered only one ground which was that the administrative decisions have been beyond the Secretary subject matter jurisdiction and therefore could be given no effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.749" offset="2922350">It would be one step along the way towards procuring patents for the Union Oil Company.</text>
