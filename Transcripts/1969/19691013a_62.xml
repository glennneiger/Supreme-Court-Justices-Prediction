            <label>Mr. John J. Loflin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="55.939" offset="328161">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.416" offset="350104">In this case unlike the California case you just have described, there were two separate statutory forms of benefits involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.449" offset="390228">The federal benefits which are substantially the same as those in the California case and what in New York is known as home relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.168" offset="425023">The presence of the home relief recipients as plaintiffs in the cases that are here consolidated accounted for at least in part the decision of the court below to reach constitutional issues rather than leave the decision to rest upon a statutory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.588" offset="514779">They reasoned that even if they could resolve the case as to the federal beneficiaries, they would still have to face the problem of what to do about the state recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.731" offset="559292">So without pausing on that question, they went into the constitutional area.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.504" offset="586459">These three cases here consolidated as per substantially identical relief, that is, as it went to the three-judge court below, plaintiffs were asking for a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to cease terminations without having a prior hearing which according to plaintiff's judgment would meet the standards of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.190" offset="689173">In addition, they wanted a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.504" offset="710384">As we got to the three judge hearing stage, the declaratory judgment section of their relief focused upon a new New York State regulation which was in fact promulgated after the first of these cases was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.370" offset="769839">I would like to dwell for a moment on the sequence of events because it did have some influence I believe on the decisions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.460" offset="802231">At the time the first of these cases was filed in New York, there was no pre-termination conference hearing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.769" offset="839429">It was entirely possible and frequently happened that a beneficiary would simply receive a notice in saying your benefits have been cutoff, refer to your handbook or your pamphlet as to any rights you might have to have a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.713" offset="899197">This led to unfortunate circumstances, unfortunate damage to a number of recipients and led directly to the filing of a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.372" offset="941934">Shortly after the suit was filed, New York State followed California in adopting a pre-termination regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.173" offset="973072">Now this is a regulation which is here before this Court, Number 351.26.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.934" offset="1004105">As you may know in the State of New York, well over half of the total welfare recipients reside in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.338" offset="1033780">The state however promulgated this new regulation without consultation with the city; it reached the city officials in late February and was to become effective by its terms on March 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.777" offset="1083517">The state however did not provide hearing officers or training or any real guidelines much less any financing so that this machinery could be setup on what was at the time two or three days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.661" offset="1139001">The city reacted to this by asking for conferences with the state officials to see if the impact of this new procedure on the city administration could be less.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.421" offset="1186126">In fact, after a series of conferences at which the difficulties of enforcing the new state regulation in a city with approximately 1 million people on welfare was pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.681" offset="1235132">The state resented its original regulation and then at the same time put out the regulation which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.175" offset="1273062">It consists of two parts, 351.26 (a) and 351.26 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="344.358" offset="1481832">Now, both of these subparagraphs that is (a) and (b) were challenged by the plaintiffs below.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.637" offset="1522897">The court examined both of them, held in fact that subparagraph (b) which had been adopted in New York City was unconstitutional as not affording proper due process of law and in particular, the deficits that they pointed out were the lack of confrontation and cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.052" offset="1608579">The three-judge court in the southern district saw no room for that in the procedure before it under subparagraph (b) and held that those were essential elements which must be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.019" offset="1660510">And since there was some ambiguity as to subparagraph (a), they construed subparagraph (a) to require confrontation and cross examination of adverse witnesses and said in effect, “If you don't operate it in that fashion, that Section too would be unconstitutional and a denial of due process of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="411.428" offset="1750058">The state did not appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.902" offset="1759984">The city with an interest in subparagraph (b) is here before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.496" offset="1794361">It is vital to our case for the court to understand that we do not rest alone on subparagraph (b) of 351.26.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.224" offset="1837307">It is the pattern or regulation in the State of New York for a city welfare district particularly, one of the size of the city in New York to adopt its own implementing regulations subject to state approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.467" offset="1886312">That was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.893" offset="1895926">Our local regulation is known as procedure 68-18.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.964" offset="1916301">Now that is set forth in the record following pages 147 and 148.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.796" offset="1943573">I stress the importance of our local procedure because I think the court needs to have the full process before you and understand particularly how the client first becomes involved in these procedural steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.017" offset="2000415">Under our local procedure, the caseworker is obliged to notify the client when information comes to him indicating there is a question as a continued eligibility to receive benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.915" offset="2060079">The caseworker has the duty of calling the client in and discussing these matters with them in a face to face conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.281" offset="2089545">The client is in a position then to discover what it is that has led the city to believe that this person is no longer eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.102" offset="2124758">That client is in a position to tell the city why it is making a mistake if it is and to correct error if error there be.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.068" offset="2160703">In the event, the caseworker determines after a conference with the client that there is probable reason to conclude that the client is in fact no longer eligible, the case file in the caseworker's recommendation go to the unit supervisor where the entire matter is subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.992" offset="2240324">It is only if the unit supervisor concurs in the judgment of the caseworker, does the formal notice contemplated by 351.26 (b) issues -- that notice tells the recipient --</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.698" offset="12511148">Even under the Government's test in its memorandum of whether more eligible than ineligible people request these hearings, we would prevail in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.629" offset="12794943">We also would ask this Court to recognize in looking at the burdens or non-burdens that there can be no question that the effect of the present procedure of postponing and seriously postponing the fair hearing is to deter and discourage its use to the extent that prior hearings will be used more as a result of removing this deterrence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3943.727" offset="15879272">Now I would refer if I may to the section of my main brief on pages 14 and 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.165" offset="15909052">Our procedures have been sharply criticized here and it has been pointed out by my adversary that under paragraph (a) which is his preferred procedure, a number of reversals of caseworker decisions have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.429" offset="15966104">We had a brief period, just a few months roughly from June to November of 1968 during which the City of New York operated under the provisions subparagraph (b) in its local procedure, 6818.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.079" offset="16032664">During that period, approximately 44% of the decisions to terminate were reversed as a result of our own procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.031" offset="16068504">I submit to the Court that our procedures were working and during that same period of time, as is true now, some of our cases then went on to the fair hearing stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.842" offset="16111762">During those same months, the reversals on termination cases after fair hearings did not exceed three cases per month and in one month, September 1968, there were no reversals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.864" offset="16159828">I think this is a demonstration that goes beyond the face of the regulations itself that the procedure is designed to be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.755" offset="16195459">It is designed to weed out error and it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.878" offset="16211864">This Court has on other occasions and in other contexts molded constitutional requirements appropriate to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.057" offset="16248644">Due process has been described as a flexible, not a fixed concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.617" offset="16270900">It might also be noted that under the Fourth Amendment, in the Kamara and See cases where there was a question of the burden of proof on a locality before a warrant should be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.278" offset="16313532">It was found by this Court that the burden of proof need not be quite as high as in a traditional criminal warrant search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.171" offset="16341117">There is room for innovation at the local level, in state and local governments and I feel that our innovation meets the standards that this Court has indicated or required for due process.</text>
