            <text syncTime="14.829" offset="162670">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.809" offset="178657">This case is before the Court for the second time having been here previously on order of this Court granting a petition for writ of certiorari at the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.938" offset="219094">At same time is which the Court vacated the judgment of Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and remanded the proceeding to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of the case of Jones against Alfred H. Mayer Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.953" offset="287222">That was in the 1967 term of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.424" offset="305089">Last year, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals after we seek of this Court's mandate refused to accept the remand to reconsider the case in light of the Mayer case and issued an opinion indicating that it would not take the case back for the same reason that it refuse to entertain the appeals on the first occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.644" offset="393906">The reason stated being petitioners alleged failure to comply with certain procedural rule of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.111" offset="439777">The Court indicated that it did not had jurisdiction over the proceeding in the first instance and that therefore did not have jurisdiction to accept the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.076" offset="491708">We petition for certiorari and the Court -- the case is now here again on the Court's granting of this second petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.270" offset="528488">By granting the first petition for certiorari, the Court impliedly held that the nonfederal ground of decision for the State Court with the nonfederal ground upon which the State Court decided the case was inadequate to support the judgment and that the federal question should therefore be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.894" offset="618977">The State Court by failing to accept the remand, by failing to comply with this Court's mandate, we submit has fail to observe its responsibilities under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.525" offset="669445">We are now before the Court with the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.483" offset="689298">The case -- the principal issues in the case concern the matter of whether a community recreation association may engage in racially discriminatory policies and practices within the -- under the proscriptions contained of the 1866 -- Civil Rights Act of 1866 which this Court construed in Jones against Alfred Mayer Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.517" offset="793475">And whether also those racially discriminatory practices are banned or prohibited by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.558" offset="829628">The second question -- major question that is, is whether a party was a member of this local recreation association and dissents from its policies may consonant with the protections afforded by the 1866 law in the Constitution be expelled for his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.326" offset="928684">Briefly, the facts are that Little Hunting Park Incorporated is a nonstop corporation organized under the Virginia law for the purpose of providing a community recreation facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.974" offset="987303">It has a swimming pool, tennis courts and a park and picnic area.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.571" offset="1009664">The bylaws has provide that its facilities are available and membership is available to anyone living within prescribed neighborhood, a prescribed geographic area consisting of four real estate subdivisions plus such adjacent areas or additional areas as the Board of Directors might decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.952" offset="1099212">The membership in the association is obtained by the purchase or assignment of shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.815" offset="1130663">Shares maybe purchase for a sum of money and they may also be obtained upon assignment from landlord to tenant, these are provisions of the bylaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.078" offset="1191685">There is a limit of 600 shares in the association and the record shows that in the history of this association's existence namely from 1955 to 1965 -- excuse me, 1965 to 1966 when the trial was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.492" offset="1277367">Shares had been uniformly permitted that is assignment and transfer of shares have been uniformly permitted by the Board of Directors of the association all such purchases and assignments of shares being subject to approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.295" offset="1348524">The only occasion for an the assignment or refusal to permit an assignment having occurred at the time of the incidents which are alleged to herein to be the basis for this action namely the refusal to permit the assignment from the one pool of Sullivan, to Dr. Theodore Freeman because of the latter's race -- the -- Dr. Freeman being a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.306" offset="1472554">The situation involving these two parties came about as follows: Mr. Sullivan, a white man had owned property in the neighborhood covered by the bylaws of the association and in 1955 or 1954 when the association have been formed had purchased a share which he used so long as he live in a house on Condor Road in Fairfax County, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.539" offset="1597524">He, after 11 years, moved to another house as part of the purchase price of the second house purchased a second share in the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.978" offset="1639320">In the meantime, he continued to rent the first property and as part of the lease made a practice of assigning the share in the association that he'd purchased as to accompany the first piece of property of the first house.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.804" offset="1714552">So, Mr. Sullivan owned two shares, he owned two houses, the first house he rented out.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.920" offset="1739003">In 1965, rented the first house to Dr. Freeman and as part of the lease provided for the assignment of the share in the association it went along with that property.</text>

          <turn speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="492.656" stopTime="736.144">
            <label>Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="492.656" offset="2073997">So far as I know, there is no such claim sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.808" offset="2086640">There was a suggestion of this raised in the opposition to the first petition for certiorari or maybe it was a second petition and we filed a responds to that pointing out the point -- the place is in the record showing conclusively that race was the reason for the disapproval of the membership assignment and the issue has not been raised now in respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.777" offset="2186428">As a result of Mr. Sullivan's disappointment with the failure of the association Board of Directors to approve this assignment to Dr. Freeman, Mr. Sullivan sought to find out why the assignment had not been approved and he sought to within the association work out means within the neighborhood where this had occurred, he sought to bring about a reversal of the -- what he thought to be a discriminatory refusal to approve this assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.347" offset="2324773">As a result of his activities with among, both within the association and among persons in the neighborhood such as leaders in the church, other community leaders, the association Board of Directors expelled Mr. Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.003" offset="2399378">The two actions here seek: one, relief Mr. Sullivan, we seek his reinstatement into the association and damages for the injury that he has suffered by as a result of the expulsion; and secondly, we seek a -- damages for Dr. Freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.827" offset="2490702">Dr. Freeman is no longer in the county, is no longer in the neighborhood, no longer lives in the neighborhood served by the association and although an injunctive remedy maybe a future value to him that it is of no immediate value because he doesn't live there and we seek damages on his behalf for the discrimination that he suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.711" offset="2590177">We think there is little doubt but what the 1866 Civil Rights Act which this Court construed in Jones against Mayer applies to this, to the facts of this case that the provisions of law involved are contained presently in 42 U.S.C Sections 1981 and 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.947" offset="2683173">The Section 1981 grants Negroes the same rights as white persons to make an enforce contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.401" offset="2717027">Section 1982, provide Negroes -- grants Negroes the same right as white persons to inherit purchase and lease, real and personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.338" offset="2760704">The -- we have shown, the record shows that the -- both of these provisions of the law are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.622" offset="2805844">There was a contract between Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Freeman which provided for the assignment of the share involved and the Board of Directors of the association refused to permit the consummation of that -- or the performance of that contract because of the race of Dr. Freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.301" offset="2888600">The -- so that would make Section 1981 applicable on its face, Section 1982 of 42 U.S.C. we believe is applicable under the -- by virtue of the fact that the shares of the membership share here is a personal property and the membership share also constitutes and membership in the association constitutes an incident of the real property and it indeed it was a part of the lease hold interest that Dr. Freeman obtained from Mr. Sullivan.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.475" offset="3109282">Well, I'm not certain to that if -- I just don't know the answer sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.676" offset="3166124">When we started this action because this Court had not yet construed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, we press in addition a constitutional basis for our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.720" offset="3222235">Under this Court's decision in Evans versus Newton, we felt that this association perform the same function as Bakers Field Park which was at issue in the Evans against Newton case namely that it was a public facility which provided public recreation and that it had all of the attributes of a public facility of the sort that were at issue in Evans against Newton.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.894" offset="3338951">We still would continue to press this as an alternative ground for a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.236" offset="3368312">As far as Dr. Freeman is concerned, we think that both the 1866 law and constitutional provisions warrant his obtaining relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.202" offset="3432155">As far as Mr. Sullivan is concerned, the record shows that he was expelled from this association essentially for dissenting from its racially discriminatory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.518" offset="3485445">He, under the law, was required to deal with Dr. Freeman on a nondiscriminatory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.466" offset="3513240">When he sought to do so, his action was frustrated, it was thwarted and when he sought to reverse the action of the Board of Directors and engaged in legitimate means of dissent or legitimate means to try and reverse the Board of Directors' action, he was expelled, he was punished, the action was retaliatory, it was by way of reprisal and we indeed feel that this action may not be permitted to stand under relevant authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.712" offset="3658271">The case that's most analogous is that of Barrows versus Jackson, which is discussed in our brief and in the amicus brief of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.727" offset="3694320">There, you will recall that a party who had failed to comply with a discriminatory racial covenant was sued for damages and this Court held that he could rely on -- that he could defend by relying on the constitutional right of the Negro who was involved that the law protected him in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.373" offset="3784913">We think that the circumstances here are certainly analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.355" offset="3816782">The -- we have reviewed in our brief the various charges that were brought against Mr. Sullivan as the alleged basis for his discharge -- excuse me, the alleged basis for his expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.747" offset="3890343">We have demonstrated, I believe, that his expulsion was that there were whole series of charges that were brought against him that were in the nature of exaggerations and some instances alleged outright falsehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.550" offset="3961605">All of which served the purpose of which serves the pretext for the -- to mask the hostility that the, and resentment that the directors of this association felt against him first for creating this controversy by attempting to assign his membership to a Negro and then by not accepting the decision which they had made to deny the negro of the assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.576" offset="4081664">The -- an important aspect of the case which I've not cared to over look and I'd like to deal with for moment if I may, concerns the matter of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.213" offset="4156270">In a supplemental brief that we filed, we attempted to response to the point which the Government had made in its amicus curiae brief namely that the plaintiffs here may not be entitled to punitive damages because the Acts involved occurred before this Court had construed the 1866 law in Jones against Mayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.309" offset="4268596">We, I think, have responded to that in a sense of showing that punitive damages are not foreclosed merely because the action took what the acts took place before the resurrection of the 1866 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.465" offset="4337246">The point I would like to make is this and I did not cover this in our brief because, frankly, the -- what I am about to say had not quite jelled in my mind at the time I wrote the supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.372" offset="4388864">And that is that we feel that there is a right established on this record by both parties to compensatory damages for the injuries that they have suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.232" offset="4440273">We think also that they are both entitled to punitive damages and we think that this is an important part of the case primarily in the case of Dr. Freeman because he is not in this country any longer.He is how with the United States Embassy in Tokyo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.080" offset="4515715">The question of punitive damages, I think, as far as Mr. Sullivan is concerned is quite well shown or exploited in our brief and we showed it on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.031" offset="4563466">His expulsion from the association was motivated by attitudes of hostility, resentment, a desire to act if by way of reprisal against him because of what he had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.597" offset="4645804">These are the elements of malice or these are the elements that constitute malice and which are basis for assessing punitive damages as far as Mr. Sullivan is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.909" offset="4775058">But, in which it suggested that the parties may not have on those pleadings made that a case warranting punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.451" offset="4813197">Now, we when we ask for punitive, we've have asked for compensatory and punitive damages all the way along here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.473" offset="4845275">And the thing that I want to indicate is that in the case of Dr. Freeman, there are no facts it might appear from the record which would warrant punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.926" offset="4895117">But I would submit that he was the victim of racial discrimination and that racial discrimination as a matter of law warrants the imposition of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.486" offset="4949347">Race discrimination is unjustified, race discriminations cannot be rationalize to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.737" offset="4982366">Race discrimination is based on hatred, prejudice, bias, it has no justification as it comes a matter of the employing malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.641" offset="5045896">There's malice in law, there is implied malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.921" offset="5063032">These are recognized in other fields of the law and we submit that when a person is the victim of racial discrimination, there is implied malice and that punitive damages are warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.558" offset="5113605">We feel that it's particularly important here to -- in this respect and that is to achieve the full effectiveness of this 1866 Act that the Court would be well warranted in giving meaning to this concept of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.608" offset="5193853">There is indiligence to it the Court said that where suddenly protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that the Courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant necessary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.024" offset="5263444">Now, this case is probably one of the last perhaps sometime that will come before the Court involving this 1866 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.047" offset="5303568">In order to give full effect to this law, we submit that punitive damages should be awarded and should be recognized as a valid remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.090" offset="5335751">The 1964 Civil Rights Act, the public accommodation provisions of it have no damages remedy attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.882" offset="5366888">There is only injunctive relief that is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.912" offset="5382980">Since, if damages are allotted at all here, it seems to me, that it would be appropriate for the Court to spell out both the right of a party to obtain both the compensatory and punitive damages and as I say where punitive -- where discrimination against the Negro occurs for no other reason than his race or color punitive damage, it's an inherently malicious act, inherently malicious and punitive damages should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.255" offset="5492381">Here, it's particularly appropriate, you know, because the Court -- the Board of Directors of this association refused repeatedly to ever meet Dr. Freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.663" offset="5534072">Dr. Freeman was an eminently qualified individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.014" offset="5547447">He has a PhD degree from the University of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.156" offset="5563956">He's an agricultural economist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.571" offset="5569703">He's a captain in the District Columbia National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.585" offset="5581720">He had eminent qualifications, they never met him, they didn't want to meet him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.952" offset="5599169">They knew he was black and that was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.565" offset="5609618">That is malice in law and warrants punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.757" offset="5858408">And on the basis of the failure in this particular case for counsel to serve need with an adequate notice, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia refuse to hear this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.391" offset="5912952">Now, they based it on the case of Snead versus Commonwealth which was a criminal case in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.010" offset="5943463">Snead's counsel presented the transcript 30 minutes before -- to the counsel, before he submitted to the judge for certification and on the basis of this, the Virginia Court said that 30 minutes was not reasonable and therefore since it was not reasonable and the requirement was jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.767" offset="6030399">Therefore, they would not hear Mr. Snead's appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.795" offset="8330533">We must look at the rest of Title 42 including that Section which is known as a Public Accommodations Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.978" offset="8363238">And this provides that all persons shall be entitled to the use of facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.641" offset="8673886">Now, if we're contending it as a club, we have to know what a club means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.825" offset="8702621">Webster defines a club as an association of persons for some common object, specially one jointly supported meaning periodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.073" offset="8739715">Now, I refer to Black maybe for legal definition and Black says a word, club has no very definite meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.007" offset="8767404">Clubs are formed for also its purposes and there was no uniformity in their constitution and rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.332" offset="8792691">It is well known that clubs exist which limit the number of their members and select them with great care which own considerable property in common and in which the furnishing of food and drink to the members for money is not but one of the many conveniences with the members -- which the members enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.013" offset="8859460">Now, Little Hunting Park started out as a group of people buying land and putting up tennis courts, a building, swimming pool for their own purpose and those that they elected to join them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.073" offset="8931662">They provided in their bylaws, they setup a secured charter from the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.273" offset="8952456">And in this charter, they use the word community and this is a basis of the petitioner's case as a fact for the use of word “community.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.982" offset="8991326">And looking at Webster's definition of community, community as we think of now the community meaning a public that was a second definition, the community is a community of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.274" offset="9044511">At the same time they drafted bylaws and the bylaws say that they are operating only for their members.</text>
