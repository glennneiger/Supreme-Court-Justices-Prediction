            <text syncTime="43.972" offset="279280">As I stand here in this place where many great men have stood before this August body of our government, I'm reminded of an incident that occurred in the Supreme Court of Georgia before Judge Douglas in my early years in the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.960" offset="367261">In addressing that body, I was arguing with all my might the point of law and the late Chief Justice of that Court said to me, Mr. Wallace, we are not interested in hearing your version of the law, remember, we make it here, we'd rather hear something about the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.710" offset="466213">With that thought in mind, and this being my first appearance before this great body and with the indulgence of the Court, I would like if permissible to give a thumbnail sketch of just what happened in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.853" offset="554820">In 1962 in October, the petitioner in Certiorari Earl Price was indicted in Effingham county, superior -- Georgia Superior Court for the offense of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.639" offset="629948">The following day, he was tried in that Court for murder before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.292" offset="660564">The judge, the trial judge is now deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.035" offset="687522">The key is that the jury brought in a verdict on the trial of murder of voluntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.153" offset="723989">They said nothing about the murder charge in their verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.939" offset="747081">The verdict merely said, we the jury find the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter and fixed his punishment from 10 to 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.230" offset="804342">I took that case to the Court of Appeals for review of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.887" offset="834957">It was reversed on an erroneous charge of the late judge Walton Usher.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.593" offset="873723">In 1967 in October, the same man was called upon in the same Court, under the same indictment for the same offense of murder, to answer and to plea to the charge of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.109" offset="983855">Prior to the trial of the case, second time in 1967, I filed a plea in the Court of former jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.459" offset="1029204">The plea was argued at length and the Court overruled my plea of Double Jeopardy and the case went to trial, the second time, not for manslaughter but under the same indictment, grand jury indictment for the same offense before a jury and before the same trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.293" offset="1144560">That jury brought in a verdict of guilty and said nothing about murder or voluntary manslaughter as did the first jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.672" offset="1194088">Fixing his sentence at 10 years rather than 10 to 15 years as the first jury did.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.378" offset="1248841">The usual procedure was followed and the case was again appealed to the Court of Appeals for Georgia and the Supreme Court of Georgia I believe and they sent it to the Court of Appeals and then it went back by a certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia and we are now in this Court for an opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.221" offset="3680214">I would say as reluctantly as it is as I can that Benton versus Maryland is applicable to this case but not so much because of what Benton versus Maryland says, but because it made Green applicable to this case and the implied Acquittal Doctrine which was a federal principle prior to Benton versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.895" offset="3770911">I don't believe that I can escape the implied acquittal doctrine for Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.595" offset="3797765">I'm particularly persuaded to this decision by the fact that the Chief Justice in his dissent in Ashe versus Swenson emphasized the fact that the phrase, run the gauntlet in Green meant as to that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.748" offset="3866415">Now, I'm afraid that in this case that is perhaps what has happened to Mr. Price.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.708" offset="4014164">I'm suggesting that because in the state of Georgia, of course, they do not come back and say that he is acquitted of murder and he is found guilty of voluntary manslaughter as were the facts in this case, but in the State of Georgia, they can return a verdict for manslaughter and it maybe because and this suggests conjecture but it maybe because the crime does not warrant the punishment which murder would require, that is death or life imprisonment, that is required by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.592" offset="4137775">It maybe that the facts as presented to the jury or such that they may feel that this doesn't warrant that kind of punishment and yet there is sufficient evidence that would warrant a voluntary manslaughter conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.063" offset="4187617">I might add also that in the State of Georgia, a jury may bring back a conviction for a lesser crime even though they were not charged on that lesser crime where the evidence warrants it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.757" offset="4606412">This brings to mind a very important point and I want to emphasize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.223" offset="4624280">It is my contention as my brother said out to the Court that I would urge this Court to find that this man has not been harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.325" offset="4652701">I recognized the harmful error as a proposition that states perhaps overemphasized the fact that there is not harmful error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.195" offset="4700139">I say here there was no harmful error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.526" offset="4709439">This man was initially sentenced to 10 to 15 and under the old law of Georgia that would have meant that he would have been eligible for a conditional release which is tantamount to a parole at the end of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.547" offset="4761579">In 1964, the Georgia General Assembly changed the law and required that sentences be made definite and subsequently the -- and a second trial, Mr. Price was sentenced to 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.570" offset="4813615">This meant that he could get out at the end of five years and nine months assuming all good behavior, time off for good behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.610" offset="4841827">So he has received a material benefit by the act of the general assembly, but more importantly, he has not been harmed in what has happened I would submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.031" offset="4879548">If the Court is going to consider the Hetenyi proposition then it is considering that perhaps the jury could not or would not do its duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.378" offset="4916851">That it would not follow the directions of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.057" offset="4931584">In this particular situation, the jury rejected the charge of the Court as to murder and brought back the lesser charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.562" offset="4965648">I would submit to this Court that the record clearly shows that they did do their duty and it would only be conjecture that that they might have done something else had they not been -- had there not been evidence on murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.946" offset="8091146">And then further in the opinion this Court said that the double jeopardy provision is to protect three things, protection against repeated prosecutions after an acquittal, protection after a conviction and protection against the imposition of repeated punishments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allyn M. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3410.093" offset="13743731">Well, that's true and as I mentioned a moment ago, I personally paid for that record, I'm without Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.848" offset="13782810">I put a lot of time and effort in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.938" offset="13791169">I'm thoroughly convinced that this man is entitled to another trial on voluntary manslaughter and as I've said a moment ago, the trial judge in now deceased, that tried both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.080" offset="13839653">The Solicitor General has retired from office and I have some doubt in my mind that this case even though you referred back as I suggested will never be tried again, and now that's the way I feel about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.459" offset="13909243">Now, I'd like to for the last closing moments refer to the Ashe case versus Swenson, the warden and also Waller versus Florida case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.276" offset="13988446">And the Court said and that was on April of this year that these two decisions came down, this is not last year, as five years ago or back on in 1910 and this is very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.437" offset="14049155">There can be no doubt of the retroactivity of the Court's decision in Benton versus Maryland, that's ahead new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.319" offset="14092622">In North Carolina versus Pearce 395 US 711 decided the same day as Benton, the Court unanimously -- unanimously the Court had (fully retroactivity) effect of the Benton doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.154" offset="14183946">And they went on and said that any case as I interpret in the Waller case that any case that might come before this honorable body that might arise or fall in the end it -- of the Ashe case and the Waller case, that is within the bounds or any limits for this one issue are then these two cases would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.609" offset="14321768">Had no worn again the Waller case had and this was justice Brennan if I believe I'm not supposed to refer specifically to a justice but if Justice Brennan will pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.676" offset="14374118">I adhere to the Courts ruling in Ashe versus Swenson that our decision in Benton versus Maryland holding the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment applicable to the states in “fully retroactive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.184" offset="14444126">And they again referred to the North Carolina versus Pearce 395, I think that is a crux of my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.586" offset="14481742">I think the Benton case is retroactive in any case it might fall within its bounds and within the ambit of that case and I say that this Price case is one of those cases, and I'm asking this Court in all fairness to give this man the opportunity and as I've said I doubt and I have very serious doubt that this man will ever be tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.788" offset="14586546">I think even -- so wind it up because as I said I can't bring out anything outside the record, it was unfortunate that I couldn't bring a whole record because it was expensive and I've spent enough time and effort, this is my second day in Washington on this case without Pearce, that's how interested I'm in this case and this man getting what I think is justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.115" offset="14691871">I never take a case although like Pearce and that's why I'm here and I'm asking this honorable body to please consider my brief and what I have said here today, and grant this man another opportunity because he is entitled to it as I see though and I thank you all so much for listening to me and it had been a privilege to be have been here, this be my first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.601" offset="14789778">Thank you.</text>
