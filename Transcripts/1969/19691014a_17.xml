            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Hamburg, in number 17, United States against Knox.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.874" offset="130905">Are you ready?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Mervyn Hamburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.361" offset="144802">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.311" offset="160580">The issue involved in this case is related to the proceeding when -- in that involves a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 for making false statements in purported compliance with other statutes, in this case, certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code relating to wagering taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.008" offset="239365">The precise issue here is whether an individual may properly assert the privilege against self-incrimination as a complete defense to a charge of making false statements on wagering tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.144" offset="295999">The District Court in the Western District of Texas held that the privilege was such a defense and dismissed false statement charges against the appellee, James Knox.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.650" offset="338004">The case is here on the Government's appeal of that dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.570" offset="357648">The indictment was filed before this Court decided the Marchetti and Grosso cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.848" offset="382725">This indictment charged the appellee with four counts of failing to file wagering tax returns, that is Form 11-C, a copy of which we've included in our appendix, and with failure to pay the special occupational tax, covering various prior to October 14, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.761" offset="462451">The indictment also contains two counts, Counts Five and Six, which charge that the appellee made false statements on returns which he did file on October 14 and on October 15, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.706" offset="530160">The statements being that he declared under penalties of perjury that the returns were to the best of his knowledge, true, correct and complete whereas in truth, they were not in that the number of employees he had claimed had been understated and misrepresented.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.069" offset="603617">Now prior to trial, this Court decided Marchetti versus United States and Grosso versus United States and in those cases, this Court recognized that an individual charge with failing to file wagering tax forms which invariably contained information incriminating him under other laws, could properly assert that privilege, the privilege against self-incrimination as a complete defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.430" offset="713122">Thereafter, the appellee moved to dismiss all of the charges against him including Counts Five and Six, the false statement Counts alleging that such a disposition was required as a result of the holding of the Marchetti and Grosso.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.331" offset="780727">The Government responded that it intended to pursue only Counts Five and Six and as to those counts it argued in effect that their validity had not been affected by Marchetti and Grosso.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.381" offset="828897">The District Court disagreed with the Government's position and in a brief memorandum, dated July 24, 1968, the Court -- that Court held that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination prevents prosecution for failure to answer the form in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.572" offset="901622">Judge Roberts relied upon Grosso in particular where charge of conspiracy to evade payment of the excise tax on wagering was dismissed along with the substitute charges of failing to pay the excise tax and failing to pay this special computational tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.327" offset="976645">In the Government's view, Judge Roberts misinterpreted and misapplied the Court's decisions, particularly Grosso.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.443" offset="1009142">Thus I believe, it's appropriate to begin with the discussion of the difference between Grosso and this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.020" offset="1043414">In Grosso, the Court held that a conspiracy charge had to fall with other counts since it was bottomed solely on allegations of invasion of the excise and occupational taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.967" offset="1091271">The courts words, the conspiracy raise “Questions identical with those presented by the substitutes counts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="255.812" offset="1126588">In contrast to Grosso, the false statement counts are not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.546" offset="1149576">They are not even similar to the charges of failure to file a wagering tax return or pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.187" offset="1176116">While we no longer contest that privilege against self-incrimination as an appropriate defense to one charged with failure to file, we don't believe that that privilege protects an independent act of making a false statement on a form which the appellee did in fact filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.088" offset="1247692">In order words, the problem of incrimination arises at the threshold when one decides whether or not to file and face -- if he files perhaps, he might face prosecution under some state gambling laws or if he fails to file prosecution under a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.262" offset="1328462">The appellee here resolved this question of whether to stand on his privilege or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.574" offset="1361690">He didn't avail himself of the what we believe to be the customary means by which statutes are challenged by non compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.651" offset="1397948">Instead, he purported to comply and in this purported compliance, he lied.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.053" offset="1423548">He is now charged with a substantive offense of making false statements in violation of a statute having no connection with the wagering tax laws except insofar as the tax laws form that framework within which the appellee committed violations of this wholly distinct criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.958" offset="1503169">Thus in our view, the Fifth Amended privilege should not control the outcome of the case in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.077" offset="1531695">Our stand is not novel by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.169" offset="1544025">A number of cases decided in the previous case argued here beginning with Kapp and Kay also cited in our brief have been controlled by a rational similar to the one we urge here.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.205" offset="1744227">Except insofar as Dennis had been decided and I assume that the Court was aware of the holding in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.993" offset="1775365">Moreover, certainly the same principles of Dennis had been used and applied in Kapp and Kay insofar as this situation is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.895" offset="1839000">These cases holding that the uncons -- the claim of unconstitutionality of the underlying statute doesn't excuse a calculated, deliberate course of perjury or fraud or deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.846" offset="1890722">In this case by the way of course, we are not dealing with the claim that the underlying statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.971" offset="1919248">We're only dealing with a privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.423" offset="1941086">You could properly assert this privilege if the lawful process, time tested process of raising it when he fails to comply and that defense is all that Marchetti and Grosso established.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.062" offset="2007646">But if an underlying statute can't be attacked on constitutional grounds, certainly, an individual shouldn't be heard to raise a constitutional privilege in a situation where he purported to comply with the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.545" offset="9521507">On page 10 under Section 3, page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.606" offset="9545749">The Internal Revenue [Inaudible] was forbidden by the constitution to require this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.206" offset="9592247">Now, the Fifth Amendment was forbidden as you have held in Grosso and Marchetti.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.691" offset="9614085">Consequently, those cases are Christopher versus United States, Baird versus United States, George versus United States are applicable because if they had no constitutional authority to require the information that's stronger, then, if they had no statutory authority to require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.688" offset="9698095">At one time had a purported statutory authority to do require it, but this Court has said, the constitutional overrode that and took away that jurisdiction from them and it's settled law by this Court under those circumstances that where like in the Christopher case where there was not a forum at the time a man gave false testimony before constitutional -- I mean before a congressional committee when there was not a forum co-existing at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.705" offset="9818154">They said, false statements made there cannot be the basis of perjury and we submit to that where that the situation here where the constitution forbade the Internal Revenue Service to get this information that they had no authority to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.293" offset="9884505">Just like in Christopher, the congressional committee at that particular time when there was no forum present had no authority to get the information, that there can be no basis on those circumstances of a charge of perjury of false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.030" offset="9959528">Unless this Court has another question I submit that's -- I believe my time is about up in there.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mervyn Hamburg</label>
            <text syncTime="2480.235" offset="10024312">I'll be very brief Your Honor because most of the matters which been raised here are replied to in our reply brief, particularly, the question of the constitutional nature of the wagering tax laws as the Marchetti and Grosso decisions themselves expressly state the wagering tax laws have not been held to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.901" offset="10130996">And therefore, there is still authority in the Government to require individuals to submit wagering tax returns admittedly if they will incriminate the individual, they may respond to this requirement by not complying and by -- thereby if prosecuted raising the privilege against self-incrimination, but he has no constitutional license to lie if he purportedly complies with the wagering tax scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.563" offset="10277595">The counsel has mentioned something about differentiation here between this case in Dennis on a matter of this defendant not receiving any benefits from wagering tax scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.409" offset="10329004">We submit that first of all benefits – receipt of benefits is not an element of the False Statements Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.832" offset="10362650">It has been since 1934 when the present wording was adopted and secondly that we perceive some benefit to be derived by under stating the number of employees one has in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.206" offset="10428165">And finally, we submit too that requiring returns is a definite function of the Internal Revenue Service -- a number of returns are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.890" offset="10486888">This one is required by particular statute which gives the Internal Revenue Service jurisdiction to require this particular return and once again, or whether or not this it so, the statute now before this Court is the false statement statute, and whether this individual should be prosecuted under the false statement statute.</text>
