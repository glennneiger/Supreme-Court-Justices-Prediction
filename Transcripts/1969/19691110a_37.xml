            <label>Mr. Irving Achtenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="24.924" offset="203107">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.985" offset="215333">This is a voting rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.042" offset="227558">This case originated in the trial court in Missouri by a petition filed by residents in a junior college district to a state junior college district in two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.003" offset="279385">The first count, the plaintiffs sought to question the right of the trustees of the junior college to locate a college site in a suburban area rather than locating it closer to the center of population of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.421" offset="357021">In the second count and the only count which is before this Court, the plaintiffs raised the question of the constitutional permissibility of the Missouri statutory formula for selection of junior college trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.524" offset="421491">The trial court dismissed most counts for failure to state a cause of action; plaintiffs dismissed their count with regard to site location and took the appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court on the constitutional question raised as to trustee selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.711" offset="490245">The Missouri Supreme Court sustained the trial court citing the Sailors case of this Court as support for its position in distinguishing the case from the Avery case decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.963" offset="555238">The plaintiffs have appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.823" offset="570702">The issue is a relatively simple one and it is thus the “one man, one vote” doctrine an application of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevent or is it violated by the Missouri peculiar statutory provision for the selection of state junior college trustees from election districts within the junior college district.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.388" offset="676968">If I may, I think the issue might be broken into two sub-issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.532" offset="697448">First of all, does the “one man, one vote” doctrine apply to school districts such as the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.611" offset="725765">Secondly, if as the appellants met the doctrine does apply, then thus the Missouri statutory provision constitute invidious discrimination and is it violative of the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.217" offset="788250">The appellants believe that that -- believe that the doctrine does apply and we believe that the Missouri statutory provisions not only permit but in fact compel by statutory formula that there'd be invidious discrimination by residents of voters and that that discrimination is directed in only one direction and favors the suburban or the small component school district voters as against the voters in the large central city district.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.466" offset="925236">The facts are presented or rather the facts present the issue with almost (Inaudible) simplicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.548" offset="953553">Under Missouri statutes, a junior college district may be formed by the voters of a group of adjacent school districts simply by their majority vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.271" offset="1008410">They may form a junior college, a state junior college district which then has as its boundaries the outer boundaries of the component school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.130" offset="1063894">Now at this point, the school districts as such cease to have any role to play in the functioning of the junior college district.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.273" offset="1104436">By the formula, they simply become election districts thereafter for the election of junior college districts and of course the junior college boundaries are co-terminus with the boundaries of the school districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.037" offset="2683486">But in any event, the statute does provide that where that -- first of all, the general provision is that election of junior college trustee shall be at large with the exception however that if in that junior college district there is what we would call a component school district having a school enumeration of more than one third or less than 50% of the total school enumeration of the junior college district, then the voters of that component school district shall have one third.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.976" offset="2827264">And since there are six trustees provided by law, they will have two of the six trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.392" offset="2856939">And in any district where a component school district has half to two-thirds of the enumeration of the total district, then the voters of that district shall vote for three of the six trustees and in the third bracket to the formula if any component school district has from two-thirds upwards of the entire junior college district then it shall have two-thirds or four.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.878" offset="2974908">Now, in each case, the remainder of the trustees are not elected by the other component school district but by what I would call an election district formed of all the remaining school districts within the junior college district.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.493" offset="3049305">So what we have is that the large district traditionally and in fact normally the central city district becomes one election district and the grouping of the small satellite or suburban school districts become another election district whether they be more or less in fact than the total of the central school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.208" offset="3168214">Now, of course the central district would have only a third so that although the formula by automatic effect is weighted in favor of the suburban districts, you could have a situation where the suburban districts actually have a greater majority of the total school situation or the school enumeration than the central city district.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.474" offset="3265285">As you make it clear that this is not a question of a limited vote, all voters throughout the entire district vote and the school boards themselves have no role whatsoever to play once the district is formed in the operation or the functioning of the junior college district.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.948" offset="3347205">Now, how does it work in practice?</text>
            <text syncTime="813.303" offset="3356609">As we have set out in our briefs and in the appendix, since this formation the Kansas City School District has had from 59 and a half to 63 and a half percent of the total enumeration of the junior college district of greater Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.090" offset="3427767">And yet during that period by the formula, it has always had only half or three of the six trustees.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.230" offset="3712293">And it's the process in at large election by which different groups are represented and I could illustrate that very easily in Kansas City where our city council is elected in part at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.610" offset="3765791">The Negro population of Kansas City which is far less than half has one Negro Councilman at large not because of their power of their vote as a majority but because as a minority, they can exercise a voice which is heard in the combined elective process.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.383" offset="3844890">I think the same process would work here.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.374" offset="3856906">However, we are not I -- and this Court is not committed to telling the State of Missouri that it must leave the statute so that these trustees are elected at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.939" offset="3903091">The legislature of Missouri has the right to rewrite this law and to set up election districts and there are certainly arguments for election districts so that if there are area of view points so as view points may be represented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.653" offset="4253968">We say simply that if the Court proceeds on the premise which we've believed to be a fact that school enumeration is proportionate, then we are simply establishing a formula for population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.251" offset="4312377">And then the discriminatory formula of the bracketing moving in one direction makes it an improper population formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.161" offset="4351979">On the other hand, if the appellees argue that enumeration is not proportionate to population and there is no evidence in the record to support any such position, but if they are to argue that this is a different method of calculation then its our position that there is no -- first of all, that this is not the special group that votes, the six to 20 year old is not a limited electorate such as was considered by this Court in the Kramer, the entire population votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.129" offset="4479875">It simply would then be an argument that that area which has a different ratio of six to 20 year olds, all the voters in that area should have a specially weighted vote and we argue that this would be a violation of the “one man, one vote” doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.388" offset="4556884">I would like to say expanding the facts in Missouri beyond the Kansas City School, the Junior College District that the same thing has happened throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.590" offset="4597739">There are nine state junior college districts, three of them do not have any district in which the fraction of formula applies so their trustees are elected at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.916" offset="4643088">And the remaining six districts where the situation does pertain, we find that in five of the six, the discriminatory formula has operated so that in the statistics in our brief, we show that in five out of the six, the discrimination proceeds to the cause, to the extreme range of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.428" offset="4745070">So that what we have is that in five out of the six, the weighting of the vote is from one and a half to one to two to one against the large component school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.024" offset="4811421">Now, I'd like to summarize very quickly the functions of a junior college under Missouri law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.623" offset="6761827">Now I see great differences between a County Board of Education where there are -- the local area school boards or boards of education and the situation here, the County Boards of Educations or a rather atrophied in -- and the vestigial type of a Governmental agency in many cases they are being abolished.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.236" offset="7248332">The appellees speak of school districts in the context of special districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.978" offset="7279261">We submit that that language is a little meaningless and in any event a school district is much closer to a city council or a county government than to the traditional concept of a special district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.753" offset="7338402">I would prefer to call them special youth districts, special assessment districts or special benefit districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.368" offset="7368808">They have normally three characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.471" offset="7381243">First of all, they specifically affect one area of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.495" offset="7409351">The water district, the sewer district, the levy district affects the property owners directly who are protected by that improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.004" offset="7451355">Secondly, normally the assessment, the taxing for that improvement is against that special benefited group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.886" offset="7486882">And thirdly, it is common for that specially benefited and specially taxed group to have the right to be the special electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.247" offset="7524394">Now, not one of these criteria exists in terms of a school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.285" offset="7544560">Under the decisions of this Court in our traditional concepts of the American public school system, all the people of the community are benefited by the existence of public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.057" offset="7595551">Second of all, by Missouri law, all the citizens of the community are taxed for the schools either by the real property tax or through the personal property tax or to some extent by the state income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.536" offset="7653543">And thirdly, we have a general electorate, so that none of the criteria of the special district apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.390" offset="7684890">In terms of function, I think it equally significant that we are not talking about the narrow function of a special youth district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.549" offset="7725537">The sewer district, you run a sewer, the water district, you want to walk or you run a water line, it's a one step operation and from then on, the function of that board whether it be elected or appointed is simply a minor matter of collection of angular assessments and maintenance of the improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.874" offset="7798888">This is a far cry from the complex problems presented in the context of the day's educational problems by our school systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="3774.602" offset="15201782">I would direct my remarks to two factors, one, the justification for the component district system of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.948" offset="15235114">And secondly, that the junior college district that we are dealing with here is not a general governing body in the sense that it's discussed in Avery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.454" offset="15273148">First of all, the legislative officers as I see them in electing trustees of this junior college district are three, possibly four as an alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.354" offset="15312750">One, they could be elected at large, two, they could be elected from equal arbitrarily drawn election districts and three, they can be elected from the component public school districts as in fact as the statute here.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3815.241" offset="15364368">If they were elected at large, they are -- the first to be all was the risk that they'd all be elected from one end of the areas, is it not possible?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_c_defeo_jr" startTime="3823.508" stopTime="4311.305">
            <label>Mr. Louis C. Defeo, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3823.508" offset="15397386">Yes and in particular this question was brought out earlier and the counsel for the appellant said that there were a slight chance of this happening in fact but I know in Kansas City public school district, where directors were formerly elected at large that it is either four of the six or five of the six who come from the same high school attendants area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.956" offset="15487248">So this is what would happen we feel at an at large election which justifies the legislature and not using the at large method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.822" offset="15534686">Further, I think the at large method although if you can mathematically say one man's vote is equal to another dilutes minority's effectiveness in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.512" offset="15585468">This is true of the Negro population, the rural population and may be the inner city population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.607" offset="15609814">They could not in many cases as a practical matter elect a trustee who represented their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.721" offset="15642206">Even where there is a residence qualification, is off times the case that the persons elected are favorable to the majority grouping although they physically reside in one other -- in another area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.283" offset="15708453">I think that some distinction between the junior college district and public school districts in general must be made at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.125" offset="15743875">Junior college -- public school districts directors have always been elected at large in Missouri with one exception that was recently made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.180" offset="15776057">In comparison junior college district directors are elected from component school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.822" offset="15806673">Furthermore which is even more critical, there is an overlapping of jurisdictions, I like to refer this to this as a federation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.629" offset="15833840">A junior college district is a federation, that's not strictly true but I think it reflects the essence of component public school districts joined together in forming a junior college district which has taken over a particular function that was formally operated by the public school district that is of 13th and 14th year of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.581" offset="15925687">I think the component system is justified by the history of junior college education in Missouri which has been touched on already here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.065" offset="15959646">It is formally -- this was handled by each public school district itself and they have given up a part of their function to chart it over to the junior college district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.745" offset="16002382">Moreover they may, even under present laws still continue to operate junior colleges each public school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.919" offset="16031013">Furthermore the method of organization manifest this federation, this simply was already been discussed adequately and I'll pass on to the next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.313" offset="16072600">The system of component districts also promotes organization and I think this is probably one of the most important things as reflected by the statistics that Mr. Burrell cited that enrollment has gone from 6 to about 30,000 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.602" offset="16141772">The curriculum offerings, I don't have any statistics but I know from representing the State Board of Education have developed greatly by this method of providing junior college education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.101" offset="16191822">Next, I would like to point as a justification for the component district system that the component school district is an established community of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.776" offset="16234454">It is not an arbitrary election district or that it is setup only for the purpose of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.930" offset="16259114">The component school district is a public school district that educates children from 5 years to 16 years, from kindergarten through senior year of high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.533" offset="16297462">The people in that district are accustomed to joining in a concern for education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.345" offset="16320763">They are concerned about their high school graduates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.338" offset="16332675">They have developed communication channels for the purpose of providing education in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.227" offset="16364231">Therefore it is almost a natural society, a natural unit to be represented in the junior college district and under the present method they can elect a trustee that reflects this community of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.209" offset="16432253">Furthermore, the component school district system facilitates the administration of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.130" offset="16471855">School district boundary lines change very rapidly, much more rapidly than municipality boundary lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.462" offset="16501217">School districts can change their boundaries in Missouri by annexation, by consolidation, by boundary change elections by reorganization and this occur almost daily throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.031" offset="16551476">Under the present component district system, the boundaries of the school district and this component districts change simultaneously, they are always coincident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.277" offset="16600482">Furthermore there is economics and facility administration in holding elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.517" offset="16625455">Under the present component district system, junior college district trustees are elected at the same time as public school trustees, the component district trustees thus you avoid the necessity of two elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.679" offset="16674043">Now, if we had equally divided election districts rather than components, it would be necessary in many years to have separate elections for trustees because there's a difference between the time of election of different component school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.152" offset="16748022">Furthermore, since both of these agencies, the component and the junior college are supervised by the State Board of Education in curriculum and other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.837" offset="16782712">This facilitates the State Administration of Education in preserving the component district system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.504" offset="16809357">I think also the component district system is valuable because these trustees directly responsible to a smaller area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.747" offset="16850317">It is the decentralization argument that is presented to you in the amicus brief of the Attorney General of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.791" offset="16874559">Also, it facilitates the urban, suburban, rural alliance which has already been discussed I believe in length here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.623" offset="16905906">I would like to move to my second point that is, that a junior college district, what we are talking about here is not a general governing body as is discussed in the Avery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.856" offset="16958777">Counties, cities which have been held under the equal protection, one man, one vote rule, -- excuse me, have quasi sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.321" offset="17000678">They have clearly identifiable units which reflect the three branches of our Angle-Saxon government, executive, legislative and judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.916" offset="17035055">They make laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.756" offset="17038399">They enforce laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.958" offset="17043205">They adjudicate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.799" offset="17050520">Furthermore, and I think is very critical here, general governing bodies, cities and counties have the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.022" offset="17075493">They license professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.471" offset="17081240">They regulate businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.298" offset="17088554">They provide for the safety of the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.796" offset="17098585">They provide for general health.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.562" offset="17105586">They provide for general welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.741" offset="17114363">They also provide numerous common services like police protection and fire protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.341" offset="17136724">None of these things does the junior college, the District of Metropolitan, Kansas City did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.480" offset="17157308">They're in business for one purpose and there is education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.407" offset="17176952">I think the junior college district of Kansas City is much more comparable to a private incorporated college than it is to a general governing body.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.021" offset="17211434">If we look at the enumerated powers that Mr. Achtenberg mentioned to the court earlier, the junior college district can sue so can a private college.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.629" offset="17245915">The junior college district can issue bonds, so can a private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.579" offset="17261693">The junior college districts employs these teachers and other persons, so does a private college.</text>

            <text syncTime="4390.725" offset="17666278">Originally when they organize, the voters authorize ten cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.287" offset="17680488">Now, if they want to exceed that, they have to hold an election, the Missouri constitution provides that you -- if you get a certain percentage of the vote, its good for up to I think four years if you just get a -- simple majority is only good for one year so you have to go back every year for an additional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.611" offset="17745795">I would further add that a private college has almost the same powers and that they are often -- receive the benefit of federal lands, state -- governmental moneys through assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.779" offset="17786441">And the only other power that I can find that is somewhat different is that a junior college district can condemn property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.275" offset="17812459">But this is true also of many quasi public corporations, public utilities, railroads, telephone companies, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.206" offset="17848195">So, basically I find the junior college district much more akin to a private incorporated college than it is to a city or county or other generally -- general governing body.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.423" offset="17897096">Therefore, I would conclude to say that the one man, one vote rule should not be extended to include this junior college district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.054" offset="17935548">That it is not a general governing body as the term has been -- as I understand the term as expressed in the court's present opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.218" offset="17964283">But further that Missouri and other states should have the flexibility to innovate, to experiment, to find methods of education that are tailored to the local need in the local circumstances and this is what the component system is.</text>

            <text syncTime="4534.161" offset="18240031">The statutory formula with which we are dealing in effect guarantees the small component district voters, a weighted vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.152" offset="18284022">The only situation, purely theoretical in which the vote would be equal would be if the large component school district has exactly one third or exactly 50% or exactly two thirds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.811" offset="18346611">The minute its -- it falls to one side or the other of that exact one vote, it then becomes a prejudicial formula which moves in the direction of prejudice of the large component school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.824" offset="18414634">Because you start with the third and if you have exactly a third, you get one third of the votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.893" offset="18434905">You're from one third to a half, you still get a third.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.633" offset="18449951">You must proceed to the exactitude of a half to get what you're entitled to as half.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.658" offset="18470013">And the minute you pass over that then you become -- again discriminated against until you reach the exact mathematical point of two thirds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.483" offset="18513272">Now, no place in the evidence and no place in the arguments is any rational distinction given for the need to have such a weighted voting formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.248" offset="18564368">The argument is made and it was heard before in the legislative redistricting cases that the -- in that case, it was the rural minority, in this case, it's the suburban minority needs protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.166" offset="18624031">What we think should be said is that all minorities need to have a vote in proportion to their voting strength and we say that this formula denies that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.150" offset="18668022">It favors one group whether it be a minority or in some situations a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.313" offset="18692577">It gives that one group a vote weighted against its actual population strength.</text>

            <text syncTime="4717.230" offset="18972296">Well, I'm simply giving several alternatives with the emotions developed in school district problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.251" offset="19008345">I think -- if we're thinking of wisdom whether than -- rather than constitutionality that perhaps either the district selection from equal population districts or the Davis versus Dusch formula would be more responsive to the wishes or to -- would more clearly express the wishes of people in terms of school problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.161" offset="19104057">I think it should be clear that there are two issues not presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.019" offset="19119417">We're not talking about whether or not this board may be appointive or elective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.705" offset="19138226">The statute and the legislature have decided that this is a governmental body affecting the public interest to the point they felt it should be an elective board.</text>

            <text syncTime="4771.356" offset="19188799">Secondly, we don't have the question of a limited electorate as there was in Kramer because here, again the legislature saw fit to have a vote by all qualified voters in the entire district.</text>

            <text syncTime="4801.994" offset="19311365">That's correct, simply by petition without a party identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.810" offset="19334562">I'd like to conclude with our thinking in terms of the importance of schools and in that context, the junior college has the same powers as any public school in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.814" offset="19394644">It has three campuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.887" offset="19406869">It has all the myriad problems confronting schools today and I submit that schools involve more tensions, more strife and more controversy than the county court involved in Avery versus Midland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.922" offset="19471026">The statistics obligingly furnished by the Solicitor General and his brief in this case indicate that the school boards are the most numerous of all forms of local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.945" offset="19519195">They're over 21,000 school districts in this country and they constitute over one fourth of all local governmental units and about 10% of those elect from districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.087" offset="19571754">About one half of all local governmental expenditures go for education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.968" offset="19599235">Now, these are quantitative figures but it seems to me that in the qualitative aspect, the qualitative impact of school operations, of public school operations on our governmental concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.543" offset="19661511">And in that respect that the concerns of citizens for the functioning of their schools is clearly a matter of governmental concern in which each voters rights should be weighed as every other voters.</text>
