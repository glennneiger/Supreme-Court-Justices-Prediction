            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="36.587" offset="249710">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.062" offset="263607">Presented for decision in this case is the constitutionality of certain aspects of Arizona's Fruit and Vegetable Standardization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.452" offset="293177">Once again, we have a very important industry and a very important statute of an important agricultural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.684" offset="318151">I believe that the issues which are present in this case can best be appreciated against the background on a brief discussion of the nature and purpose of Arizona's Fruit and Vegetable Standardization Act and the history of Standardization Act in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.935" offset="379068">Mr. Justice Brandeis reminds us in Pacific States Box &amp; Basket case which is cited in our brief that Standardization Act, that is acts which prescribe standards for certain types of containers of agricultural produced are among the earliest examples of the exercise of police power by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.645" offset="473945">The case that Mr. Justice Brandeis' cites as authority for that proposition is Turner versus Maryland an 1883 unanimous decision by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.119" offset="523891">There is some language in Turner versus Maryland which is not cited in our brief, but which I believe definitely warrants the attention of the Court because it answers specifically one of the propositions or one of the contentions that's raised by the appellee in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.069" offset="591600">Citation of Turner versus Maryland is contained in our brief, it's 107 U.S. 38 and this particular quote appears at page 57.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.826" offset="638725">In that case, this Court ruled as follows: “the state may direct that a certain product while it remains in the bosom of the country and before it becomes an article of foreign commerce or commerce between the states, shall be encased, shall be encased in such a package as appears best fit it to secure the safety of the package and to identify its contents as the growth of the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="165.154" offset="764008">So that as early as 1883, this Court in the unanimous decision required that it lay within the police powers of the state, to require that the produce of that state prior to the time that it leaves the state, be encased in a certain type of package, and that that package identify the produce as the product of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.757" offset="842376">Involved in that particular case was a standard container known as the hogshead or Maryland tobacco, and that statute required that the hogshead identify the tobacco contained therein is Maryland tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.005" offset="899427">The Arizona Fruit and Vegetable Standardization Act rests upon consideration similar to those which are approved by this Court in Turner versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.501" offset="937357">The record in this case contains a discussion of the conditions which led up to the enactment of the Standardization Act, and they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.821" offset="978631">Prior to 1929 when the Act was adopted, it was up to each individual shipper within the state to set his own standards, both for the quality of the produce that he desired to ship, and the type of container that he desired to ship it in if he shipped it in a container at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.142" offset="1047907">Consequently, the standards adopted by some shippers were very high, and the standards adopted by other shippers were not so high.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.011" offset="1083434">It is abundantly borne out by this record that it is of prime importance to the success of marketing of fruits and vegetables that the shipper maintained a good reputation for shipping quality of fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.117" offset="1135888">But the record also bears out, there's not always possible to maintain that reputation separate and apart from the reputation of the district or the state within which he produces and from which he ships his product, particularly where it's produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.414" offset="1200985">Conversely stated if a state can acquire a good reputation for a certain type of produce, that reputation will inure to the benefit not only of the state as a whole, but also each individual grower and shipper within that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.353" offset="1272769">And it is not difficult to find examples where a states have been successful in creating such reputation, such as Washington apples, Florida oranges, Arizona grapefruit and frankly we believe Arizona cantaloupes.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.760" offset="1334418">This then was the problem for it which the Fruit and Vegetable Standardization Act was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.147" offset="1351973">It set minimum standards for a selected number of fruits and vegetables, now 37 within the State of Arizona and those standards have been met by all shippers where the Act so provided and it also provided that they have to meet minimum standards not only of quality, but also a pack, and that it had to be packed in standard containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.709" offset="1442252">The provisions dealing with cantaloupes as they appear in the statute today are illustrative in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.631" offset="1473912">As set forth in the statute and the statute is cited, the relevant provisions are cited at the outset of our brief, the cantaloupes must be mature, but not overripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.541" offset="1517484">They have to be free from mold, decays, sponginess, welding, insect damage and a variety of quality defects, but perhaps the most interesting provisions of the statute from the standpoint of this case are those provisions which deal with the individual pack and the appearance of the cantaloupes within that pack.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.863" offset="1602853">It's been stipulated by the parties that a prime purpose of the statute was to avoid deceptive packs or a deceptive arrangement, deceptive arrangement and deceptive pack are described similarly by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.311" offset="1652590">They pertain to that situation wherein the higher quality fruit is placed toward the outside of the container with the off quality fruit in the center of the container of the lesser quality fruit in the center cover, so as to materially misrepresent the quality of the entire container.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.484" offset="1725315">That particular provision of course can only be enforced if the container itself after it has been packed, has been inspected, and there are other provisions as to which this is also true.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.111" offset="1771813">Well Mr. Lee, what's -- tell me, you cited some prior case, but what would you suppose the justification is for states saying you may not ship in bulk out of the state?</text>

            <text syncTime="611.037" offset="2547545">They are inspected, but they are inspected only for the purpose of determining the presence of pickle worm, which is a quality defect of cantaloupes.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.782" offset="2634480">And from that point, provided that they meet the test, they go right on through the inspection station, presumably on their way to Blight to be packed.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.436" offset="3621073">Let's assume that the standards were exactly the same today?</text>

            <text syncTime="908.788" offset="3738520">At all points, the conclusion is simply inevitable that starting from the premise which we feel is justified as set forth by this Court in Turner versus Maryland, Sligh versus Kirkwood and the Pacific States case that we do have the right to prescribe the standard containers, and we have the right to enforce it through our own inspection officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.809" offset="3862653">Even assuming that that is correct, if this appellee allowed to ship them across the state line in violation of the statute, we're going to have to let others and we have no control over how those will be sold or whether they will be packed in standard containers at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.725" offset="3926288">The only way that we can assure that is to assure -- is to require that before the produce leaves the state, it is packed neatly in a new clean container, arranged orderly, uniform in size, uniform in color, uniform in variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.063" offset="3987623">So that when the grocer opens that box, he knows that he can take the cantaloupes out of their box, put them on the shelf and they will make a nice, neat, attractive assortment, uniform in color, uniform in size, and up to quality that is guaranteed by the Arizona Standardization Act, and that is what is meant by standardization, and that's what we're trying to preserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.179" offset="5300120">But these three cases, I submit to the Court clearly established the legitimate interest of the state, and that's all we have to show is that the state does have, the legitimate interest in preserving the reputation of its fruits and vegetables by setting these standards of quality and of pack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.043" offset="5371591">Now, the real issue in the case, the dispositive issue in the case is this, it rises in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.636" offset="5409938">The appellee as I read his brief agrees, demand on certain circumstances be a legitimate interest enforcing standardization, but he says that there is a qualifying consideration in this case because in the context of cantaloupes; they can't be packed except in a packing shed and we agree that under present technology, they can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.504" offset="5497396">Therefore, in the appellee's view, this case comes within those decisions of this Court which have said that where it is the sole objective of the statute to require packing to be accomplished in the state that renders the statute unconstitutional, [Inaudible] Polar Ice Cream versus Andrews and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.401" offset="5572942">And the appellee takes one more step as indeed he must, and that is to say that the purpose of the Arizona statute is the same and that is to preserve the packing business for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.098" offset="5627800">So that really, the ultimate issue, the dispositive issue between these two parties is what is the purpose of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.801" offset="5662595">Is it the statute, is it the purpose which has been testified to on this record?</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.519" offset="5681403">Is it the purpose that is set forth in the preamble of the statute itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.886" offset="5698957">Is it the purpose that is been upheld by this Court in Sligh versus Kirkwood, Pacific States and Turner versus Maryland, or is it a purpose which will make it invalid?</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.776" offset="5742425">Once the case is viewed in that fashion, I submit to this Court that the answer is very clear, because this Court has made it clear in a number of cases that it will not re-examine the wisdom of the state legislative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.960" offset="5807208">And that so long as there is a proper purpose that this purpose will be assumed to be the purpose on which the state legislature rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.305" offset="5856632">I need not recant those cases at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.809" offset="5874604">They're set forth in our brief, and I believe that they adequately dispose of this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.098" offset="5899786">Unless the Court has any further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.114" offset="6127783">I understood he had two barrels to his gun: One, to get credit for the good and to avoid the disadvantages of being credited with the bad if somebody sold bad fruit as Arizona fruit?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jacob Abramson</label>
            <text syncTime="1525.471" offset="6205210">Mr. Chief Justice, the argument of appellant is that Parker fruit is good fruit and he wants it to be labeled as good fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.527" offset="6277517">This is the main concern and his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.561" offset="6289638">He states this repeatedly that it's to enhance the reputation by identifying the fruit as Arizona fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.123" offset="6343868">The point I'm getting to is that the determining question here is not what is the purpose of the Arizona law, even if the purpose is to obtain credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.984" offset="6395277">Although, this Court has never gone so far as to permit what the appellant seeks to do here in furtherance of that purpose, even to achieve credit we say is not an improper purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.264" offset="6460479">It's fine we say if one wants to do a good job and to get credit for it, but that is not the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.091" offset="6483780">The issue before this Court is how far may the State of Arizona go in trying to achieve this purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.807" offset="6526621">In order to achieve this purpose, the State of Arizona through the interpretation of the Arizona law by the appellant is saying three things must occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.642" offset="6569984">One, the packing must be done in Arizona; Two, the packing must be done in packing shed in Arizona and in the context of this case where the Church Company does not have packing facilities at Parker and indeed, cannot have such facility because there are no railroad lines going in there, must construct packing facilities at Parker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.524" offset="6677504">To be sure appellant states, now the law doesn't in terms say you must do this and therefore, we can't hear you to complain, but this is the necessary effect of his order and in fact, the appellant in its brief expressly states this that this is the dilemma in which the appellee finds itself that in order to comply with the order, it must do these three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.682" offset="6798085">Now, we submit that this goes too far in its encroachment upon the federal concern with maintaining a free-flow of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.618" offset="6845837">We submit it's contrary to decisions of this Court which we have cited; the Shrimp cases to which learned counsel has alluded to in his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.993" offset="6895365">We submit that this is the real issue; how far may the State of Arizona go in obtaining credit for a good fruit or even keeping out poor fruit?</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.067" offset="6951685">There has been no case cited by appellant in which this Court has gone so far as to say that these three requirements maybe imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.781" offset="7378526">If Oregon statute said raspberries and strawberries must be packed in Oregon, this would have presented before this Court the same issue which it has before it now.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.474" offset="7701295">Counsel for Western Growers has stated with reference to that case that it's cited a long string of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.088" offset="7739747">These were statutes in a colonial times, much has happened since 1882, advancements in transportation, processing, packing, handling, and of course this Court since that time has rendered decisions in the Toomer v. Witsell, the Heidell cases, the Dean Milk case, and I think we're moving with the times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.305" offset="7832639">This Court has stated on numerous occasions that it will be guarded by practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.462" offset="7857194">Mr. Justice White has already touched upon one point that I would like to make, namely that the problem which brings us before this Court is one which exists in the border districts which joined the states of California and Arizona; that is to say the districts along the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.532" offset="7957504">Here, the same climatic conditions prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.306" offset="7972551">Climate, weather atmospheric conditions know no state borders, and that given the same growing conditions, it is not uncommon for the same grower to have growing operations on both sides of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.393" offset="8040991">Now, the question was raised; what is the area of production?</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.240" offset="8060322">It's not too great Mr. Justice White because the crops which are involved are of such a highly perishable nature that they must be taken out of the ground, processed, packed and put in cars on their way within the matter of just a few hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.501" offset="8137331">So, the distance does not -- you're not -- you don't have the possibility of dealing in large distances, I would say a radius of 30 miles, 40 miles, something of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.351" offset="8192815">The Church Company the appellee here has operations on both sides as you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.933" offset="8223117">It has operations at Parker under a lease with the Colorado River, Indian Tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.815" offset="8250598">This is a distance of 25 miles from the border and has been doing its packing at Blight on the California side, 5 miles over on the California side.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.166" offset="8300022">Yes, on the Blight side and because these are growers who don't enjoy federal subsidies, whose production cost and transportation and costs are among the highest in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.275" offset="8352475">Their success or failure depends on their ability to be efficient, and this means to economize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.938" offset="8375150">So, if a grower of this kind requires packing facilities, he will put them on one side of the line or the other wherever they fit in with his operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.699" offset="8422170">He's obviously not going to duplicate his facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.927" offset="8435127">Now, the same situation exists at Yuma on the Arizona side and at Bard on the California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.058" offset="8479640">These are just opposite to one another, across the river, the short distance of possibly 5 miles and for years, there has been transport of cantaloupes and other commodities from the California side at Bard over to Yuma on the Arizona side where they been processed and packed just as these cantaloupes had been at Blight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.297" offset="8584547">California as you know has a law very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.703" offset="8598235">We can draw fine lines about particular words or sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.713" offset="8618193">But basically, they're the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.774" offset="8626448">There's testimony in the record that the California law and inspection, if anything is more stringent than the Arizona law, but we need not to make an issue of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.444" offset="8673155">In any event, it's been going on from Bard to Yuma for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.716" offset="8694262">California has never raised the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.034" offset="10691480">Significant contention raised by Mr. Abramson, and this of course is been at the heart of disposition throughout this entire litigation, is that the purpose of this statute is to require the packing be done in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.027" offset="10743515">We simply assert that is not the purpose and under the well established rules of statutory construction in constitutional cases is set forth on page 34 to 39 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.744" offset="10786356">Court simply don't ascribe improper purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.943" offset="10799104">The statute nowhere says anything about a packing shed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.497" offset="10813315">I would point to the Court that this statute deals with 37 different products; 37 different products, only one of which is cantaloupes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.077" offset="10847692">Most of them don't have to be packed in the packing shed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.722" offset="10858245">Most of them can be packed in the field, and we can inspect them there, and that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.671" offset="10878098">The concern of the statute is not the packing be done in the state, the concern of the statute is that we be able to inspect it in the pack in order to determine that the statutory standards --</text>

            <text syncTime="2714.939" offset="10963153">So the question is, where does it fall?</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.596" offset="10973706">Is it the Sligh versus Kirkwood, Turner versus Maryland case, or is it a Heidell case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.488" offset="10989275">And I would simply point out that in Heidell, this Court concluded that there was no other possible reasons for the requirement that -- a packing within the state other than the sole requirement that they wanted to keep the packing business for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.707" offset="11058239">Were that the case in this statute, it would be made applicable to lettuce, it would be made applicable to asparagus, it would be made applicable to colliflower and the whole gamut products, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.327" offset="11100662">There is no requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.453" offset="11109230">The only reason that they have to pack in the state is because they -- that they have to build a packing shed is that they cannot pack except in the packing shed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.069" offset="11143607">So far as we are concerned, if they want to pack underneath the shade tree, that's fine, we can then carry out the inspection responsibilities with which Mr. Pike is charged under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.378" offset="11188851">Now, with regard to Sligh versus Kirkwood, I simply thoroughly disagree that that was a -- a health and safety measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.827" offset="11222706">I need not re-read the language that the Chief Justice has read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.625" offset="11241827">That language is significant to two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.021" offset="11251440">First of all, it points out that it is a proper purpose to be concern with the state's reputation in interstate commerce, and secondly, it points out that as long as that could have been the legislative purpose, then the statute will be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.000" offset="11327404">Mr. Abramson as I understand his comments, agreed that Turner versus Maryland was against him, but argues that is too old and therefore, the Court ought not to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.451" offset="11381217">Mr. Justice Stewart, so that you don't think that I'm totally incompetent in having missed it the first time around, let me point out that the language that I found which thoroughly resolves this comes at the end of a very long, long opinion in order to save you the same problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.691" offset="11438164">Might I point out that is at page 57 of the United States reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.391" offset="11480900">Finally and in conclusion and I won't need to use my seven minutes, this is an economic regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.330" offset="11516740">It's a regulation imposed by a state pursuant to its police powers, and this Court has made it very clear, starting at Nebbia versus New York that there is a heavy burden which rests upon those individuals who seek to upset that police power regulation on the ground that it is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.760" offset="11598451">There is no federal statute with which this is inconsistent, certainly under this Court's decision in Paul and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.567" offset="11637635">-- before you get to your summary, has this statute involving as you suggest many other products of Arizona been challenged in the state courts at any time?</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.815" offset="11686640">Never on these grounds Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.364" offset="11692805">The – there have been probably half a dozen at the outside, pieces of litigation involving these statutes and most of them have involved bonds that the shippers had put up and -- nothing of this magnitude.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="2911.729" offset="11750275">None of the issues involved here have ever been passed upon -- have even been passed upon by a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.175" offset="11788100">It is agreed on all sides supported by the record, supported by square holdings of this Court that the State of Arizona has a legitimate interest, so long as these fruits and vegetables remain in the language of this Court within the bosom of the State of Arizona in requiring that they be packed according to the standards that the State of Arizona has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.669" offset="11878066">Once you start from that premise, it is simply inevitable that the state has the right to enforce those standards according to its own inspection officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.845" offset="11922787">The statutory standards necessarily involve manners of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.772" offset="11938461">Material misrepresentation of the entire quantity, uniformity of quality, uniformity of size, uniformity of color, these are judgment matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.547" offset="11973569">We submit that the State of Arizona has the right to have these judgment matters resolved by the judgment of its own inspection officers and not inspection officers of someone else outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.881" offset="12022888">In conclusion, when this first came up, Mr. Pike came to me and said well now, what is this law, this federal law that our law violates?</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.253" offset="12060400">And I said well Mr. Pike, it's the constitution and he said well, it's written in English isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.112" offset="12079835">Can I read it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.694" offset="12086105">And I said well Mr. Pike, the constitutions, you have to understand, have a wealth of decisions behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.881" offset="12106898">And then he said nevertheless, it's written in English, let me see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.282" offset="12120482">I showed to him and he said Congress shall have the power to regulate interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.422" offset="12137096">He said has Congress passed a law saying that we can't have a Standardization Act in Arizona?</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.211" offset="12164263">I of course, replied that Congress had not passed such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.969" offset="12183280">I think that it is important to bear in mind because I'm sure this Court well knows, in the absence of congressional legislation, the judicial function is a narrow one, and we submit that this case clearly falls within the bounds of legitimate exercise of state police power and the judgment of the lower court should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.297" offset="12256528">Thank you.</text>
