            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="13.484" offset="157341">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.921" offset="179075">This case comes here on a direct appeal from a three-judge court in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.536" offset="209481">The legal question involved is the constitutional validity of an Act of Congress relating to the citizenship of a child born abroad, one of whose parents is an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.864" offset="270817">The statutory provision in question is Sections 301(a) (7) and 301(b) of the Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.200" offset="316165">These are set forth beginning at the bottom of page 45 of the Government’s brief and continuing on to page 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.210" offset="356185">I would like to read the important portions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.714" offset="374262">Beginning at the bottom of page 45, the following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth (7).</text>
            <text syncTime="77.651" offset="413968">A person born outside the geographical limits of the United States in its outlying possession of parents, one of whom is a alien and the other, a citizen of the United States who prior to the birth of such person was physically present in the United States or its outlying possession for a period or periods totaling not less than 10 years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.681" offset="534131">And then 301(b), any person who is a national and citizen of the United States at birth under paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of this Section shall lose his nationality and citizenship unless he shall come to the United States prior to attaining the age of 23 years and shall immediately following any such coming be continuously physically present in the United States for at least five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.412" offset="653040">Provided that such physical presence follows the attainment of the age of 14 years and precedes the age of 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.378" offset="692851">And I may add that there is another statute which provides that the continuous presence is not broken by absences which do not exceed one year so that he is perfectly possible to go back for visits, but he must have five years without more than a one year break.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.665" offset="781981">The case arises on the following facts which were stipulated and thus are not the subject of any dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.545" offset="813537">The appellee, Aldo Mario Bellei was born in Italy in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.939" offset="847078">His father is an Italian, a native and citizen of Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.987" offset="867349">Aldo Mario Bellei became an Italian citizen at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.505" offset="889396">He is an Italian citizen today.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.540" offset="901517">Thus, there is no question of statelessness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.302" offset="920534">The appellee’s mother was born in the United States and has always been an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.354" offset="952822">The father and mother were married in Philadelphia on March 14, 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.546" offset="981556">A few days later, they left for Italy where the appellee was born in December 1939 and the family has since recited in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.789" offset="1030562">At the time of the appellee’s birth, an Act of 1934 was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.893" offset="1058983">This is printed on page 44 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.407" offset="1076955">It was an amendment to Section 1993 of the Revised Statutes and it provided that a child in these circumstances is declared to be a citizen of the United States, but the rights of citizenship shall not descend to any such child unless the citizen father or citizen mother as the case maybe has resided in the United States previous to the birth of such child.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.846" offset="1194715">And then it goes on to provide that where one of the parents is an alien, the right of citizenship shall not descend unless the child comes to the United States and resides therein for at least five years continuously, immediately previous state to his 18th birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.701" offset="1270157">And unless within six months after the child’s 21st birthday, he or she shall take an oath of allegiance to the United States of America as prescribed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.353" offset="1324805">That statute in 1934 was amended in 1940, liberalizing the time period and casting it and not in terms of citizenship shall not descend but in terms of a statement that he is a citizen, but that he shall lose his citizenship if the condition is not met and the time provision was further extended by the 1952 statute which is the one now in effect and before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.998" offset="1455313">Under this statute as I’ve indicated, the child born abroad with one parent or citizen may retain or perfect his citizenship by residing in the United States for five continuous years, some time between his 14th birthday and his 28th birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.283" offset="1532531">And that means that if he has not started to do that residence by his 23rd birthday, then there is no possibility if the statute is valid that he can retain his citizenship under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.775" offset="1590523">The appellee here has lived in Italy most of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.413" offset="1609017">Recently, he took up residence in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.855" offset="1622810">He has made five brief visits to the United States, but he has never established residence in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.486" offset="1657292">On his first two trips in 1948 and 1951, he traveled on his mother’s American passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.510" offset="1693445">On his next two trips in 1955 and 1962, he traveled on his own United States passport and this was periodically renewed until December 22, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.547" offset="1761573">In connection with the last two renewals of this passport, he was expressly advised of the need to establish residence in the United States prior to his 23rd birthday if he wished to retain his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.221" offset="1824266">When he failed to do so, the Department of State notified him that he had lost his United States citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.747" offset="1858330">He came there after to the United States in 1965 using an Italian passport and was admitted as an alien visitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.799" offset="1902529">That too was a temporary visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.105" offset="1915800">Two years later in 1967, the appellee brought this suit contending that the conditions for the retention of citizenship prescribed by the Immigration and Nationality Act are unconstitutional and that he has not lost his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.453" offset="1985181">When this contention was sustained by the three-judge District Court, the case was brought here for review on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.620" offset="2037844">The decision below is I think one which shows the result of an unduly conceptual approach to the problems in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.979" offset="2091238">There are indeed two absolutes which have dominated thinking in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.360" offset="2120808">One is reminded in the consideration of this problem of the reference by Judge Cardozo nearly 50 years ago in the nature of the judicial process to the tendency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of his logic or to home his references to carrying things to a dryly logical extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.051" offset="2227597">One of these absolutes is that all United States citizens are exactly alike as far as their citizenship is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.370" offset="2268871">Under this view, there can be no variations whatever in any aspect of the citizenship of a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.122" offset="2303875">A citizen is a citizen is a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.581" offset="2321742">The other absolute is that no citizen can be deprived of his citizenship except by some action which he not only takes intentionally, but takes for the very purpose of terminating his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.191" offset="2392168">It is clear I think that these absolutes find some support in the opinions of this Court in the cases of Schneider against Rusk in 377 U.S. and Afroyim against Rusk in 387 U.S. on which the court below relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.010" offset="2479417">If these propositions are truly absolutes, then this appeal must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.764" offset="2506480">My effort will be to show that this conceptual approach is not a sound one and that there is no appropriate reason to hold that citizenship cannot be qualified in certain circumstances or that citizenship maybe extended in some cases including this one in a tentative or preliminary or in court manner which will not come to full maturity if certain requirements are not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.690" offset="2650154">After all, here is a statute which is entirely fair, rational, understandable and sensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.472" offset="2693308">Why it should be thought to be unconstitutional or what provision of the constitution that violates is hard to see?</text>
            <text syncTime="658.436" offset="2737089">It is wholly clear I believe that Congress could have provided a condition preceding rather than a condition subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.102" offset="2787767">That is Congress could have provided that a child born abroad with one parent a citizen should not acquire citizenship at birth, but that he would become a citizen by coming to the United States and residing here for five years between the ages of 14 and 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.863" offset="2874807">That would have been niggardly and it would have presented many practical problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.005" offset="2899362">If the child wanted to come here, he would have to come as a foreigner.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.959" offset="2923186">He would travel on a foreign passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.660" offset="2938023">He would have to get a visa, even though special provisions might be made for visas in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.393" offset="2972923">When he got here, he would have to register as an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.394" offset="2992985">If over 18 or 21, he could not vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.793" offset="3018585">If a problem like the problem in this case arose in the fields of mathematics or the natural sciences, it would be called a boundary problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.783" offset="3078457">We want to be generous in our citizenship, but there has to be a line somewhere and this case is close to that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.283" offset="3124537">Until 1922, a situation like this was unlikely to arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.244" offset="3148361">Until that year, husband and wife were generally regarding as having the same citizenship and that was the husbands.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.158" offset="3187963">As early as 1790, Congress provided that a child born abroad would be a citizen if his father was a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.592" offset="3237700">At least from 1907, it was the American Law that a wife lost her citizenship if she married an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.539" offset="3273540">And this Court upheld the validity of that result in Mackenzie against Hare in 239 U.S.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="800.902" offset="3306977">Mr. Solicitor General, where is Mr. Bellei been living since the suit was charged him?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="805.572" stopTime="1252.942">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="805.572" offset="3325680">I understand he has been living most recently in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.064" offset="3339577">He is not been living in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.444" offset="3361102">I believe that appears in the stipulation, although the stipulation was entered into close to two years ago and I don’t know where he has been living since that time, but there’s nothing that indicated that he is been in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.232" offset="3428289">When both parents are citizens, the family is likely to be an American family.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.353" offset="3456815">And it is appropriate that the children should be American citizens even though they are born abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.440" offset="3485132">But the situation gets closer to the line when only one parent is a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.976" offset="3507284">If the father is foreign and the family lives in his country as was the situation here, the chances are that it is essentially a foreign family.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.270" offset="3556498">At any rate, the case for citizenship is not as clear or may well have seem to Congress not to be so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.550" offset="3597563">In mathematics and the natural sciences, it is well recognized that when situation to approach a boundary of one sort or another, rules which otherwise seem absolute may no longer be absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.059" offset="3651584">If one examines water at many different temperatures, he may well conclude that the density of water increases as the temperature decreases and that it fixed indefinite rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.859" offset="3702784">This is more or less a constant and is known as the co-efficient of expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.232" offset="3724309">But it’s well known when the temperature of water gets down to four degrees centigrade, the rule no longer applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.739" offset="3754297">In the area just short of the freezing boundary, the density of water decreases as the temperature goes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.403" offset="3788988">Sometimes at or near the boundary, things become stretched out, attenuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.646" offset="3822007">Even in the case of Fourth Amendment rights, this Court has recognized that the relation of a person to the premises or the time factors involved may make the effective of violation so attenuated that the constitutional provision is no longer applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.938" offset="3903091">The rule or concept that citizenship is an absolute surely as a very general validity, of course, citizenship in every aspect is always subject to the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.122" offset="3975816">It may never be taken away arbitrarily, but it does not necessarily follow that there cannot be qualification or a conditions with respect to citizenship depending on the circumstances of its acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.099" offset="4043734">As to two classes of citizenship, the situation is constitutionally clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.094" offset="4071737">These maybe called Fourteenth Amendment citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.097" offset="4087724">In the words of the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment, they are all persons born in the United States and all persons naturalized in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.612" offset="4137775">There can be no conditions or qualifications on their citizenship because the constitution gives them that citizenship as this Court has held in Kennedy against Mendoza-Martinez with respect to a native born citizen and in Schneider against Rusk and Afroyim against Rusk with respect to naturalized citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.369" offset="4232861">The provisions in the Fourteenth Amendment, however, made no reference to the citizenship of children born abroad of American parents; the type of citizenship which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.874" offset="4286882">In this, it followed the Civil Rights Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.231" offset="4312273">In the brief of amici curiae at page 9, it is said, “Since at that time, there were doubtless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.234" offset="4348322">No Negro Americans oversees, the amendment contained no reference to foreign born Americans.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.666" offset="4390013">But I think it may well be suggested that this was so and that the omission may have been intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.010" offset="4419375">There was the American colonization society which undertook to settle Liberia, was Negro Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.954" offset="4451140">And the constitution of Liberia was written by Professor Simon Greenleaf of the Harvard Law School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.483" offset="4477262">Under the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment, the Negroes who went to settle in Liberia were American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.285" offset="4512475">Although I know of no evidence one way or another, it may have been the intention not to provide that their children should be citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.768" offset="4554480">This case does not involve a person born in the United States with respect to persons born abroad that we may take alternative positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.541" offset="4605576">We may contend in the first place that citizenship in such cases is not acquired by naturalization, but by an independent power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.530" offset="4657507">A power in Congress to grant citizenship according to its judgment, a power which Congress has exercised from the time of the first Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.127" offset="4703901">Only seven years ago, Congress granted citizenship to Sir Winston Churchill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.044" offset="4731591">Obviously, that cannot be rested on the power of Congress to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.505" offset="4769416">And Congress has passed many Acts granting citizenship to individuals whose citizenship was doubtful, particularly in the case of women who married foreigners and then returned to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.477" offset="4853321">Does anyone think that these statutes were beyond the power of Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.210" offset="4876204">Similarly, Congress has given citizenship to all of the people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and before that to all the people in Hawaii and Alaska, except Indians in Alaska who were excluded in the 1867 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.961" offset="4947257">At the last argument of this case, it was asked if Congress could give citizenship to all the people of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.508" offset="4977455">I have no doubt that it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.414" offset="4989053">Indeed some 60 years ago, there was some talk of merger between the United States and Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.517" offset="5017475">And if that had progressed further, a grant of citizenship would obviously have been a part of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.215" offset="5260204">There were no provisions in the constitution for the granting of citizenship, and to a large extent, citizenship was thought of as a state matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.401" offset="5304926">Indeed many years ago and going through some old papers of a law firm that asked me to look through them to see which should be burned and which should be kept.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.633" offset="5373889">And apparently at that time, that was the normal way. You got a state passport because you were a state citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.190" offset="5456123">So Congress has the power to grant citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.993" offset="5475349">A power which we believe it can be said it has exercised in enacting Section 301(a) (7) and 301(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.926" offset="5515055">This is not Fourteenth Amendment citizenship and there is no reason, verbal or theoretical why it must be subject to all the absolute conceptions which have been attached to Fourteenth Amendment citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.295" offset="5584541">Here for good reasons, reasons which are surely valid as far as the Due Process Clause is concerned, Congress has attached the condition of Section 301(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.542" offset="5653504">This can be called “citizenship”, or preliminary citizenship, or a conditional citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.723" offset="5690284">There is no reason why Congress could not vest it with great force and significance unless and until the condition is complied with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.266" offset="6184417">Moreover, it’s clear that the privileges of citizenship are not necessarily uniform and absolute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.419" offset="6325060">Such persons are citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.041" offset="6355571">But their citizenship is subject to a condition subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.892" offset="6374902">Citizens who are in the military are treated differently from other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.852" offset="6406771">In Johansson against the United States in 225 U.S. this Court said that a grant of citizenship was closely analogous to a public grant of land and this was quoted in the Schneiderman case in 320 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.006" offset="6471346">But of course, a grant of land including a grant of public land can be made conditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.141" offset="6495901">A mining claim is a grant of public land and it gives substantial vested rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.141" offset="6519933">But such claims have long been subject to a condition of work performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.159" offset="6543966">There is a similar condition with respect to Homestead claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.393" offset="6560893">The Homesteader loses his rights if he does not live upon the land and work it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.802" offset="6590568">But beyond that, let us look at this very statute: Under Section 301(a) (7), citizenship can be transmitted only through a citizen parent “who prior to the birth of the child was physically present in the United States or its outlying possession for a period or periods totaling not less than 10 years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of 14 years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.200" offset="6724211">Thus, if this Court holds that the appellee is a citizen, he will not be a citizen with exactly the same qualifications as most other citizens or as his mother, for she can transmit citizenship and he cannot unless and until he meets the requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.974" offset="6811251">This qualification goes completely back to 1790; an Act of the First Congress and it was sustained by this Court in Weedin against the Chin Bow, in an opinion by Chief Justice Taft without dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.950" offset="6891186">Unless this qualification is allowed, it would mean that the constitution requires that American citizenship maybe transmitted endlessly through a single parent, generation after generation, even though there is no trace of any connection with the United States or any allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.932" offset="6987107">It seems an unnecessarily bizarre result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.447" offset="7005184">Yet if the condition of residence of the parent is sustained, not every citizen has the same qualifications and status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.677" offset="7046040">And let me give another example though a small one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.507" offset="7061400">We are dealing in this case with Section 301(a) (7).</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.916" offset="7083029">Immediately before it, is Section 301(a) (6) which provides for citizenship at birth or (6) a person of unknown parentage found in the United States while under the age of five years until shown prior to his attaining the age of 21 years not to have been born in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.681" offset="7194102">Now, this is a sensible and humane provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.235" offset="7212283">Yet if it is valid I hope it is, we have another instance of citizenship subject to a condition subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.746" offset="7254392">Now, the other way to look at this problem is to say that Sections 301(a) (7) and (b) are an exercise by Congress of its power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.351" offset="7312802">But that like other naturalizations, this is a process which takes time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.938" offset="7335163">It requires substantial proof of prospective allegiance and the individuals involved are not naturalized until the conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.512" offset="7381452">In ordinary naturalization of foreigners within the United States, a five-year period residence is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.418" offset="7417083">In the situation involved in this case, many of the incidences of citizenship are conferred at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.565" offset="7445608">But the naturalization process is not completed until the residency requirement is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.150" offset="7476015">And it is that process in its entirety to which reference is made on the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.226" offset="7508302">It’s true of course that the wording of the statute as its stands now speaks in terms of citizenship and not of the naturalization process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.737" offset="7558353">But if a process of naturalization is the purpose and effect of the statute, it should be given that effect in law that this was the purpose as shown by the history of the statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.317" offset="7620629">A precedent may indeed be found in the Welch case decided last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.718" offset="7650200">The problem there was to make the statute valid in the light of this Court’s view of the constitutional requirements of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.463" offset="7693249">The situation here is exactly parallel if the court does find that there are constitutional difficulties here under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.502" offset="7741419">In 1939 when the appellee was born, the statute then in effect was that of 1934, printed on page 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.457" offset="7785200">I have already called the attention to the fact that that statute was in terms of -- in the right of citizenship shall not descend unless the child comes to the United States and in addition takes an oath of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.406" offset="7860955">This sounds like a condition precedent rather than subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.593" offset="7889795">And moreover and of first importance, isn’t it unduly formalistic to make this case turn on whether the condition is precedent or subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.022" offset="7935457">It’s like talking about conditional remainders and springing uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.840" offset="7954683">When the intention of Congress is perfectly clear, there is no Due Process violation in giving effect to that intention and no reason except the purely conceptual one for denying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.531" offset="8021452">The relevant statute was amended in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.223" offset="8036289">This puts it in condition subsequent terms and this was carried forward in the 1952 revision involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.575" offset="8073697">But there is nothing to indicate that this was anything other than a verbal or stylistic change or that Congress contemplated that it was changing the law as far as it was applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.113" offset="8131793">Moreover, there are some provisions in the naturalization part of the statute which are applicable to a child born abroad with one parent of citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.103" offset="8175783">Under Section 320 on the Nationality Act, such a child is naturalized if the alien parent is naturalized while the child is under 16 and the child is resident in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.545" offset="8241507">And under Section 322 such a child under the age of 18 years maybe naturalized on the application of the citizen parent, if both are resident in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.844" offset="8298768">Can it be suppose that Congress would have made provision for naturalization of such children within the United States, if it was the understanding of Congress that they were full citizens already?</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.139" offset="8359894">Does this not support the view that Sections 301(a) (7) and (b) can be fairly and properly construed as an essence naturalization statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.639" offset="8409945">Providing for a process by which such a child becomes a full citizen on completion of the conditions prescribed; conditions which are wholly appropriate for a naturalization statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.804" offset="8470549">Finally, I would suggest a question of separability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.613" offset="8493850">If Section 301(b) is invalid, is it clear that Congress would have enacted Section 301(a) (7) as it did?</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.378" offset="8536900">If Congress could have achieved its purpose by casting Section 301(a) (7) in terms of a condition subsequent, is it not clear that it would not have enacted Section 301(a) (7) as it now stands without enacting Section 301(b) at the same time?</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.998" offset="8623313">In that event, should not Section 301(a) (7) fall if Section 301(b) falls?</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.812" offset="8658631">I submit that it should thus giving Congress a clean slate to write upon in the event that it is purely formal choice of words led to constitutional difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.041" offset="8715577">The judgment below should be reversed and the constitutional validity of Sections 301(a) (7) and 301(b) should be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2224.675" offset="9002088">I think to me, it is perfectly plain that the results of by Congress here can be achieved in all its details or virtually all its details by formal, verbal changes even though this Court holds Section 301(b) invalid and I would anticipate that Congress would proceed in that line, not to abandon the citizenship for one-parent-children born abroad entirely, but to subject it to a condition precedent rather than a condition subsequent which seems to me to emphasize the essential formal detail, verbal nature of the issue which is raised here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.749" offset="9398418">1934 was amended in 1940, I think a more correct statement would be that Section 1993 as amended was repealed by the Nationality Act of 1940, but there was a Saving Clause which provided that this repeal shall not terminate nationality here to for lawfully acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.882" offset="9490892">The Solicitor General referred to five brief visits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.795" offset="9514506">If I were stating that on behalf of appellee, I would say that he made visits here which were substantially, were all about three months or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.480" offset="9553272">He came here from April 27 of 48 to July 31, 1948; this was to visit his grandparents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.011" offset="9579395">His mother was born and raised in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.155" offset="9592038">She lived there until after her 24th birthday, she married the appellee and a few days later went to Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.188" offset="9628087">She has always been an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.150" offset="9635924">She’s prized that as has the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.415" offset="9653060">He registered for selective service in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.561" offset="9673644">He passed his test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.524" offset="9685452">He was due to be inducted but he was working on a NATO defense program as a result of which he was deferred and then he was later on told “well, we’ve taken your citizenship away”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.115" offset="9743862">Now Mr. Justice Harlan in answer to your question, at the time of drafting the stipulation, he was in England working on a NATO defense project for a company called Magical Limited, he is at present back in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.919" offset="9811048">But further on his visit, there was another visit from July 10, of '51 to October 5, of '51.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.100" offset="9835813">There was another visit from June of '55 until October of '55.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.092" offset="9851695">These aren’t brief visits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.585" offset="9857755">These are visits for substantial periods of time and they were to visit his maternal grandparents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.730" offset="9886281">When he married in Italy, he wanted to come over here a fifth time and this time they told him “well, your American citizenship has expired.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.459" offset="9921181">He again wanted to come here to visit his maternal grandparents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.577" offset="9945631">For 12 years, Aldo Mario Bellei had his own United States passport as an American citizen from 1952 until 1964, and this is what the Government now says that without his consent, they can't take away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.303" offset="10024626">I do read these statutes but with a slightly different emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.537" offset="10045524">The Solicitor General pointed out there in the Government’s brief at 45 and 46 and the way that now reads, it says “the following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.432" offset="10101112">And when it comes to taking the nationality away, it’s an expatriation statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.045" offset="10119502">It says any person who is a national and citizen of the United States at birth under the Section I’ve just read shall lose his nationality and citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.384" offset="10160880">That is an expatriation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.294" offset="10180524">Now, the Solicitor General asked what provison was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.595" offset="10193795">A Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and I am not asking for any absolute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.292" offset="10216573">I am relying on Schneider against Rusk which I say is precisely in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.790" offset="10246562">Now, Angelica Schneider was not a Fourteenth Amendment citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.601" offset="10265788">Angelica Schneider never stood up in any United States Court, raised her hand and swore an oath of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.779" offset="10294523">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.063" offset="10295672">Her mother did that and then the statute said and that statute to be found in 8 USC Section 1432 or immigration and nationality lawyers would refer to that as Section 321 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and that says in its very caption, “automatic citizenship”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.546" offset="10421582">So what I am relying on as a case being precisely in point is Schneider against Rusk and I submit to this Court that Angelica Schneider was just as much a statutory citizen if that's what the Government wanted to draw the distinction between statutory and Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.063" offset="10491591">Angelica Schneider was just as much as statutory citizen as Aldo Mario Bellei.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.319" offset="10516668">And if Schneider against Rusk is to be followed where the court held that the Section which required Angelica Schneider to have her citizenship taken away because she returned to the country of her origin for three years, I say by a parity of reasoning, if that provision as held on constitution as it was on the ground that more over while the Fifth Amendment contains no Equal Protection Clause, it does forbid discrimination that it is so unjustifiable as to be violating of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.708" offset="10646235">If that decision is correct, then the provision requiring Aldo Mario Bellei to come here and be here for five years between the ages of 14 and 28, likewise, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.829" offset="10714676">Now, I am asking for no absolute but I am asking on the basis of Schneider against Rusk that where this Government has given citizenship at birth, it cannot come along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.466" offset="10777266">Under the circumstances of this case and take it away without the voluntary act of the one who got citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.886" offset="11398875">I can call the Court's attention to the fact that on December 4, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.790" offset="11422490">Senator Kennedy on behalf of himself and 23 other Senators introduced S3202 in the 91st Congress First Session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.437" offset="11461151">It is in its second session now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.297" offset="11468570">A bill to revise the Immigration and Nationality Act, that bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.622" offset="11501902">Now respecting Section 21 of this bill, Senator Kennedy stated this as found in the 115 Congressional record; page 15612 of the daily edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.316" offset="11548609">This important segment of public policy has been ignored and overlooked by the Congress since the codification and amendment of Nationality and Naturalization Laws in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.978" offset="11595316">There is little doubt that many provisions in the basic statute are product of a harsher period in our nation’s history and should have no place in the public policy of a free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.279" offset="11648502">But aside from this Court’s decisions in recent years have altered the statute considerably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.928" offset="11671071">The situation clearly demands a comprehensive review and evaluation of our nationality and naturalization policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.459" offset="11705240">So that entering that question of course, one cannot say what Congress is going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.507" offset="11729377">But my feeling would be that if that Congress did act, it would as it has done a number of times in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.851" offset="11762813">Ameliorate the situation and bring about the result that I am asking this Court for right now in affirming the judgment of the court below on the basis of Schneider against Rusk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.885" offset="11850898">So that I say that citizenship as an absolute is not an issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4600.349" offset="18504808">But there are other burdens such as subjection to judicial process under the Blackmer case, paying of taxes and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.240" offset="18536364">I think there are a whole collection of burdens here which would be very difficult for these foreign born Americans for the first 23 years to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.549" offset="18589550">May I deal very briefly with this fundamental question, which is raised by the Solicitor General that is to say that if it were possible for the Congress to lay down a conditioned precedent, it must thereby be possible for the Congress to apply a condition subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.741" offset="18650363">In our view, the difference is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.097" offset="18667708">It would be one thing and would not concede the reasonableness of this and it would be one thing for the Congress to say that these people are not citizens but can become citizens at age 21 upon complying with residence requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.418" offset="18717027">It's a very different thing to strip them of their citizenship, and reading the decisions of this Court over the years, one sees two fundamental reasons for this; first, the unfairness of taking away citizenship once vested given the willingness the fact that the people have accepted for 23 years rights and obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.179" offset="18784110">And second, the danger of taking away the civil liberties of Americans through the back door by involuntary expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.054" offset="18815561">That it seems to me is the distinction between the condition precedent and the condition subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.782" offset="18838549">And finally, to please the Court, the second pillar of the argument we’re making is that the Court held in Schneider v. Rusk that a residence requirement for a naturalized Americans violated the Fifth Amendment because it involved the discrimination unjustifiable and that is the kind of discrimination which is the case before us.</text>
