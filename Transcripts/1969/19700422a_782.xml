            <text syncTime="28.076" offset="215646">The class is defined as those people who are incarcerated in the Baltimore City Jail and we have defined it as a continuing class.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.574" offset="257651">We brought this action in July 1968 and there are currently about a 150 people in the Baltimore City Jail under the statute that we are attacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.009" offset="323375">This case is different from the Williams case that the Court has just heard, in that there, only I -- and unusual application of the jail or fine statute was being contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.927" offset="387114">The situation where the judge gives both the maximum jail sentence and a fine, and the person is required to serve more than the maximum amount allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.834" offset="438732">Our case covers all types of incarceration for non-payment of fines except the contumacious refusal to pay situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.087" offset="491708">We're not concerned with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.723" offset="502262">Our case involves a two-dollar rate instead of a five-dollar rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.674" offset="534026">It is a mandatory rate as the statute says the judge shall commit him and then pursuant to the terms of the statute, then the statute provides a two-dollar rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.968" offset="1551235">It upheld the Maryland $2.00 a day statute as constitutional on its face, but it held that in each case, the sentencing judge had to hold a hearing to allow persons to be committed to tell a judge about their indigency and give him an opportunity to decide whether or not do reduce the fine or to put them on probation or to allow them to pay in installments or to commit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.192" offset="1688116">And it also held that as the statute was being applied with respect to costs at that particular time, the statute was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.643" offset="1833984">We have appealed from the statute under -- from this decision under the authority of Article XXVIII, Section 1253, and our basic contention in this Court boils down really to one premise, and that is that one 24-hour day in jail with all of that entails in terms of the stigma in the community and that fact the man may loose his job, the fact that man maybe subjected to the unpleasant experiences of the jail, one 24-hour a day in jail does not equal dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.467" offset="4897207">Now, there are other things that the state can do in order to punish the man or deter the man that are more equal to a fine that he cannot -- that one of the arguments that's been raised says there's no way that the state can punish these people; no way that they can deter them and that just is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.747" offset="4974320">There are other things that can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.637" offset="4989889">One that we've suggested is that man can be allowed to pay in installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.155" offset="5023953">This is actually fulfilling the sentence of the judge who sentenced them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.960" offset="5039208">He wanted them to pay a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.306" offset="5044642">He thought that was the deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.899" offset="5054986">The state legislature provided that the judge could fine him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.436" offset="5073168">They expected him to use his best judgment in deciding what was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.064" offset="5091662">He decided the fine was appropriate and the way that he can carry out the state legislature's intent in the situation is to allow the man to pay on terms that he can pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.184" offset="5140146">This is certainly a more equal alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.008" offset="5155401">Now, suppose the man cannot pay, he can still put him in jail as the model penal code suggests, if the man fails to make a showing that he has made reasonable efforts to make the money, get the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.853" offset="5230738">In that case, they'll be putting him in jail for contempt or for some additional act or omission, he can take away his driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.718" offset="5278281">As the Rinaldi versus Yeager case suggested, they can garnish his salary if he has any or collect the judgment by attachment, probably not a feasible way of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.426" offset="5337109">They can put him on probation with conditions that he worked in the court house, you don't have to lock him up in maximum security in order to get some work out of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.811" offset="5378591">They can send him to driver's school.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.495" offset="5485380">My brother is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.992" offset="5491336">The first argument are intend to make is that this case is moot in light of the statute recently passed by the Maryland legislature as an emergency Bill in Title Chapter 147 and it was signed by Governor Mandel on the 15th of April.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.489" offset="5561344">This statute under Section 6 is retroactive in its application and therefore, the plaintiffs or the appellants in this case may take advantage of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.709" offset="5598229">It provides that any person incarcerated for default of payment of a fine may apply for a hearing or by general order of the court may have a hearing on his indigent status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.321" offset="5652668">The court after conducting an inquiry if it finds that this individual is unable to pay the fine immediately, the court may provide installment payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.631" offset="5689866">If the court finds that installment payments are not feasible under the circumstances, then may offer to the defendant substitute punishment, and this is the theory under which Maryland has enacted its legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.968" offset="5743261">The theory that there must be an alternative punishment appropriately imposed upon a defendant upon whom financial criminal sanctions would have no relevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.282" offset="5796551">And in this case in the Maryland statute, the court cannot impose a confinement that exceeds $10.00 a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.136" offset="5835943">That is to state that the -- if the fine is $500.00 and the court finds that the defendant is indigent, it may state that I believe that one day in jail is sufficient, but the court cannot impose a sentence which would exceed $10.00 a day; that is the minimum that it can allow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2163.708" offset="8758209">Our statute states that in that case, he shall not serve more than one-third of the term provided for imprisonment or 90 days whichever is less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.099" offset="8799796">But the problem arises of course in the case where only a fine is provided as a penalty and I submit that it is not a denial of equal protection of the laws to offer to this man or to impose upon him an alternative punishment since he is unable because of his poverty which obtained about through no fault of his own and presumably for the purpose of this case to no fault at anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.048" offset="8903555">Now, to do otherwise would be asking this Court or would as I believe the -- to ask -- the appellants would be asking this Court to correct every inequity that existed in our society because of the poverty that's there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2231.169" offset="9028002">Although, I submit that this is perhaps the most enlightening statute in the nation insofar as the punishment is concerned, I believe that the cases have held and this Court has held many times before that the court simply will not substitute its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.749" offset="9090382">Now, the sole question therefore as I view it is whether the alternative punishment theory is constitutional, not whether -- it is the best alternative that could be offered, but whether it is a meet the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause, and I say that it does because it's a reasonable classification, and secondly because it is related directly to a legitimate state interest.</text>
