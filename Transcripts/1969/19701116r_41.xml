            <label>Mr. Lonny F. Zwiener</label>
            <text syncTime="38.560" offset="257651">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.282" offset="284505">This case is up for re-argument only the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.910" offset="311045">We argued this matter last spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.996" offset="327346">The facts as I told the court then and Mr. Chief Justice I can confirm, I think at least as far as Texas is concerned, there has been a tremendous increase in three-judge federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.194" offset="372172">I think I handled all for the Attorney General's office, a couple of years ago and had two or three pending at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.382" offset="400906">Now we have something like 30 and no longer can I do all the three-judge work.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.782" offset="438523">But, in all of the three-judge court cases that I have, I think I would trade the facts in anyone of the other case for the facts in this one which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.705" offset="482200">This began in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.361" offset="496828">It involved the seizure and the filing of a complaint involving an underground newspaper, the Dallas Notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.776" offset="542490">In this situation the complaint for the violation of the Texas obscenity laws was filed and the police under search warrant went out and seized the Dallas Notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.291" offset="600586">They not only got the printed newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.859" offset="606856">They picked up any paper that was around that could have been use.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.502" offset="625351">They got the furniture, -- whatever they considered might have been the tools or the implements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.719" offset="662235">As I say, I would trade these facts for almost any others.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.705" offset="678222">I don't particularly like the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.375" offset="688880">But in any event, charges were filed, misdemeanor charges were filed in the Dallas courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.800" offset="718555">The defendants in those state criminal cases then went into the Federal District Court, asked that an injunction be issued against the pending prosecutions, against future prosecutions, ask that the Texas obscenity law be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.102" offset="823777">And this was done prior to anything really happening in the state courts, I would say, but I don't really consider that that is significant at least in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.348" offset="876753">Now, the three-judge court was convened and that three-judge court held the Texas obscenity statute to be unconstitutional for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.608" offset="925759">One, the statute in one of its Sections purportedly punished private possession of obscene materials, violating the injunction laid down by this Court in Stanley versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.614" offset="993782">The court refused to separate or savor that part of the statute out and says that they were not going to make that separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.754" offset="1030353">The whole prohibition section is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.723" offset="1054281">They also found that the definition of obscenity in this Texas statute was lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.667" offset="1094092">This statute was passed shortly after this Court's decision in Roth and followed the definition laid down to the court in Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.644" offset="1141948">The three-judge court below here found that this Court had in Memoirs and in Jacobellis it lodged on or amplified or explained the Roth decision and that the Texas statute was fatality defective because it failed to have the redeeming social value feature in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.701" offset="1230137">So for those two reasons, the court below felt that the statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.382" offset="1264933">They did not enjoin the pending prosecutions, but they enjoined all future prosecutions effectively stopping any prosecution at least at that time in Dallas County.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.487" offset="1321357">I might say to the court that the Dallas statute has been amended since this decision and we now have the Memoirs type definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.543" offset="1377573">We have read out of the statute a prohibition against private possession and as best we could try to comport with the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.071" offset="1427623">But in any event, this was the old statute, we did argue that it was capable of constitutional interpretation that we didn't have to return indictments for mere private possession and that if no redeeming social value was a part of the test of obscenity, that this could have been taken care of by a court's choice to the jury and I think this Court in a number of cases has permitted state amendment to bring a state statute into constitutional interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.646" offset="1549981">Several statutes in the abstinence (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="365.632" offset="1565863">But, here we argue first off that the statute was constitutional and we secondly say that no injunction should have been issued against future prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.800" offset="1610585">We say that the injunctions should not have issued because of adapting of abstention, the doctrine that equity will not interfere in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.472" offset="1669308">And we also say that 2283 of anti-injunction statute may very well apply to future prosecutions that are not pending as well as two pending prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="681.426" offset="2829040">Well, I don't know the answer to that although -- except as I have suggested -- this decision was on the books and still is on the books as far as the old statute is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.522" offset="2889435">So, and as I say they -- I'm sure they hesitate to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.190" offset="2904168">Now, I would say there's another factor too, they're worried now that they've gotten into the field of obscenity about the case, they probably have against Dallas Notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.145" offset="2939904">So many things have gotten worse in this area since this arrest was made almost two years ago that they probably would be perfectly frank, they don't like the looks of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.982" offset="2987342">They've got stag movies to go after now and this, the Dallas Notes was very tamed compared to what is being purveyed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.864" offset="3030810">Probably poor answer but in any event I do say and would like to add to what was said this morning as to 2283 prohibiting pending prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.408" offset="3080965">I think this is a possibility, I don't think this Court has ever completely settled that in Dombrowski, of course they had suggested there was a difference between pending and future prosecutions but only for the purposes of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.179" offset="3140106">And I, like several others before me and it becomes kind of hard to find something that has not been said before in these cluster of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.971" offset="3183261">I do think it's just as harmful to state federal relations to enjoin future prosecutions as if it is pending prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="801.787" offset="3310529">At that time, you told me I was asking for an advisory opinion and I had to kind of nod my head and smile sheepishly and concede perhaps that was true because if I won as far as the injunction, you might not have to decide obscenity but I suggest to this court, that anytime a federal court considers a state statute, the constitutionality of it and does not enter or issue an injunction but merely decides that the statute is unconstitutional, it has rendered an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.600" offset="3465801">It's decided the statute is unconstitutional and does not issue an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.693" offset="3486177">I say the only reason that the federal court should be considered in the constitutionality of the state statute is to determine whether or not an injunction should issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.437" offset="5417148">Quite the contrary, we were prepared to try to litigate the pending criminal cases in the state court but we're frightened about future prosecutions which threatened the existence of this underground paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.860" offset="5482768">This was not a resort -- this was not a raise to a forum but rather a resort to the federal court to seek protection for substantial federal rights that were threatened with extinction by the Dallas police, let me trace, if I may the evolution of our pleadings and partly in response to Mr. Zwiener's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.820" offset="5590601">Although when our initial complaint was filed, it did seek injunction against the pending prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.498" offset="5617351">This was stricken from our complaint and we restricted our complaint, our First Amendment amended complaint to simply a prayer for relief against police harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.294" offset="5676596">This appears on page 30 of our record and a declaration of the statute's unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.104" offset="5715780">We were content to litigate the matter in a single-judge court at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.639" offset="5733961">The state then filed its response on March 20, 10 days later and urged at page 43 of the record, that this matter had to be resolved by a three-judge court that is urged that as I understand their pleading that even though we sought only declaratory relief that nevertheless required the convening of three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.344" offset="5824763">So as appears on the record on page 75, a three-judge court was convened in order to determine whether or not three-judge questions were presented and at that stage in order to take the jurisdictional issue out of the case, we re-instituted a demand for injunctive relief not against pending prosecutions but only against future prosecutions, thereby hoping to obviate some of the difficulties in the case but on hind side, I think we would have been very advised I suspect to leave our pleadings just for declaratory relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.179" offset="6540100">There was never an adequate explanation of why they sought to seize the telephones but presumably they likened the telephones in as much as they were an adjunct to the publication of the newspaper as simply part of the contraband they were taking when they made their raid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.358" offset="6612825">The raid by the way, the two raids were made upon a two storey house that served as the residence of the plaintiff Stein, he lived upstairs and in the part of the lower floor they put out their underground newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.732" offset="6682311">On the first, they not only arrested and charged the plaintiff Stein but they arrested and charged on both occasions everyone they found on the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.708" offset="8354252">But, and as I say I think the lower court below was con -- felt that conceivably by declaring a statute unconstitutional that might stay the hand of the police in the sense that they were relying upon its over breadth and swirling around my plaintiff's place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.409" offset="8433037">Parenthetically the injunction that issued -- the court's opinion issued on June 9, 1969, the lower court opinion declaring the statute unconstitutional, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.699" offset="8478177">On June 10, 1969, the Texas legislature enacted its amended statute which Mr. Zwiener has alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.794" offset="8518510">So for all parenthetically also, the injunction ran only to the plaintiff, it didn't run to a broad class of plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.166" offset="8540035">It did not run to the world at large so the injunction that was issued here was a very narrow injunction, protected this plaintiff against prosecution under the old statute and declared that statute unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2514.918" offset="10163075">That is the Senate Report in its concluding paragraph with respect to the declaratory judgment procedure stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.475" offset="10213230">Finally it may be said that the declaratory judgment procedure has been molded and settled by thousands of precedents so that the administration of the law has been definitely clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.944" offset="10251160">The Supreme Court mentioned one of its principal purposes in the Terrace versus Thompson when it said, “They are not obligated to take the risk of prosecution, fines and imprisonment and loss of property in order to secure an adjudication of their rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2576.379" offset="10408939">In this context, declaratory relief as to the constitutionality of the statute was indeed, it seems the only swift and appropriate remedy that might assure us that as to the future, we could or could not proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.955" offset="10471215">It was in our view at least then a traditional form of declaratory judgment proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.778" offset="10502457">The early cases of course did come out of business enterprise kinds of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.931" offset="11903143">(Voice Overlap) only two things I would like to say, first, as far as the police activity in this particular case, I'd like to say something about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.386" offset="11940968">I'm not part of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.941" offset="11947133">Have I told the court several times?</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.335" offset="11956746">But the minute that this situation came to the attention of the city attorney's office in Dallas, they no longer -- police can't get search warrants for First Amendment printed material without conferring with the city attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.696" offset="12018186">This also precipitated the amendment of the obscenity statute and this was done not after the court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.683" offset="12050056">The wheels began to turn much before this Court below held a statute unconstitutional but it does sometime, the police perhaps do not act properly but I do think when it gets to thee district attorney or the county attorney, the city attorney, in their office, the brakes can be put on and really I think they can do it pretty well without the federal court intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.785" offset="12158516">I would say something about this declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.293" offset="12168547">Apparently the plaintiffs here or a number of people here are asking declaratory judgment doctrine be extended to encompass just everything, one judge, declaratory judgment can pass on any state statute that somebody's worried about and the ridiculousness of this thing is that we've had a attack on sodomy statute, a couple came in and said, “We would like to practice sodomy in the bedroom but this statute is bothering us, the existence of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.962" offset="12283173">And that they -- that was a case of controversy, there were several other parties to this but this can -- I think show the extent that this thing can lead to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.972" offset="12323297">Again, I suggest really and I don't -- I apologize to the court in a sense for saying this but Zwickler versus Koota which tells the lower federal courts that they should consider the constitutionality of the state statutes even where no injunction is proper, I think is authorizing advisory opinions.</text>
