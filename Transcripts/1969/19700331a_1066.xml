            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="42.012" offset="271444">The question in this case is whether the State of Arizona may constitutionally limit the right to participate in general obligation bond elections to real property taxpayers whose property in such an election, the City of Phoenix, will put up as collateral security for the repayment of the bond obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.158" offset="364022">And whose property is subject to lien of those bonds during the life of the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.401" offset="385024">The relevant facts in this particular case can be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.264" offset="400384">On June 10, 1969, there was submitted to the real property taxpayers in the City of Phoenix the largest aggregate of bond issues ever proposed by that city.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.998" offset="451375">Calling for a total of $170 million to finance very badly needed improvements in the City of Phoenix, urgently needed at that time and even more urgently needed at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.744" offset="506337">Two of these issues related to general or revenue bond issues and the other eight were general obligation bond issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.737" offset="542281">Some six days after the election was held, this Court handed down its decisions in Kramer versus Union Free School District and Cipriano versus City of Houma.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.167" offset="588048">The latter of which held that it was unconstitutional to prohibit non-property owners from voting in a revenue bond election.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.398" offset="624933">According to Cipriano applied its holding prospectively only and held open the question of the applicability of Cipriano to general obligation bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.825" offset="666624">Because of the cloud which Cipriano casts over the bonds of the City of Phoenix, because of the urgent need on the part of the City of Phoenix for the facilities which were to be financed by these bonds, this suit was just brought raising the question which this Court now has before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.392" offset="748962">Ms. Kolodziejski, the plaintiff in this case, is an employee of the leading investment banking firm in the City of Phoenix specializing in municipal bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.553" offset="785533">She owns no real property and she rents her living quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.902" offset="802983">It's been stipulated that the real property taxes which her landlord pays have a material bearing on the amount of tax which or in the amount of rent which she is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.651" offset="862020">A question which arises at the outset of this case concerns the relevant test which is to be applied to determine the right of the state through its Constitution and its statutes, to prescribe qualifications under which resident citizens of the City of Phoenix can participate in general obligation bond elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.449" offset="1017187">Mr. Justice Harlan, in my opinion, the answer to that question is yes, but no one really knows the answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.528" offset="1053445">The State of Arizona unlike the State of Louisiana does not have and so far as I know there's really only one state that has a statute exactly like the one with Louisiana does not have the kind of statute that provides what they call a preemption period at the end of which there is no further challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.361" offset="1124812">Arizona is really at the other end of the spectrum in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.565" offset="1153651">The only election challenge statute that exists is a five-day period which was obviously intended to apply to election of people, election of officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.304" offset="1196596">There is one governing case which is rather difficult to read and lawyers could differ on exactly what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.522" offset="1221465">Suffice it to say there is serious question -- serious question under the laws of the State of Arizona whether there ever comes a time that there's no longer the opportunity to challenge a bond election.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.306" offset="1456567">That is correct and if not filed within the five-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.081" offset="1467747">But I reiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.995" offset="1475375">We have not raised that as a defense and do not wish to at this time because we need this issue decided and we feel that under as the matter of Arizona State law; number one, there is a question whether she did or did not filed it within the proper period of time and number two, in my opinion it's a matter if this -- if this can be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.542" offset="1557504">And we are not relying on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.093" offset="1571715">This Court over a period of a century has laid down the very salutary rule and a rule as reflected at least half-a-dozen separate decisions of this Court that in determining which of it's citizens will be allowed to vote, the states are allowed a broad discretion setting qualifications and determining the circumstances and the qualifications under which of its resident citizens will be allowed to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.172" offset="1720090">There was an exception carved out from that general rule by this Court's decision last term in Kramer versus Union Free School District and because that exception lies at the heart of the resolution of the issue on this case, it is important to know the precise circumstances under which that exception prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.565" offset="1797622">Therefore, it is important; I feel to look at the exact language of the Kramer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.180" offset="1824057">Kramer spelled out that the circumstances under which the exception to the general rule applies is as follows: that the broad latitude which usually accord to legislative judgments in this area is based on the assumption that the institutions of State Government are fairly constituted and that when the attack is an attack on that very assumption and the assumption itself can no longer serve as the basis for presuming constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.701" offset="1966164">It follows, in the view of the Kramer Court that the general rule upholding the judgment of legislators were reasonable and I'm quoting now “does not extend to decisions concerning which resident citizens may participate in the election of legislators and other public officials”.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.699" offset="2046203">And the Court was very specific on this point and reiterated it a number of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.310" offset="2064593">Now, it is true as Justice Stewart pointed out in his dissent in Kramer that it was not limited to the election of the New York legislature which necessarily imposed that limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.645" offset="2109942">Nevertheless, whether right or wrong in Kramer and I accept it as stare decisis whether right or wrong in Kramer, the rationale of Kramer was that that limitation applied only when you're electing people.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.672" offset="2162082">When you're electing the general policy making bonds of the state on one of its political subdivisions; the state legislature, the school board in Kramer, the city council in this case and bond elections do not fit within that exception category.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.700" offset="2222164">Therefore, we submit that the limitation involved in this case must be upheld --</text>

            <text syncTime="583.556" offset="2437622">But Mr. Justice Stewart's and Mr. Justice Black's dissent in that case pointed out that under any circumstances, there was not a reasonable basis for the exclusion in Cipriano and the reason was that there's simply was not a reasonable connection between exclusion of property orders in a revenue bonds election or not that hangs upon the difference between revenue bonds, the general obligation bonds and I propose that bear down very heavily on that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.919" offset="2535006">The most that can be said about Cipriano, Mr. Justice Harlan is that it was very bare dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.151" offset="2556008">It's a pre curiam opinion have down the last day of the term and I don't want to -- all I can say is it was simply a kind of a wash over from Kramer and if you read Kramer carefully, it should not be made to extend to any kind of bond election and I do not feel to borrow the -- borrow the phrase used by the Solicitor General that a century of this Court's decisions should be laid to rest with nothing more than the simple statement of compelling state interest in the Cipriano opinion without any attempt to reconcile it with the rather careful reasoning, whether right or wrong that was set forth in Kramer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.790" offset="6534562">The reason was of course that especially for schools and that's one reason why it's even more important to hold the prospective and general obligation bond context and it is in the revenue bond context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.969" offset="7699205">The question on this case is whether the State of Arizona may constitutionally limit the right to participate in general obligation bond elections to real property taxpayers whose property in such an election, the City of Phoenix will put up as collateral security for the repayment of the bond obligation and whose property is subject to the lien of those bonds during the life of the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.411" offset="7812995">The relevant facts in this particular case can be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.281" offset="7828459">On June 10, 1969 there was submitted to the real property taxpayers in the City of Phoenix, the largest aggregate of bond issues ever proposed by that city.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.694" offset="7934098">Two of these issues related to general or to revenue bond issues and the other eight were general obligation bond issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.762" offset="7970461">Some six days after the election was held, this Court handed down its decisions in Kramer versus Union Free School District and Cipriano versus City of Houma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.160" offset="8016018">The latter of which held that it was unconstitutional to prohibit non-property owners from voting in a revenue bond election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.418" offset="8053008">Court in Cipriano applied its holding prospectively only and held open the question of the applicability of Cipriano to general obligation bonds.Because of the cloud which Cipriano cast over the bonds of the City of Phoenix, because of urgent need on the part of the City of Phoenix for the facilities which were to be financed by these bonds, this suit was brought raising the question which this Court now has before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.391" offset="8176933">Ms. Kolodziejski, the plaintiff in this case, is an employee of the leading investment banking firm in the City of Phoenix specializing in municipal bonds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.662" offset="9054020">Now, let us apply this rule to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.888" offset="9078888">Ms.Kolodziejski is a lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.381" offset="9088920">She does not pay real property taxes, she owns no real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.341" offset="9108773">She owns no personal property subject to personal property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.407" offset="9133014">She -- however, it is stipulated that the rent that she pays takes the amount of the landlord's real property taxes into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.648" offset="9173974">Therefore, she will be affected by any increase in the real property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.754" offset="9198425">She also pays sales taxes which maybe used to defray the bonds but it's not an absolute requirement that the city continued to use the sales taxes for the purpose of defraying these bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.278" offset="9252446">The facts also showed that she is interested in the city affairs of the City of Phoenix and that she wants to vote in all elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.274" offset="9300511">The facts further showed that the city has for the recent years use ad valorem taxes to pay only approximately two fifths of the annual debt service on its general obligation bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.497" offset="9357354">Now, in applying the substantial interest test, it is our position that appellee is as interested or is substantially interested in the outcome of this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.267" offset="9420466">There can be no question that she is subjectively interested in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.097" offset="9435721">The facts bear that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.393" offset="9444916">She is also pecuniarily interested in the election in so far as her rent will be affected by any increase in the real property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.736" offset="9482324">She is also pecuniarily affected in so far as the money she pays and excise taxes will go if the city continues its present policy to the payment of the debt service on the general obligation bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.250" offset="9540420">All residence of the City of Phoenix are affected by the increase in any tax where sales tax or real property tax because it will increase generally the cost of goods and services within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.208" offset="9632162">Besides being interested both subjectively and pecuniarily, we also feel that the appellee is interested and has an objective state in the outcome of this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.437" offset="9685138">We wish to point out that in all bond elections the bond authorization is not the only question before the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.506" offset="9729442">There are other questions of political import in every bond election not just the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.341" offset="9764760">The location and type of the improvement to be made is an important aspect of each bond election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.123" offset="9803839">Obviously, I maybe induced to vote for the bond issue if they are going a place a school or library near my house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.845" offset="9842709">Conversely, I maybe induced to vote against the bond election if the city intends to place a sewer plant or abattoir in the direct vicinity of my house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.890" offset="9894954">This objective state is one that is shared by all residents of the city, not just by the real property taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.704" offset="9942183">In fact, this objective state is affected, affects those people who are excluded from this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.866" offset="9978859">For example, if you have residents of slums or tenements which are almost universally owned by absentee landlords and if this is a dense population of people, the political power of the ballot to induce the city to place the municipal improvements desired by those voting is completely wiped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.556" offset="10109576">I think one of the, one of the lessons of the election cases and voting rights cases and voting rights legislation that we've had over the past decade is the fact that the fruits of the election gravitate toward the political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.164" offset="10180002">Here, we have a situation which is basically unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.974" offset="10195257">A class of people are in a position where they cannot exercise any power to end and I might say and I will speak from past experience in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.972" offset="10255235">The general inclination on all bond elections is to have a purpose which will carry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.524" offset="10585422">Well, I'm arguing the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.318" offset="10592632">I have to say this, the footnote in the Kramer case seems to say that interest meant the intent to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.045" offset="10623561">Mr. Justice Stewart's dissent said that is what the Court is intending to do that the mere interest is an interest sufficient to take demand of the polls to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.635" offset="10665880">But I have tried to show that the interest of the tenant generally goes much further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.370" offset="10692838">The interest of the tenant is cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.414" offset="10700988">It is subjective, pecuniarily and objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.574" offset="10717706">Now, it also is I think of basic tenet of our civilization that the rent is going to be passed on to the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.058" offset="10759607">The appellant in the briefs state that the appellee is unique in this fashion, in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.946" offset="10795133">However, this Court in the very recent case of Turner versus Fouche stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.170" offset="10828048">“It cannot be seriously urged that the citizen in all other respects qualify to sit in the school board must own property if he has to participate responsively in the educational decisions without regard to whether he is among other things, a lessee who effectively pays property tax as part of his rent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.744" offset="10918327">I think the Court has noted what to me is a fact, a basic tenet of our capitalistic society that the landlord in order to get a fair return must pass on the real property taxes as a cost of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.991" offset="10979349">If the real property taxes go up, his rents are going to go up accordingly so he can keep his fair return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.939" offset="11055104">Now, another thing in this -- another point in this argument turns on the fact that there is not qualifica -- there is no quality, qualitative approach on the part of the State of Arizona or the City of Phoenix to determine just how much real property is necessary in order to allow the elector to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.376" offset="11164923">It is clear in my mind that so long as the man actively pays real property taxes, he may own one square inch of property then will be allowed to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.076" offset="11219675">A person leasing thousands of acres of property has no standing to vote in the same election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.152" offset="11244022">However, if we are talking about the mere tokenism of owning property, then we're in the situation which this Court condemned in Harper versus Virginia Board of Elections where it said that the test of wealth is not germaned to informity voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.950" offset="11355199">It is easy to draw an example where the owner of real property who would be allowed to vote could have a very small interest in the property that he owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.221" offset="11412250">If for example we have someone owning in $10.00 worth of taxable property at the assess level and we have B who owns, who leases a $10,000.00 home on the assess evaluation basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.328" offset="11472645">We have a situation where in one month, B is going to pay a bigger share of this -- of the debt incurred for these bonds that A will pay for the entire term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.015" offset="11523427">However, B will not be allowed to vote and A will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.915" offset="11538996">It might also be pointed out that as I said, one of the tenets of our society is that the entrepreneur takes the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.312" offset="11580583">The lessee of real property must live on property owned by somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.704" offset="11606183">If it's a corporation, the corporation can't vote; if it is a private source, the private source could vote if he lived within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.165" offset="11644008">However, one of the risks that this entrepreneur takes is the risk that he will have a tenant throughout the life of his building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.775" offset="11686431">In the event that taxes are to increase, this is part of the risk, so it's no grave imposition on the landed class to place to remove the restriction that only real property taxpayers may vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.248" offset="11792384">In our brief, we cited some examples and the only one that I wish to point out is the situation where under this particular type of statute, one person could own the entire municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.896" offset="11854973">No civic improvement could be made unless that one person agreed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.834" offset="11874722">Now, this is not exactly too farfetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.068" offset="11883604">In my in brief, I pointed out two examples one were two people carry, here the vote carry two to nothing, one where the vote was defeated by score of one to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.107" offset="11939819">We feel that the statute and the constitution of the State merely requires a token ownership of property and that the interest effected is in no way relative to the fact that the man owns property because you can pay more in a lease in a month than the owner of a small piece of property could pay throughout the life of the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.016" offset="12043473">Token as we feel should not be a constitutional distinction and yet that is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.241" offset="12072312">However, in the event it is shown that the appellee and her class are less interested than those who are allowed to vote, this does not carry the day for the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.270" offset="12132498">The appellant must also show that the interest, the state seeks to protect is compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.204" offset="12172204">I am at loss to know the appellants’ position on compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.287" offset="12196551">I have yet to learn the appellant’s position on the goal the state articulates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.927" offset="12219120">However, the amici briefs are some help in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.306" offset="12236570">The amici briefs boil this down to the protection of the land owner against the piling of indiscriminate debts by those who do not own the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.102" offset="12287770">We feel that the basic tenant of this type of articulated goal is mere protectionism against the way the population excluded might vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.995" offset="12351404">This same approach was denounced in Carrington versus Rash where the Court said, first the State says it has a legitimate interest in immunizing its elections from concentrated balloting of military personnel whose collective voice may overwhelm a small community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.370" offset="12432802">Fencing out from the franchise of a sector of the population because of the way they may vote is constitutionally impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.952" offset="12471150">The exercise of right is so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions cannot constitutionally be obliterated because of the fear of the political refuse of the group of residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.500" offset="12525380">I might note that the fencing out section was also sided in the Cipriano case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.900" offset="12562996">That concludes my delivery insofar as the test of the Kramer and Cipriano cases are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.328" offset="12604688">I feel a few words might necessary in relation to prospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.348" offset="12636766">It is the statement of the city that the date of the election should carry the day in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.570" offset="12669680">I feel that; one I feel if there is very little question in my own mind, personally that we do have a cut off date in Arizona; it is either the canvas date or the five day period thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.137" offset="12719940">Different attorneys as Mr. Lee has stated have read the Morgan case in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.035" offset="12747525">It is my feeling that there is a legitimate cut off date.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.488" offset="13269347">When the canvas passes and the authority to issue the bonds or in the alternative when the five day period passes, if that transpired before Cipriano, before the Cipriano decision, then in my mind those elections are valid and they would not be affected by the Cipriano decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.954" offset="13355238">On the contrary, if as in the City of Phoenix election the authorization was not complete because those are the words used in the last paragraph of Cipriano, the authorization was not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.869" offset="13418872">Then Cipriano would apply and if Cipriano did apply notwithstanding whatever cut off date, whether it would be canvas or five days after the canvas would have no application because we are not talking about a question for suit to the election.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.448" offset="13529213">I don’t really understand what Mr. Rosenfeld just said about whether there is or is not a cut off period, but I submit that my case is now made that there is a confusion on this point in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.658" offset="13574040">Now there certainly is at the very least serious question as to whether there is and we do not have the type of situation that exists in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.399" offset="13613014">Under those circumstances I simply reiterate my original position and that is, that the election is the thing that raises the constitutional question should be the election that should be the crucial date as of which any prospective decision, any question of prospectivity should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.082" offset="13691695">I simply reiterate that there is no question, that this does involve an extension of Kramer and Cipriano viewed in any way, whether you take the Kramer dictum or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.926" offset="13739029">I suggest to the Court that whether Kramer was a good decision or not in the first place, when you extend that compelling State interest test to real property owners in a general bond election, it involves the same kind of judicial intrusion into the traditional legislative field that this Court happily rejected in other fields in Nebbia versus New York, it should not be done.</text>
