            <label>Mr. Richard R. Lyman</label>
            <text syncTime="13.328" offset="156714">Mr. Chief Justice, honorable justices, this is a case which comes before this Court to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals below which partially reversed and partially affirmed a District Court judgment granting motions to dismiss a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.843" offset="282728">The plaintiffs in this case before employees of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad Company which is the railroad formed as the result of the merger of the former Erie Railroad and the former Delaware Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.886" offset="386905">That merger took place in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.170" offset="408012">And in 1962, the plaintiffs and the allegations to their complaint which of course control the facts where situation here were furloughed from their employment as stationary engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.505" offset="493380">They alleged in the complaint several different theories of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.357" offset="528802">They contend that that furlough being allegedly as a result of the merger of the railroads was the violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.005" offset="591391">They allege that it was a violation of the implementing agreement without specification as to what a implementing agreement provided for or what provisions were relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.957" offset="655235">They alleged that it was further violative of the Railway Labor Act and that they did not receive 30 days advance written notice of the fact that they were going to be furloughed.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.172" offset="720018">They alleged that they received no compensation for their severance from employment or severance pay to which they say they were entitled to by the Interstate Commerce Act and the implementing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.871" offset="794833">They assert that the furlough constituted a wrongful discharge because they were not subsequently recalled from the furlough or had not been up until the time of the suit which was filed in 1967, a predicate jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship and jurisdictional amounts on the Interstate Commerce Act Section 5 at sec and on the Railroad -- Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.647" offset="1017919">There was no specification of anything in the Interstate Commerce Act upon which they were relying to give rise to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.802" offset="1082598">The only specific jurisdictional allegation as to the Railway Labor Act was this 30 day notice provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.732" offset="1118333">And finally, in addition to all of these various allegations, they alleged that their union failed and refused to process the grievance and collect compensation for them after they had been furloughed or wrongfully discharged as the case maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.145" offset="1223973">And they say that this failure to process the grievance amounted to hostile discrimination, bad faith and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.771" offset="1282487">The District Court sustained the motions to dismiss that were filed by both defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.522" offset="1333478">Finding that there was no diversity of citizenship, the defendant Erie Lackawanna as a New York Corporation and the only union defendants were sued -- that were sued were also residents of the New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.338" offset="1400769">It found that there was no basis for such an action or for jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act and that they were not relying on any provision of that Act or claiming any provision of the statute had been violated and that the only thing they were basically suing on was the implementing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.331" offset="1516648">As to the Railway Labor Act, they said that the adjustment board had exclusive jurisdiction in the contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.263" offset="1560430">With respect to the charge that the union had failed to properly represent them, the District Court ruled that although the plaintiffs used the first hostile discrimination and alleging that they fail to process their claims properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.349" offset="1696789">Use of that phrase alone would not support jurisdiction under the Railway Labor Act as an unfair representation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.926" offset="1735032">And the District Court further pointed out that the plaintiffs were not attacking the validity of any collective bargaining agreement and they were not claiming that they could not personally pursue their administrative remedies to enforce a contract rights under that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.964" offset="1839208">After that ruling by the District Court, plaintiffs did not seek leave to file an amended complaint or attempt to file one but instead appeal from the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.157" offset="1907963">Thus, all we have in the record before the Court to support the factual questions involved are the complaint, they're too much to dismiss, plus so called affidavits that were filed with the District Court in connection with those motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.076" offset="2011721">The unions defendants, petitioners here, file a regular motion to dismiss the complaint based on lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter and failure to state a claim and filed no supporting affidavit, so that it was an ordinary motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.389" offset="2096880">The railroad's motion was supported by an affidavit of counsel which appears at page 12 of the appendix which did recite some facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.710" offset="2182248">On page 13, the second complete paragraph of the page states the railroads version of the facts out of which the dispute arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.913" offset="2247032">The plaintiffs filed -- the plaintiff's attorney files his own affidavit in our position to the motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.227" offset="2300322">Appearing on page 15 of the appendix and which he does not state any facts simply recites what he contend, what he contended the nature of the action to be and then recited and I quote “that the plaintiffs do not have to allege facts or damages in their complaint under the federal rules.”</text>
            <text syncTime="587.856" offset="2454758">Following this decision of the District Court, plaintiff's appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the complaint was sufficient to state a federal claim against the union defendants for breach of they duty of fairer representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.060" offset="2539604">But as to the railroad defendant, it sustained the District Court's dismissal of the complaint for the reason that plaintiffs had to assert there claim for wrongful discharge against the railroad exclusively before the National Railroad Adjustment Board and further sustain the District Court's other findings as to the lack of any substance and the various jurisdictional allegations to the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.438" offset="2889122">If an employee has an adequate administrative remedy, we contend that it must be resorted to and exhausted as -- or he must attempt to exhaust it or show that it would be futile to do so under the line of medics in Vaca against Sipes.</text>

            <label>Mr. James P. Shea</label>
            <text syncTime="1663.622" offset="6757857">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.650" offset="6773948">It would appear that the chief thrust of the petitioner's argument of course is against the sufficiency of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.112" offset="6807803">With that in mind to be very candid to the Court, the employee respondents here rely on this Court's prior decision in Conley versus Gibson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.968" offset="6859212">And on page 7 of our brief, we quote “what we believe to be the law of the United States related to the sufficiency of a complaint in the federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.713" offset="6918248">The Court indicated there that the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.346" offset="6992750">” Now, with this in mind, this is why I argued before the Circuit Court of Appeals in New York outside the record because there just isn't any record here outside the complaint and the affidavits of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.247" offset="7060355">And the reason I did argue to the Second Court of Appeals as to what I believe is the factual background and which has not been disputed as far as I know by any of the counsel here as to the factual background which underlies the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.291" offset="7144573">Now, the respondent employees were four former members of the Delaware Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad that had varying periods of the service with that railroad ranging from 47 years to 9 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.516" offset="7213432">Of course the merger took place in 1960 and these men were employed as stationary engineers in the city of Buffalo what was known as the Michigan Avenue Power Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.782" offset="7262542">They were laid off during the summer which was the usual procedure with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.627" offset="7293889">They were not called back to work for the fall season and the plant was closed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.263" offset="7328475">Now of course, when the merger took place between the two railroads, there was a merger, if you will of the unions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.330" offset="7368704">The employees were members of local 826 System Federation 78, counsel 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.924" offset="7411022">Now, they were stationary engineers and they supplied the steam to provide heat for the power plant and also provided heat for the trains as they come in for the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.174" offset="7468074">Erie Railroad built a new station, a new plant in the City of Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.484" offset="7501302">These four men, the respondent employees here as station engineers were not called back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.906" offset="7527006">Their jobs were replaced by four former employees of the Erie Railroad and these four former employees of the Erie Railroad were not stationary engineers but they were laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.433" offset="7597119">And it was the contention of the employees and they had made this know through again, this is after -- this is not in the record but I feel like we have to bring it to the Court's attention with the Court's permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.948" offset="7647169">They brought this situation to the attention of the master mechanic for the railroad and the union representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.867" offset="7686875">The answer that they received from both parties was that the -- they were not affected employees with respect to the merger, that the reason that they lost their jobs or to use the word furlough as the other counsel used it, was because of the obsolescence of this Michigan Avenue Power Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.623" offset="7781857">Now, in the lower courts and the District Court and then the Court of Appeals, both the attorneys for the union and the attorneys for the Railroad indicated that these men have not lost their jobs, that they were just furloughed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.553" offset="7837550">Of course this is almost 8 years later and they still called it a furlough, they don't call it a wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.124" offset="7879868">They did bring these -- they brought this attention of the situation to the master mechanic and the union representative as I indicated before, they got the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.594" offset="7925739">And was written to the president of the union and he said that the reason that you were given before by the general chairman of the local counsel was the sufficient reason as to why you do not have your job, and that's the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.136" offset="8003897">There were no forms given to the employees here as to start any kind of action before the National Railroad Adjustment Board, nothing of this sort, nothing was done at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.921" offset="8055097">Action was commenced in the Western District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.443" offset="8069099">A complaint was filed and summonses were served on certain of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.487" offset="8093341">It's the major contention of the employees here that this is a fair representation case against the union and that the National Railroad Adjustment Board under no decisions that I know of does not have jurisdiction over an unfair representation claim against the union alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.909" offset="8186964">My reading of cases in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, particularly the Cunningham case indicates that when a plaintiff has a claim against the union for unfair representation and also connected with that would have a wrongful discharge claim against the company that a better practice is not to disassociate the claims and make the plaintiff seek their relief in two different areas of law as it were but to let the employee plaintiff sue both people in the Federal District Court and it is my understanding of the Cunningham case as that what was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.406" offset="8400959">Judge Medina indicated that in a closely integrated action that this is the better practice and this is what should be done and this is what I argued to the Court of Appeals in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.471" offset="8445262">As to the argument of Mr. Lyman, relative to the company, the Railroad should not be led off, I agree but I think that the Court of Appeals in its opinion left the employees with and out as it were because they allowed us to amend our complaint if we could against the union, against the company, excuse me, alleging that if it wasn't -- not collusion but at least some kind of test that's understanding between the two defendants as to these job replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.023" offset="8623417">Because, again, this is not in the record but the employees would attempt to prove that there was some kind of an agreement between the company and the union as represented by stronger people from the former Erie Railroad that there was some kind of agreement as to these four jobs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard F. Griffin</label>
            <text syncTime="2893.916" offset="11679013">Well, If I knew that the union in its brief did not suggest that this Court should make some adverse determination and maybe keep us in the lawsuit, then as far as that part of it, I wouldn't be here and I think that it's quite clear that we shouldn't be in the lawsuit and as I think Justice White developed in the question, this employee had all the chance in the world to go before the adjustment board, his counsel for years, his counsel decided not to go to the adjustment board and that was -- he had every opportunity in the world, there was nothing to prevent him but he didn't want to go there and this Court has consistently held that the Railway Labor Act provides exclusive remedy and has an obligation to go there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.328" offset="11888724">Now, Mr. Shea and I just will conclude with this went outside the record to argue about the merits of the case and I think I have to respond in this respect that he says that the Erie Railroad hired old employees of Erie that the merge railroad hired old employees to run a new power plant after the one power plant was closed down in Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.041" offset="11983496">Well, that's not a fact and it's not for you to decide whether or not it's a fact but he's gone into it and he never before put this in and they didn't build a new power station and hired new people because in Buffalo, the old Lackawanna had one of these great huge stations that you couldn't give away for years, finally it was sold for taxes or something and the power plant that he did it and so on came to an end and that's where these men worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.472" offset="12101256">For the limited time that there was passenger service, there was a source of steam elsewhere in Buffalo that was used and they didn't build a new power plant as Mr. Shea suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.037" offset="12155486">And accordingly, that's why all along they took the position that their jobs came to an end due to a railroad obsolescence, that the merger had nothing to do with it and accordingly that there's no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.253" offset="12208358">And I think that that's what the Railroad Adjustment Board would hold, that there's no political discrimination, there's nothing in this case and that's why there's never been anything set forth in the pleadings because they don't have anything to set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.391" offset="12256946">In the Glover's case where there was a futility question, the counsel went in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.782" offset="12278471">And so in conclusion, it's our position very basically that the District Court was correct in dismissing this case 100% as against the defendant Erie Lackawanna, we feel that's where we should be.</text>
