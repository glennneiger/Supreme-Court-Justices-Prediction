            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="40.481" offset="161855">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.955" offset="175752">This case brings to this Court for the fifth time, questions under the Great Meatpackers antitrust decree of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.893" offset="207517">That decree was entered on consent without a trial on the basis of a bill in equity that the Government had brought against the nation’s five largest meatpackers, Swift, Wilson, Cudahy, Armour which is involved in this case and Morris which Armour subsequently acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.350" offset="281391">The complaint in general charged that the packers had violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by obtaining control of a very great proportion of the food supply of the nation, both meat and other foods, and by abusing that control so as to restrict competition among themselves and to eliminate their other competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.673" offset="366655">The consent decree that the parties agreed upon in 1920 and that the Court adopted imposed sweeping and perpetual restraints both upon the future activities of the packers and upon the business relationships that the packers would be allowed to have with enterprises engaged in the production and sale of foods other than meat.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.227" offset="452859">And despite the efforts of the defendants over the years to relax these restrictions, they remain in effect and this Court most recently in 1961 rejected an attempt by the packers to relax the restrictions upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.225" offset="516807">The decree is complex and I will take the time here only to discuss the particular paragraphs that are in issue in this case, that’s principally paragraph fourth of the decree which begins on page 30 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.485" offset="581904">That paragraph provides that the meatpacker corporations, including of course Armour, are perpetually enjoined and restrained from either directly or indirectly by themselves or through their officers, directors, agents, or servants engaging in or carrying on the manufacturing, jobbing, selling, transporting except this common carriers, distributing or otherwise dealing in some 114 listed food products, including bakery products, most of it groceries, vegetables and fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.243" offset="700918">Paragraph four goes on to provide that the corporation defendants are hereby further perpetually enjoined and restrained from owning either directly or indirectly severally or jointly by themselves or through their officers, directors, agents, or servants from owning any capital stock or other interest whatsoever in any corporation, firm or association except common carriers which is in the same business as what I mentioned, of manufacturing, jobbing, selling, transporting, distributing or otherwise dealing in any of the above described products or commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.185" offset="844696">Paragraph six of the decree further perpetually enjoins the defendants from operating retail meat markets and paragraph eight enjoins the packers from dealing directly or indirectly in fresh milk and cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.155" offset="904568">In short, the meatpacker's decree perpetually excludes Armour from having any direct or indirect interest whatsoever in any firm in the baking or general grocery business and it prohibits Armour from otherwise dealing directly or indirectly in the enumerated products.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.034" offset="976039">The decree as what is commonly referred to as the structural decree that is rather than simply enjoining the defendants from particular anti competitive acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.853" offset="1027344">It establishes a prophylactic separation between the defendants' business, excluding them from other businesses where it's felt that they're involvement and might create a danger competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.227" offset="1084813">General Host, which is the appellee in this case is the company that's widely involved in the baking business and the general grocery and restaurant businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.693" offset="1122743">It was known until a couple of years ago as General Baking Company and under the brand name Bun Baking Company and others that manufactures and sells throughout the country a complete line of bread and other bakery products.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.521" offset="1181989">It also has a division called Little General Stores which has some 380 convenience retail food markets in various parts of the south and it also has subsidiaries that operate restaurants and other tourist facilities throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.694" offset="1250743">It's plain and undisputed in this case that General Host's business is such that under the 1920 decree Armour could not have acquired any direct or indirect ownership interest whatsoever in General Host.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.512" offset="1318034">This litigation began about a year ago when General Host decided to do the reverse of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.298" offset="1341127">It would take over Armour by acquisition techniques that have become familiar in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.133" offset="1368503">Over the opposition of Armour's management, General Host made a tender offer to Armour's stockholders in which had sought to acquire a majority of Armour stock in return for package of the debentures and the stock warrants in General Host.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.158" offset="1444571">The tender offer was expressly conditioned upon the tender by shareholders of enough stock to give General Host an absolute majority of Armour stock and it provided that it will called off if that amount of stock were not tendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.448" offset="1501727">When the tender offer was made, the Government immediately sought to block this takeover on the theory that a corporate alliance between Armour's meatpacking business and General Host's bakery and retail grocery businesses would be just as inconsistent with the meatpacker's decree if initiated by General Host as it would have been if initiated by Armour.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.763" offset="1583020">It was plain of course that General Host's acquisition of Armour would not be directly punishable under the decree since the active party, General Host, was not a party to that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.748" offset="1626906">Accordingly, the Government went to the District Court in Chicago which has had continuing jurisdiction at least in the recent years over the meatpacker's decree and there the Government requested a supplemental order to prohibit the takeover by General Host.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.110" offset="1700362">It did this consistent with paragraph 18 of the decree which like most decrees expressly retains jurisdiction for the purpose of taking such other action or adding to the foot of this decree such other relief if any as it may become necessary or appropriate for the carrying out in enforcement of this decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.683" offset="1990635">In other words, we're not -- the Government's theory of the case to approach it in another way has not been based upon any sort of change in facts other than of course the undisputed facts it takes.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.774" offset="2035043">What if you -- if you accepted the fact that the purpose of the decree was to prohibit an alliance of any kind between the Armour entity and any of the other described entities then it wouldn't make much difference whether you amended it or just interpreted it, would it?</text>

            <text syncTime="529.579" offset="2118217">No I think not, and of course I could make further observation that it seems a little strange and inconsistent with traditional equitable theories for a decree to say nobody in the world shall takeover this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.684" offset="2170671">That's an unusual form and that the least for decree and of course it doesn't have any operative effect in the normal sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.673" offset="2238589">Yes, but what we say -- I was just addressing myself to the question of whether the presence or absence of such language in a decree would make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.564" offset="2274220">We say and I will elaborate that substantively this decree established a separation between these two businesses and the establishment of that separation as a substantive matter is frustrated by this kind of takeover.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="671.081" offset="2684238">I believe that its predecessor General Baking Company I think it was incorporated in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.607" offset="2710361">Of course it had no connection whatever with these packers and there was no reason for the Government even to think about bringing it in or foreseeing what might happen in a very different kind of business climate some 50 years later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.539" offset="2802103">Judge Hoffman in the District Court of Chicago of course denied the Government's petition to add General Host as a party and to add an order to the decree prohibiting the takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.532" offset="2866051">He relied quite simply on the proposition as I read what he said that the literal terms of the decree do not prohibit non-defendant owners of stock in meat packing companies from engaging in businesses prohibited to meatpackers themselves and by the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.621" offset="2926446">In other words, as he explained orally, that the decisive fact in the case was that Armour will not be the controlling force whether the instrumentality of General Host is ever since villain of the peace and that's the term he used, it was not Armour but General Host, the decree was powerless, the decree could not be used to prevent the takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.190" offset="3020696">If Judge Hoffman's rather scanty conclusions of law rests on the proposition that he did not have jurisdictional power to supplement the decree in this kind of way, we think he was plainly wrong, for the reasons that we set out in our brief which I believe are not basically disputed by the appellees.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.777" offset="3179102">There's a certain amount of back and forth I think within General Host's [Voice Overlap] briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.824" offset="3211285">So, I will direct my point only to the proposition that the structural prohibitions of this decree are frustrated, in some sense violated by this takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.122" offset="3264470">And I think General Host does, in the last analysis, agree that if that's the case then the Court could and indeed should have granted the relief requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.236" offset="3308878">I think this perhaps the problem as I suggested in this case is a semantic one basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.956" offset="3335732">The basis for our whole case is the proposition that the decree is violated or frustrated because the takeover creates the situation that the decree was designed specifically to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.316" offset="3389231">General Host and the court below as I understand them say that can't be so because nobody has disobeyed the command that the decree directed to them because, the decree does not in terms prescribed Armour's acquisition by a grocery company.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.133" offset="3464464">We think that's much too narrow reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.037" offset="3480137">Of course the decree is not -- a civil decree is not punitive document and it obviously does affect people other than the particular individuals who happened to be accused of wrong doing at the time the decree was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.250" offset="3548996">So, I think it's not shocking or unusual the decree should affect parties in the business sense, people other than the initial parties to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.728" offset="3590896">We think in fact the literal language of the decree condemns precisely the situation that has been created by the takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.634" offset="3630498">Paragraph four not only prohibits Armour from indirectly engaging in General Host's business, but even more specifically, it prohibits Armour from having directly or indirectly any capital stock or other interest whatsoever in General Host or in General Host subsidiaries that are engaged in the businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.755" offset="3710955">It seems to me extremely literalistic to say that when Armour is the subsidiary of General Host, it has no interest whatsoever either in General Host's business or in the business of General -- its sister subsidiaries of General Host.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.019" offset="3780023">Certainly, as I suggested, this conclusion seems not difficult to reach if this kind of situation arose by actions in which Armour or its management joined or perhaps even instigated and equally I think it would not seem troublesome to say that the decree which prohibit a situation where Armour or its stockholders or management or dissident stockholders through proxy provider or something like that created a holding company which then had two subsidiaries, one of them being the old Armour and the other being General Host.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.932" offset="3963716">To put it in other way, the situation we now have is if one corporation that directly or indirectly is in both businesses, the meatpacking business and the grocery business and that corporation is General Host, directly in the grocery business and it's indirectly in the meatpacking business through its controlled subsidiary Armour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.658" offset="4058593">And we think that that is just precisely what the structural provisions of the decree prohibited and in fact the only reason why there would have been structural provisions in the decree is to prevent that kind of situation from arising.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.969" offset="4491807">It has been twice, well three times there are some current efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.109" offset="4524408">In the early 30s meatpackers tried to modify it to relieve them of just these restrictions on their involvement in the grocery business and they had another effort beginning in the late 50s which ended in 1961 when this Court summarily affirmed the District Court's determination that the packers had not made the kind of showing that would be required to justify a modification of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.727" offset="4642900">So, the decree, though it's old, has been in the sense revivified within relatively recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.347" offset="4677381">We think it's highly pertinent to the problem here what the Courts said in considering these earlier requests for modification because we think that the language the Courts used and analysis this Court and the District Court followed in those cases gives rather explicit content to the substantive prohibitions and shows what their specific purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.770" offset="4802978">In 1932, Justice Cardozo speaking for the Court in the second Swift case in this Court rejected, as I said, contentions that the market had changed that the wrong doers were not in the picture anymore and therefore it was not necessary to maintain this separation between the grocery business and the meatpackers business and the Court used the following language which I think is revealing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.217" offset="4928784">Whether the defendants would resume their predatory practices if they were to deal in groceries again, we do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.280" offset="4953025">They would certainly have the temptation to reason with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.893" offset="4963474">Their low overhead and their gigantic size even when they are viewed as separate units would still put them in a position to starve out weaker rivals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.156" offset="4996598">Their size according to the holding in this Court is not an offense against the Sherman Act unless maybe to the point at which it amounts to monopoly, but size carries with it an opportunity for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.103" offset="5036408">It is not to be ignored when the opportunity is proved to be utilized in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.389" offset="5053544">The original decree at all events was framed upon that theory and Justice Cardozo went on to say that if the grocery business is added to the meat business, there may be many instances of unfair pressure upon retailers and others with the design of forcing them to buy from the defendants and not from the rival groceries, such at any rate was the rationale of the decree of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.048" offset="5144137">Its restraints whether just or excessive were born of that fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.385" offset="5161482">The difficulty of fretting out these evils and repressing them when discovered supplies an additional reason why the structural restriction should be maintained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.276" offset="5341100">The point I was driving at was not that as a general proposition the combination of a large packer and a meat company is a bad thing, but that this Court has read this very decree which has a party to it Armour as embodying a specific purpose to prevent that kind of addition of the grocery business to Armour's meatpacking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.552" offset="5478191">And for that reason, we think that the Government should have not to start from scratch and having been specifically decreed that Armour's business should not be combined with the grocery business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.324" offset="5537228">And none of the past history, language the Court have used is there any suggestion that the importance of this separation depends upon who threatens to break it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.407" offset="5581531">The reason for the separation is plainly the danger of any corporate link however created between Armour's large size and power which of course when General Host owns and controls Armour in a very real sense becomes the power that General Host has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.074" offset="5668258">Certainly, there are separate corporate entities, but I find it very hard in my mind to say that when General Host wholly or in the sense of absolute control owns Armour that General Host is not Armour in some very meaningful sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.853" offset="5751327">The ultimate owners are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.976" offset="5759896">Armour's destiny is controlled by General Host.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.549" offset="5774106">So, I think that apart from the conceptual fact that there are separate corporate shells, if you will, Armour is in a very real sense or has become General Host.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.261" offset="5828963">General Host is -- Armour has the power that the decree was specifically designed to keep Armour from using in a business which is General Host's business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.650" offset="6966544">I don't know, Your Honor, whether the department could intervene, I believe it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.177" offset="6988696">They intervened in railroad mergers and I don't know why they couldn't intervene in the case, in a situation like this, but even if they couldn't intervene, they certainly could make their view known as amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.367" offset="7061420">Now, I was delighted to hear Mr. Springer say that there's no issue as to the power of the Court here to whether the Court has the power to protect its decrees from interference or obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.818" offset="7151177">As I read the Government's brief in this case, I thought that this was their major point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.472" offset="7177822">And that the case has now become what I think it was all along, a question as to whether or not this decree as it now stands can be interpreted to prevent this transaction and if it can be so interpreted what type of hearing is General Host entitled to before that interpretation is imposed on General Host.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.482" offset="7313868">What the department did in this case was merely to go to the District Court, file an affidavit and say General Host is in the baking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.306" offset="7373218">The baking business is proscribed to Armour, therefore, you must proscribe this transaction and we don't think the only hearing that they thought was necessary was to show that General Host was in the baking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.925" offset="7463602">Now, I think it's somewhat shocking for the Department of Justice to take the position that a person who is not a party to an equity decree was never been heard on that decree, who was not joined at the time of the decree although it was in existence at the time the action was maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.197" offset="7608738">It's bound by the decree without proof of anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.028" offset="7624098">It seems to me that under any circumstances even assuming that the department's interpretation of the decree is right, the General Host is entitled to a hearing on whether or not it should be bound by the decree because I don't believe that two parties to a lawsuit with the imprimatur of the Court can deprive anybody obvious legal rights and one of the basic legal rights that a person seems to have is the right to due process, the right to be heard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2308.119" offset="9232405">If you look at the decree as in this writ, the decree was very, very carefully framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.748" offset="9262916">And it is not a structural decree per se as Mr. Springer would have you believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.554" offset="9294158">There are many behavioral, behavioral provisions in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.496" offset="9317982">There were three types of defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.978" offset="9347866">There were the meatpacker defendants, there were individual defendants who are the major stockholders in the meat companies and there were some 50 subsidiaries of the meat companies who were defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.092" offset="9416307">This was a -- there were quite a few defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.024" offset="9432085">Now, when the consent decree was negotiated, these various defendants were given different types of treatment, the provision that Mr. Springer referred to, two of them, four and eight specifically referred to corporate defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.630" offset="9530514">Paragraph six which is another one that he referred to applies to all defendants and paragraph five of the decree applies to individual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.763" offset="9598955">Now, in paragraph five of the decree, the individual defendants, the people who were then in control of the meatpackers were permitted to own stock in the forbidden businesses, the businesses forbidden to the meatpackers and they were permitted to own up to 50% of the stock, no question to control this as this Court well knows that you can control a company with much less than 50% of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.808" offset="9763213">These companies were permitted to engage in these forbidden businesses and there was an injunctive provision which says, but you can't use them in a way that would help either Armour in its business or yourself or use Armour in a way to help you in your business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.542" offset="9870106">So, that this decree did not declare a complete separation as the Government says of the business of meatpacking from substitute foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.877" offset="9915455">It said only this, that the defendant meatpackers, the defendant meatpackers and that is the way that the language of the decree is, the packer defendants, corporate defendants, are enjoined from doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.428" offset="10001659">So that it seems to me that you can't characterize this decree as a prophylactic structural decree, but this is a decree that was arrived at by negotiation and it was some structure and some behavioral and the parties knew exactly what they were doing and they did not intend to reach the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.548" offset="10118165">Maybe they weren't aware of it, maybe it didn't occur to them, but obviously they didn't intend either sub silentio or actually to reach the situation that is covered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.670" offset="10178664">So that, in effect what the department is seeking here is a modification of the decree as Mr. Justice White indicated and I might add here that the department has construed this decree in the past the same way that we're construing it now because they have -- one of the provisions of the decree prohibits the packers from engaging in the stockyard business, but the people who controlled Armour before General Host acquired the control of Armour also controlled the Chicago stockyards, this is all set out in our briefs.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="2925.350" offset="11701394">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.901" offset="11715500">Perhaps I should correct something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.175" offset="11720620">I may have slightly misstated in answer to a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.845" offset="11739324">Of course, we think what we're asking for here is very different from any hypothetical general amendment of this decree to try to make it run against the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.858" offset="11787389">We of course agree that the decree can't run against the world and that is precisely why we haven't contended and wouldn't contend that General Host has done anything that would subject it to punishment for contempt of this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.740" offset="11850919">The Government filed a petition, gave General Host the opportunity to have a hearing and to bring in anything they wanted to bring in on the issue whether or not it's proper that this decree should give rise to a new order directed directly to General Host which then of course would subject it to contempt punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.179" offset="11948617">So, we don't see that there's any issue of due process in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.959" offset="11967739">General Host has had a hearing and the only issue was what ought to be said at that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.732" offset="12002847">If Mr. Bergson is asserting the proposition that it is only parties who are in direct active concert with the parties to a decree who in any way can be effected by the decree, I think for one thing he is suggesting a doctrine which is inconsistent with what appears to be accepted doctrine and specifically in the civil rights area where this has come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.404" offset="12121548">The simple fact that a man who comes in and tries to frustrate the performance of a school desegregation decree is not working together with the school board against whom that decree in terms was directed has never been a barrier for a supplemental order very much like kind of supplemental order we're asking for here against a particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.148" offset="12244532">Although Mr. Bergson acknowledges that decree, and we don't disagree with him, contains both behavioral provisions and structural restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.989" offset="12295941">He then turns around as I understand his argument and treats the decree as if it contained nothing but behavioral prohibitions. For that reason we think it's -- we think that's wrong and we think that that's really beside the point to argue again and again that this decree could not possibly affect General Host because no Court has ever determined that General Host had done anything bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.707" offset="12402730">I think that argument in substance was rejected in the earlier modification proceedings in this case where a similar argument was made that that the bad people who made Armour do bad things in the past and made the other packers do bad things aren't here anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.207" offset="12468767">Now, we just have a new set of stockholders and the management who are totally innocent and of course they shouldn't be bound by past wrong doings of other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.710" offset="12502831">I think that's really beside of the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.717" offset="12530834">One other matter, I think, any suggestion that the fact that this decree contains a paragraph which relates to what might be done by particular individuals none of whom by himself was a controlling stockholder, at least in the case of Armour I believe, to say that that is the means that -- nor the part of the decree has any bearing on interlocking corporate interest, I think simply doesn't follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.885" offset="12663536">I think the problem of the individual defendants in 1920 was a relatively small, separate problem and that to say that that precludes the Government to take any action against what might be a 100% owned, 100% owning corporate stockholder, I think doesn't follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.494" offset="12761966">Again, for that same reason, we think that any attempt to say that the Government is bound because it did not take any action against the Prince Family problem is erroneous for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.838" offset="12847334">That was in the matter of an individual stock ownership at the most I believe by an amalgamation of people who are various members of the Prince Family, various people who are said perhaps to have some kind of relationship with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.377" offset="12929463">General Host has managed to reach a total of perhaps 13% from stock ownership in Armour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.686" offset="12958720">Here where the dealing with absolute corporate control by another corporation and of course, also this is not a matter of past course of action between these two parties about this subject matter, but the collateral matter in those returns.</text>
