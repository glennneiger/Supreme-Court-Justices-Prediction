            <text syncTime="69.541" offset="381576">New York City, (Inaudible) which is comprised is the only jurisdiction in this country that denies to its citizens a right to jury trial for a crime punishable by as much as one-year imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.870" offset="442807">Indeed in the remaining 57 counties in the State of New York, a person is entitled to a jury trial of six requiring unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.688" offset="490141">Thus the question which this case brings to this Court whether Section 40 of the New York City Criminal Code Act set forth at pages 3 and 4 of our brief violates the Sixth Amendment as applied to the states in the Fourteenth in denying jury trial for what we deem to be a serious offense and also in view of the provision for jury trial elsewhere in the State of New York whether the Equal Protection Clause is so violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.496" offset="617305">The records of facts in this case are relatively simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.586" offset="729736">Well, no Your Honor, I'm saying that where the state has undertaken to provide most of its citizenry apart from one city with the right to jury trial given what this Court has said in Duncan about the importance of right to jury trial as provided by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.474" offset="805282">Indeed in the deciding Duncan, this Court looked to the states to see how important that right was and they found that it was applied and provided for in all the states.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="187.924" offset="855019">Well, I was really just pushing your argument one step beyond that that once you have a fixed cutoff time in one state, the citizens of every other state which does not comply with that favorably is involved in an equal protection problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.724" offset="930252">Well, that now I misunderstood Your Honor's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.834" offset="942686">If that's all that's involved then there is no problem there because if New York is the only state which, New York City indeed, was the only state which has a problem that is before this Court namely right to a jury trial for a year then we don't have to equalize anything among the other states because this Court has already decided that a six-month period of time on an offense is petty and since all the other states do not deprive anybody of a jury trial for a years a time then there is no equalization required between New York and the rest of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.795" offset="1082598">There is equalization required between New York City and the rest of the state, but I would like to get to the equal protection argument a bit later.</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="255.111" offset="1123767">The record -- the facts were essentially very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.086" offset="1131708">This defendant, appellant was convicted after a one-judge bench trial for the crime of jostling and sentenced to one-year imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.036" offset="1167548">The evidence in the case was that he was observed with his co-defendant crowding a woman on an escalator and the (Inaudible) terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.374" offset="1204851">The arresting officer said that he saw defendant take either a loose cash, money from the woman's handbag or a $10 bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.265" offset="1244453">A motion for a jury trial was made in the criminal court and it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.858" offset="1262843">The New York Court of Appeals by majority decision, five to two felt that this Court's decision in Duncan did not require a holding that one-year was a serious crime nor did it require any different holding on equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.240" offset="1328358">The justices who dissented, Justice Burke and Keating took a much different view and of course it's much more consonant with our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.409" offset="1365034">Essentially, our Sixth Amendment argument is really broken down to three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.853" offset="1390738">We think that although Duncan did not decide this question, the thrust of Duncan, the logic of Duncan resolves the issue for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.771" offset="1434415">However, we also feel that if Your Honors would accredit New York's looking at its own historical experience to deprive the appellant of a jury trial that even under what we concede to be erroneous criteria, our argument still prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.574" offset="1497631">And the people had misunderstood our argument on this point because they seem to say in their brief that we offer to the Court as an affirmative indication of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.047" offset="1543607">We are saying that if we will force to it, we can win our case even under the criteria of New York Court of Appeals followed, even though we think its broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.522" offset="1577462">Thirdly, I think perhaps the ghost in the closet on this case has to be the question of the impact of the Court's decision on the criminal court, the problem in New York City because I really believe if this case had come from Casanovia, or people -- as the people would have it, this would not be a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.579" offset="1657710">Now, although the New York Court of Appeals spoke of the problems of New York criminal court on the equal protection issue, I can't help but feel and I would like to come to grips with that, end of the argument on Sixth Amendment lurking behind the problem this Court faces is the problem of the calendar chaos in New York criminal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.898" offset="1734928">Hence, looking towards the decision in Duncan, as I read the opinion, the Court looked to what it called the objective criteria, chiefly the existing laws and the practices of the nation to decide whether Louisiana's assault statute requiring a two year maximum of imprisonment was a serious or petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.726" offset="1834297">Looking to national criteria, the Court found that nowhere else in the land was a two-year of sentence of countenance without a right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.051" offset="1879542">Applying that method of analysis, the Court would arrive at the same conclusion with respect to New York City, namely that nowhere else in the land does the situation prevail in which a defendant faced with one-year imprisonment is denied a right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.880" offset="1946937">So Section 4 --</text>

            <text syncTime="461.083" offset="1947669">How about the other states that gave a jury trial and the one-year, it must have been the type of the case and had (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="476.087" offset="2007751">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.373" offset="2012871">I think Mr. Justice Harlan you are getting to what the people -- I think hang their case on, I might say, namely that our position depends on whether we are entitled to a common law jury or not and I think that this is an error for the same reason that it was an error or at least a relevant decision in Duncan.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.373" offset="2092910">Primarily in Duncan, the Court, I think Mr. Justice Fortas in his concurring opinion in Bloom, Mr. Justice White's footnote, Mr. Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion all discussed whether the entire bag and baggage of the Sixth Amendment must come with the Duncan decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.645" offset="2161977">It's a question left opened in the Duncan.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.318" offset="2172635">The unanimous jury, the twelve-man jury, I think again that this is a question left open in this case and which -- one which we need not resolve because all and I think in depending on Duncan that we are asking for is some form a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.080" offset="2251734">For instance in Louisiana after Duncan, the jury trial which is now provided is not a common law. Unanimous jury, is a five man jury for the one-year crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.047" offset="2295515">What Louisiana did is they knocked a lot of crime down to six months and for the ones that were over, they provided a five man jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.960" offset="2319235">I don't think the record in this case nor the issue on this case has to depend on whether a Sixth Amendment jury with all its bag and baggage is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.163" offset="2368031">What the New York Court of Appeals did therefore is they looked away from Duncan and at least read Duncan to authorize looking to its own historical experience, namely that in New York we have always considered a misdemeanor a petty offense and a felony a serious offense and that one-year decided which was which?</text>
            <text syncTime="591.476" offset="2469282">But the six-months cutoff nation with -- nationwide and even historically has much more support with respect to the issue of the jury trial than does the one-year cutoff upon which the people and the New York Court of Appeals based their opinion.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="606.158" offset="2528005">Well, if we adopted your argument, this would preclude the idea of any states cutting back if -- as they had find juries, jury trials more difficult to administer?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="615.734" stopTime="682.499">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="615.734" offset="2566353">I think Your Honor, it would preclude the state from denying a jury trial for anything more than a six-month period of imprisonment unless of course the Court upon reconsideration of a decision, it could be forthcoming in this case and in Duncan, might -- would reconsider on a full record what the problem warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.255" offset="2652348">I think that its interesting in the people's brief, they attempt to call the Court's attention to the Minnesota experience with requiring a jury trial in a certain lesser crime situations by showing that there were delays that will result in.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.061" offset="2711594">Their brief doesn't reflect however the next two lines of the Minnesota Law Review Article which also discloses that the Bar Association of Minnesota in a response to the delay and the question of whether the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court should remain in Vivo, recommend it that it was much more important to retain the jury system than to just disregard it as a result of some momentary shortage of space and the facility but I'd get to that again later.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.783" offset="2838549">The sixth month cutoff has historical significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.878" offset="2858924">This Court in the Duncan mentioned the fact that for the most part in the 18th Century, the six-month cutoff with exceptions was a general experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.082" offset="2911692">Also, the reason why New York's experience doesn't really help is that New York's experience was not the only type of experience the colonies had had.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.112" offset="2955786">New York, New Jersey as late Justice Frankfurter in his article -- Mr. Cockrin point out are much harsher than the denial of trial by a jury than many of the other colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.119" offset="3011897">So an attempt to locate in history exactly what's at stake is not really a fruitful thing but I think we've got the better of it in terms of the fact that there were and more lenient, there were more lenient policies in the colony.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.952" offset="3067173">I think its interesting that to note that at least two commentators, Professor Herbal in our brief think that the New York's denial of jury trial in serious and in petty offenses or serious offenses depending on where you place the label has something to do with the aristocratic structure of the colony.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.746" offset="3146376">I view the New York experience, although we affirmed consistently over the years by the Court, sort of a vestige of this old colonial policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.143" offset="3195904">The dissenting opinion as we do took the position that you couldn't tell even if you cannot look to the New York experience that the citizens of New York had not opted, had not felt that over six months was a serious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.666" offset="3266017">For the reason that the legislature had given a jury trial elsewhere in the state and that in the recent constitutional convention, the elected representatives of the people drafted the constitution with a new provision which this Court called attention to in Duncan that would've limited the denial of the jury trial to a six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.413" offset="3341040">Of course the constitution was defeated as a matter of -- it was a package deal, nothing to do, I don't believe, I'm almost certain with the jury trial provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.589" offset="3381687">So I don't think the New York Court of Appeals is right in saying that New York citizenry does not view a one-year sentence as a serious crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="914.860" offset="3762761">The people have attempted to draw Your Honors' attention in their brief, I think that superficially, it has a lot of attractiveness but I think down deep, it really doesn't cut too deeply by trying to convince you that one-year as cutoff really has a lot of sense, a lot of historical sense in our national history.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.264" offset="3860459">But the one-year cutoff which they refer to really is a felony-misdemeanor distinction that goes to such things as the right to jury trial -- a right to indictment for this crime, the collateral effect of the conviction of a misdemeanor distinguished from a felony and the place of incarceration with respect to the both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.442" offset="3949171">But it's interesting that this one-year distinction that they attempt to draw is not a distinction as drawn by any state except New York with respect to the right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.747" offset="3986369">For example, California still draws the distinction between felony and misdemeanor as a one-year crime in terms of who goes to what prison, but with respect to the jury trial, a common law jury is provided in California for traffic offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.649" offset="4062020">So the one-year distinction as to the felony and misdemeanor really doesn't answer anything and combined with what I think to be a much more sensible and stronger historical six-month position really wipes itself out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.222" offset="4160240">I -- maybe I chose the wrong word Mr. Chief Justice, sensible to me means logically consistent with your prior decisions and I think what I'm suggesting here is logically consistent with the language and the thrust of Duncan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.596" offset="4205798">The commentators who have analyzed Duncan have so read it and those are authorities cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.251" offset="4232338">I think since Duncan looked to the nation as a whole and said, “Let us see what they are doing in the other states” that that issue was resolved and the only thing that was left hanging was the New York situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.793" offset="4298585">The right to -- also to attempt to tie the one-year serious-petty to the incidence of the right to indictment can't work very well either because only eight states in this country guarantee the right to indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.560" offset="4357622">Now most states which guarantee the right to jury trial which was set forth in our appendix don't really care about indictment and I would presume to say that if I thought there was one provision of the Bill of Rights that would probably not be incorporated apart from the Second Amendment would have to be the right to indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.269" offset="4440482">Scholarship, the literature on the subject is against grand jury indictment rather than before and I think if any of the old cases perhaps has some longevity, it would be Hurtado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.003" offset="4491368">Also the place of confinement in that 22 states as adversary recites, “Send their felons to state prison while misdemeanants go to county jail.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.440" offset="4541106">I don't think there was any analytical words Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.011" offset="4555421">Mainly because its only 22 states, but historically, this distinction arises out of concepts of infamy, concepts of finance, why should the local administration have to bear the cost of a serious felon where the state could take a more proper interest and indeed in New York, one of the blunders of the penal law even with its recent modification, is that felons can go to the county jail as we call the New York City penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.642" offset="4681958">This is something the legislature would like to resolve, but right now, and as a matter of practice felons do go to Rikers Island which is the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.128" offset="4715917">So what -- you really don't as I see it get much mileage out of the distinction that has been drawn by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.364" offset="4752802">The collateral effect are also time tried and historical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.826" offset="4766699">A felon loses his right to vote in most states, in New York, right to public office, loss of civil right is a board category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.394" offset="4796897">The misdemeanant, all he loses his possible right to livelihood, housing, employment, certain occupations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.379" offset="4836916">The majority of the New York Court of Appeals thought this were not very important compared to the right to vote and the right to public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.280" offset="4872443">I think given the nature of the New York City criminal population, those people who faced with the misdemeanor conviction, loss of the misdemeanor collateral effect -- collateral consequences are much more severe and I would think certainly neutralized the Court of Appeals emphasis on the felony collateral effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.635" offset="4957915">I think the most difficult part of the case in terms of psychology of it in both below and perhaps here, is what the Court conceives of is probably New York City criminal court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.651" offset="5005981">New York City criminal court is in chaos and it has been in chaos for a long time to the extent, I don't know how I could convey to you the feeling I would like to if I could take you through our courthouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.327" offset="5052688">I've tried to document -- I would not dare make the claims I have made in my brief without documentation of what it is like, what the process of justice has become in our criminal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.819" offset="5102634">The turnstile feeling, the feeling by the minority population which participates very heavily in the criminal court or what it is like to have a judge to being a part and watch a judge decide his fifteenth case of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.707" offset="5166164">The jury trial, the right to jury trial was meant I think by this Court, understood by this Court to protect a defendant against a judge for whatever the reasons maybe, from being casehardened, from being worn down by the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.376" offset="5244844">And the burdens the court as we've pointed out with the addition of new judges as we assumed the elimination of three-judge court would not create much more difficulty if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.474" offset="5305240">I don't think it makes any sense to permit New York to stop now and say we have courtrooms only so much -- judges only so much and we think we have enough judges for this and also one of the significant aspects of a jury trial system is a heavy incidence of waiver that it makes any sense to stop or permit New York to say we can now stop the 1969 with our facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.839" offset="5622680">Just briefly then, the equal protection issue we think is a bit more difficult because people I think about -- put their hand on one possible weakness in our case and that is, if we are right on the Sixth Amendment, we're begging the question in a way because we've got the constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.364" offset="5696867">We don't have to work out a classification problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.588" offset="5709720">Although I would suggest that if for some reason, I can't convince you, the Sixth Amendment takes us where we would like it that even without having the Sixth Amendment, where as I have said at the outset of my argument, the equal protection clause -- where the state does provide a right to jury trial, that right by its mere provision as this Court interpreted the state's practices in Duncan becomes a right of fundamental importance which then requires a rational and perhaps a compelling interest to deny a citizen within a state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.922" offset="5907101">The boundaries of the petty offense category as Mr. Justice White said in Duncan against Louisiana are ill-defined if not ambulatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.168" offset="5944090">This case presents the opportunity to define those boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.605" offset="5961749">A subsidiary question raised by appellant's claims relates to the alleged denial of equal protection of the laws in the geographical classification adopted by the New York legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.636" offset="6013889">I propose to rest entirely or almost entirely on our brief as to that issue, although I might perhaps say something about it in closing tomorrow morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.496" offset="6069373">The difficult question which the Court left open in Duncan as to the boundaries of the petty offense category does not have to be resolved without guidelines for indeed there have been substantial guidelines set down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.971" offset="6143248">The Court has made clear that imprisonment of itself does not render an offense serious such as to require trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.922" offset="6195075">It has also been stated unequivocally that an offense punishable by no more than six months imprisonment is a petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.344" offset="6236766">On the other hand, a crime punishable by two years is a serious offense, that was the holding in Duncan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.216" offset="6268217">So we have essentially in this case a choice between the six-month cutoff proposed by appellant and the one-year cutoff which we urge upon the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.356" offset="6324746">There is a temptation in choosing between these alternatives to what are priority judgment to say while this is serious or it isn't, I know it when I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.393" offset="6372916">But there are extensive indications, there are extensive circumstantial evidence in the experience of the states in the federal system of justice which point predominantly to the one-year cutoff as the proper boundary, as an objective boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.741" offset="6446373">Appellant claims that New York city in provisions for jury trials stands alone in the entire nation in withholding trial by a jury from offenses punishable by up to one-year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.124" offset="6507917">But it is not that clear as Mr. Justice Harlan implied in his question to Mr. Hellerstein, there are juries and and there are juries and since the issue before this Court is a constitutional issue under the Sixth Amendment, we would best look to the constitutional law as to what is a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.495" offset="6593390">That is a jury which consists of twelve persons rendering a unanimous verdict at a trial in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.191" offset="6628185">This common law, Sixth Amendment jury is withheld in 13 states for trials of crimes punishable by up to one-year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.949" offset="10307166">If that alternative is adopted I suppose there would be some limits on the state, for example the State of Louisiana chose a two-year cutoff and that was deemed to be impermissible under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.744" offset="10350320">But the state we urge can chose a cutoff which is not far out of line with the prevailing standards of seriousness and the one-year cutoff is the prevailing standard, the six-month cutoff is out of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.612" offset="10409775">The other alternative is to say that in every criminal case as two members of the court have said, where there is any imprisonment prescribed whatever the defendant is entitled to a trial by a jury because as to him, that is a serious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.755" offset="10474350">But the Court has reject -- the majority of the Court has consistently rejected that approach and so we urge that guided by these objective criterion, the Court, he simplest and most substantially based decision would be to accept the one-year -- accept the state provision providing for a one-year cutoff.</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="2621.514" offset="10589393">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.760" offset="10598379">I only have three matters I think of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.416" offset="10617083">Mr. Juviler has tried to tell you that Congress has placed a different emphasis on what a serious -- I'm not quite so sure that -- it was Justice Black that suggested it's relevant but even if it were relevant, it's not quite that accurate for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.698" offset="10706213">In Duncan, this Court pointed to Title 18, Section 1, six-month cutoff and said in a way indicia of Duncan by it be whether the case were triable in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.436" offset="10765145">That Title 1 still remains, still stands very similar to the New York penal law, the New York's structure of the penal law both prior to the revision now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.743" offset="10802343">The Federal Magistrates Act which Mr. Juviler speaks off, the rights of it has not changed anything at all with respect to the availability of a right to jury trial, putting aside constitutional considerations, the validity of the Magistrates Act because it may erase problems of non-Article 3 courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.310" offset="10884577">But the fact is that even under the Federal Magistrates Act which has the new classification, you are still entitled to a jury trial for anything over six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.653" offset="10921984">Mr. Chief Justice asked the question about the three-judge court and the demand how frequently and I don't know if its proper for me to comment on this since there is nothing in the record but if -- as member of the bar in this attorney joint legal society, I feel at least obligated to tell the Court that in the hall below, the criminal court system, there is a pressure upon defendants not to seek a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.167" offset="11047999">This is one of the things that doesn't -- to turn to plea bargain, namely what the defendant give up with respect to a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.272" offset="11080495">A three-judge court is not a highly local thing among the people who must work with the court. And lastly, I would only point out that in Frank, Mr. Justice Marshall wrote for the Court the maximum term of imprisonment even though there was a three year provision, it was only six months whereas in New York, if it were a class of misdemeanor, you can get a year imprisonment and three years probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.799" offset="11178611">Last thing, I have set forth in Appendix B a break down of the criminal code of the penal law of New York and I think Your Honors will see if you were even curious to looking to the nature of the offense rather than the term of punishment imposed that New York class a misdemeanor does not strike a court in terms of the petty offenses that one might find in history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.659" offset="11265964">You will find the concept of petty offenses historically is quite a stranger to the class of misdemeanor in New York.</text>
