            <text syncTime="32.549" offset="236690">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.265" offset="263544">The Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.756" offset="273471">This case involves the validity of a Maryland regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.960" offset="298235">Regulation of the State Board of Social Services which has been in a fact in varying forms since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.885" offset="337941">Which limits the total benefits payable to single family under the program to a families with dependent children $250.00 per month subject to certain exceptions none of which are here pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.656" offset="437102">This regulation has either been in a fact or been under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.454" offset="472210">Since the inception of state wide need standards under the AFDC program in Maryland in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.267" offset="527485">Their appears at page 116 of the record extract, a document generated of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.234" offset="571371">It was first considered imposing state wide “need standards” and the last paragraph of that document indicates that the State Board will be considering the question of whether the regulation should permit the setting of a maximum amount above which no grant will go, that appears at page 119 of the record aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.760" offset="677533">Subsequently in 1947, the first of this long serious maximum grant regulations was promulgate.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.914" offset="718075">There are extensive materials in the record here which relate to the considerations of which entered into the promulgation of this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.016" offset="778470">The materials in question minutes of State Board meetings and such appear at pages 127 through 147 of the record abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.168" offset="843149">I will not undertake a detailed summary of these materials here.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.807" offset="873660">Their also appears at page 165 of the record abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.985" offset="894349">The report of an unofficial committee of the body known as the Maryland Commission on Governmentally Efficiency in Economy in 1948 which shares the good deal of light on the thinking which entered into the promulgation of these maximum grant regulations beginning in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.110" offset="994868">Basically the thought behind the regulation, i think it's summed up in an affidavit of one of the veteran officials of the State Department of Social Services, an affidavit which appears at page 194 of the record abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.169" offset="1083162">And that affidavit states, it is my recollection that a maximum grant regulation has been in a fact in Maryland since approximately the time of inception of state wide “need standards” in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.940" offset="1150245">It is also my recollection that these maximum grant regulations consist simply have received federal approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.581" offset="1180756">I also recall, that one factor giving rise to these regulations was the strong feeling on the part of many county boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.265" offset="1215551">Particularly during the period following adoption of state wide “need standards” in 1944 that public assistants' payment shall not -- should not exceed the earnings of the head of a family when all for assistance and that the income of a public assistant recipient should not exceed that of his employed neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.369" offset="1303949">I recall that at various times during the early years following the introduction of the maximum grant regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.490" offset="1332370">The State Department of Public Welfare secured information as to way two levels from the state employment service that the information now secured with utilized in establishing maximum grant levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.622" offset="1384929">Now, the Maryland regulation is innate, it finds -- there are similar regulations in some 20 out of a States.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="332.516" offset="1436547">Through these two access, one on page of 119 and the other on page 194 indicate there are two quite disparate foundations for this maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.440" offset="1488165">One being the matter of the sufficiency of funds available, that's on 119; And the other quite a different one and that is a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.332" offset="1531737">So, it's not to have people on welfare have a hiring from the people who were against the employer of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.423" offset="1556187">Is that, do I understand that correctly?</text>

            <text syncTime="364.882" offset="1566009">I think Your Honor, that's correct in one sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.983" offset="1578339">I think Your Honor that there was -- there is problem in -- there was a problem of insufficient funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.178" offset="1607178">I'd rather put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.211" offset="1611254">There was a problem of insufficient funds and the board was confronted with the problem of making a choice between different means of carrying out of reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.507" offset="1648452">And for the policy reason that it thought that grant shouldn't exceed the income of employed families.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.929" offset="1678127">It choose the device of the maximum grant rather than the device of a presented reduction across the board for all AFDC recipients which is a devised, it's been employed in some other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.654" offset="1781049">Yes, they're always insufficient funds in almost any welfare program.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="430.652" offset="1829010">How do that suggest aspect to the reason this do fit family where there's no breadwinner?</text>

            <label>Mr. George W. Liebmann</label>
            <text syncTime="441.080" offset="1870806">Your Honor, we discussed this at some length in our brief and we suggest that in addition to the -- we suggest that there are several considerations which can support the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.302" offset="1963698">One of them is the element of work incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.214" offset="1979267">Another, is the undesirability of establishing benefit levels at levels higher than prevailing wage rates in the community because of the effect of this may have on families that are not on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.933" offset="2046140">Because of the possible incentive to family breakup which can be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.118" offset="2078950">And that I think is a major consideration behind the present discussion of welfare reform which would provide subventions to employed persons as well as unemployed persons that's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.606" offset="2132867">Not only with the effect of the regulations on people on welfare but appealing with this can't be divorce with consideration, problem consideration, of the effect of the regulations on people who are not on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.453" offset="2200263">There is another answer, I think to your question and that is that in speaking of families that don't have a breadwinner.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.436" offset="2264210">You are speaking of -- there are some families from which the male head is absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.127" offset="2298901">There are other families which male head is present but a disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.244" offset="2315410">There're other families and which male head is present but unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.513" offset="2340488">With respect to the disable and unemployed categories, I think the Court is aware of the provisions of the state unemployment compensation and workman's compensation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.876" offset="2409974">Which almost invariantly fixed benefits for the unemployed and for persons on workman's compensation at levels that are fraction of actual earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.782" offset="2453546">In Maryland, I believe the fraction is too big and this is done even though there are elaborate procedures for insuring that people are not malingering on the workman's compensation rules or malingering on the unemployment roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.779" offset="2509552">And the reason is I think, essentially a concession to administrative imperfection.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.617" offset="2536929">A feeling that if you don't set the benefit levels at least somewhat below the wage level, there is going to be abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.163" offset="2571097">And I think that that feeling also enters into the maximum grant regulation even in its application to families which when you look at the main now appear to have a wage enter and that the breadwinner maybe disabled or maybe unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.485" offset="2684364">I think if its rational really under the workman's compensation and unemployment insurance rules regulations for that reason it's rational here.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.237" offset="2723443">I should point out also that the Maryland regulation has two elements which are not present in the welfare regulation or some of the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.556" offset="2768687">One of them is that it's one of the highest such regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.166" offset="2783107">You are dealing here with the regulation that really is at least somewhat related to the minimum wage rate or the average wage rate efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.089" offset="2822813">When the none taxability of the benefits, when the various forms of the aid and kind are available -- that are available are considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.607" offset="2860847">You're talking about the level of income that is in fact considerable higher than your minimum wage or even your average wage in some forms of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.241" offset="2911420">That the second element and I think its worth expressing is that the Maryland regulation unlike those in some states such as Maine and Arizona is a limitation only on the amount of the grant and not on the amount of a welfare family's budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.138" offset="2982996">That is to say, if a family has state computed needs of $350.00 and the maximum of $250.00 in grant is applied to if the first $100.00 in earnings by a member of that family maybe retained without reducing the welfare grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.600" offset="3072857">For this reason, the Maryland regulation has some other important work incentive the facts which are not present in the regulations of those states such as Maine and Arizona that have a maximum budget limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.943" offset="3138267">Now, the complaint in this action made three claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.376" offset="3159897">The first was a claim of violation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.515" offset="3180481">That claim is contained in paragraph VII-C of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.398" offset="3208067">The second was a claim of violation of the Preamble of the Social Security Act of 1935, which was sent to afford the basis for finding that this regulation was inconsistent with the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.821" offset="3289778">There was no mention made in the complaint of any more specific violation of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.388" offset="3316005">The lower court in its initial opinion found a violation of Section 602(a)(9) of the Social Security Act and it conceded on re-argument that and I think I am quoting from a transcripts on re-argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.714" offset="3393327">The statutory argument is the basis of decision that was relatively speaking devised by the Court rather than the one that was impressed on the Court you and your colleagues addressing plaintiffs counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.051" offset="3450692">That I think is true and on re-argument, the conclusion that the statute violated that provision the Social Security Act was withdrawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.393" offset="3515998">The third contention was the violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.563" offset="3532716">I would like to deal with each of these three claims in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.756" offset="3553510">With respect to the claim of the violation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.189" offset="3571169">The state filed a motion to dismiss on ground of equitable extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.722" offset="3597291">The court below declines to abstain and its oral opinion on this point is found at page 83 of the record abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.201" offset="3643267">And it cited the case of King versus Smith for the proposition that it was proper for a federal court to go forward with an adjudication on the merits irrespective of whether a state court by state construction of state law at some later date might achieve the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.298" offset="3719649">That language doesn't appear anywhere in King versus Smith because I think it's clear that King v. Smith was concerned with the fact that there is no federal requirement of exhaustion of state administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.261" offset="3783492">King versus Smith was concerned with the exhaustion problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.124" offset="3798956">The question of equitable abstention in favor of state judicial remedies was not an issue in King versus Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.972" offset="3838349">Now, it's the state's position here that the claim, that the regulation was violated of state law should've been regarded as providing a basis for equitable abstention in the favor of a declaratory judgment action in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.903" offset="3930091">And that is I think clear from the cases under the Maryland Declaratory Judgment Act, that where the general validity of state's statute or regulation is a sale as it is here, that an action in a state courts for declaratory judgment would lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.754" offset="4001458">State Courts of course could've determine all three questions raised by the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.761" offset="4021520">The federal court was effectively limited to the two federal questions and the reasons that you have this collision between the federal court and the state regulation was the failure to abstain in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3129.083" offset="12622806">And I think, when the State talks about their rational purposes to say their regulation from falling under the Equal Protection case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.488" offset="12664393">I think they used the same approach that the state did used in the Shapiro v. Thompson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.293" offset="12695636">The same blond the bus approached that they talk for example that, the regulations in somehow incurred is employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.392" offset="12735969">But when we look at the facts in those case and we look at the less eligibility principle that was enunciated in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.180" offset="12763136">I think in 1825, we know that we moved along way from then and this Court in Smith v. King -- King v. Smith did recognized that we have a much more sophisticated and in line of Welfare program now which looks toward rehabilitation and reeducation and retraining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.132" offset="12838996">And as a matter of fact, this 1967 Amendments to the Social Security Act, clearly provide for this kind of an approach to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.329" offset="12875776">It sets up a very complicated scheme of a when program that requires welfare recipients to not only seek retaining but to seek employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.372" offset="12919975">And in this particular light, the -- in light of the employment purpose pointed out by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.014" offset="12958532">The regulation under the traditional test of Equal Protection and we have first argued in our brief in traditional test of Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.427" offset="12996148">This purpose is closely over inclusive for it would clearly involve people who has out name plaintiffs are not able to work both of our name plaintiffs in this case are disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.214" offset="13063335">In addition to that, it's applied only against large families as if to assume that the heads of all large families are employable but that small families and the heads of small families somehow do not need this type of encouragement to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.286" offset="13115580">So, it is grossly over inclusive, it is under inclusive in the sense that it does not include this more family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.698" offset="13145255">So, it suffers from this uniqueness of being not only over inclusive and but under inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.830" offset="13169810">The exhibits of the State and the State has referred to some of their exhibits point out for example that only a 167 -- 166 families on the whole welfare program were assisted with employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.291" offset="13227593">Now, we have at least 2500 families who were affected by the maximum grant regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.368" offset="13255910">In addition to that, the exhibits that have been put into this appendix by the state also indicate that even if all of the jobs in Maryland were somehow to be employed for welfare recipients still wouldn't be enough jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.773" offset="13321529">So that this particular purpose really has no viability in light of the amendments to the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.306" offset="13351623">In addition to that, the State talks about this regulation somehow acting as a family stabilizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.954" offset="13382238">I think this purpose of ironic in a view of the stipulations which show how a family is encourage to disintegrate and instead of to stay together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.084" offset="13422780">Again, it is over inclusive and exhibit which the state itself put into evidence in the court below and this is contained on page 154 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.527" offset="13472517">Points out that only 15% of families on welfare are on welfare because the head of the family dissert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.120" offset="13510969">For the purpose of encouraging heads of large families only no to dissert, we are going to punish 85% of the welfare case modes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.914" offset="13550049">This is grossly over inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.425" offset="13560184">In addition, again, it has that uniqueness of being under inclusive for it is only applied against the heads of large families.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.168" offset="13595084">Firmly, the state would talk about it being deceptive to child bearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.415" offset="13616086">Well, this Court has spoken about the right to appropriation and marital privacy in Skinner and Griswold and Justice Douglas as I know was quite for me would this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.095" offset="13658823">And so, they would seek to invade this highly protected right of marital privacy and of right to procreation for the purpose of this particular regulation which again would affect only the heads of large families.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.174" offset="13731129">So that we are talking about a purpose which would begin to invade a fundamental right, the right of appropriation and the right to marital privacy.</text>
