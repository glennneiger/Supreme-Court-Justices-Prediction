            <text syncTime="18.622" offset="177821">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.980" offset="191300">I appear for the appellants and my argument time is being shared by counsel for the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission because the Government has aligned itself in this case on appellant's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.570" offset="245635">These are two direct appeals from two cases heard together by a three-judge District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.704" offset="274160">The two cases were suits to review the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in allowing to be discontinued a portion of one passenger train and all of another passenger trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.454" offset="321181">The partial discontinuance involved the Chicago to Evansville, Indiana segment of the Georgian train which operates from Chicago to Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.140" offset="355976">A complete discontinuance was the Hummingbird train which operates from Cincinnati to New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.824" offset="378650">The interconnection is that national.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.705" offset="390144">The appellants have a substantial interest in the service and these are the only trains, the only daily trains from Chicago to Terre, Vincennes, Evansville, Chattanooga, Atlanta, Mobile, and are the only daily service from Chicago to Nashville and Montgomery, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.749" offset="458376">The court below dismissed both of the actions for lack of jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.243" offset="476348">The Court said that Congress intended to deny judicial review to the public because when the carrier prevails at the ICC, the order is one discontinue the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.814" offset="522637">On the other hand if the railroad loses that the ICC, the order is one requiring the continued train operations and the railroad can go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.202" offset="564224">And we think this is unfair and the reason we think it's legally unfair is that Congress never intended the unfair result.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.382" offset="608946">And there's nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the public can't go to court but the railroads can go to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.155" offset="671953">I just thought I mentioned the word unfairness since it's come up today.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.630" offset="685850">Two of the lower court decisions which we rely on did use the word unfair and said that Congress could not be presumed to have intended such an unfair result.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="156.537" offset="729527">Well, that's quite a different argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_p_macdougall" startTime="158.477" stopTime="311.861">
            <label>Mr. Gordon P. Macdougall</label>
            <text syncTime="158.477" offset="737259">The appellants here today are seven regulatory commissions, one state, nine communities, three labor organizations, and one railroad passenger association.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.257" offset="772368">We are supported an amicus brief by the national association of regulatory commissioners until the commissioners representing all of the state commissions for the 50 states, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.165" offset="820015">And the appellees are the Chicago and East Illinois Railroad and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.274" offset="840495">The sole issue before the Court in our judgment is whether Congress did intend to deny judicial review to the public while granting such judicial review to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.760" offset="878425">There's no question of standing involved, eight district courts have expressly passed upon the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.447" offset="905174">Two early decisions in 1965, held it was no judicial review for the public and all of the decisions since then have held to the opposite that there is judicial review and one of these other decisions was granted by a three-judge court for the same Northern District of Illinois after the judges below were entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.147" offset="992005">Now the statute we have here is Section 13 (a) (1), of the Interstate Commerce Act which became a law in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.394" offset="1028995">And contrary to the opinion below, there is nothing in the language or the legislative history of 13 (a) (1) to suggest that Congress intended to deny judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.254" offset="1068387">The general framework of the Interstate Commerce Act is that decisions of the Commission are subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.543" offset="1097540">There's nothing unusual about an order discontinuing and investigation at the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.800" offset="1114572">This is what to do and virtually all of the rate cases and those decisions have been subject to review and reviewed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.959" offset="1147173">Ever since the Rochester decision in 1939 and Administrative Procedure Act in 1946, the Commission institutes an investigation of a freight rate, the fines unlawful, the order is one discontinued investigation, exactly the one which appellants were denied judicial review for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.220" offset="1228257">Now the lower court based its -- primarily based its opinion on the wording of the statute and they said that where the Railroad files a notice, and elects to supersede state jurisdiction, the ICC has authority in that 30-day notice period to either institute investigation or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.914" offset="1319058">It doesn't institute an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.753" offset="1326373">The lower court felt that the train off becomes effective pursuant to the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="496.637" offset="2089880">Right and I point out that Section 1336 (a) of Title 28 says that you can go to court for any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the question is whether in order to discontinue an investigation is such an order now.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.476" offset="2145259">Whether Commission doesn't investigate a case, there's no order.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.854" offset="2154768">There's a notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.928" offset="2159052">There is no such thing as an order issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.421" offset="2177024">And that really is our case in a nutshell.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.626" offset="2201893">The second reason given by the court below was that if you allowed judicial review, you'll have delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.815" offset="2222582">And there's a congressional purpose to stop the delays that were occurring at the state commission level.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.074" offset="2251630">And Congress set up a dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.480" offset="2261243">Most train of todays are as decided not to cite it before the state commissions not the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.624" offset="2289873">Section 13 (a) (1) is not self-executing statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.754" offset="2302412">Not self-implementing a carrier has to file a notice and that acts supersedes a state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.233" offset="2336266">Therefore, we have a situation where this statute has been set up and Congress answered the delay problem by imposing a four-month limitation upon the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.370" offset="2396871">That's where they answer the delay you have judicial review of state commissions and there's no reason why you can't have judicial review of ICC decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.183" offset="2436054">The Louisville and Nashville on brief suggest that if you have judicial review, you're going to have injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.595" offset="2465729">Our answer to that is that that's alright but that issue is not before this Court because the Louisville and Nashville stop the train at Birmingham and an application for stay was denied so the questions of injunctions are stays pendente lite are not before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.864" offset="2530826">Now the sole issue is whether there is ultimate judicial review and as an important case to Chicago and the Southern States involved and to all the regulatory commissions and we ask that the judgments below be reversed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="1115.119" offset="4563884">It boils down in a sense to a fairness question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.897" offset="4578931">I'd say only that on the law what you got here is a declaratory order in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.192" offset="4620100">Of the kind that was used in the Frozen Food Express case, and there, the Court held that an order would simply have the effect of declaring what certain rights -- a Commission order declaring certain rights under the agricultural exemption to the law was said to be reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.814" offset="4698676">Now that order I might say in the Frozen Food Express case contained the same language that we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.342" offset="4724694">It made -- the order made certain findings of -- the Commission made certain findings, it incorporated those findings and its order by reference and it said the investigation is discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.716" offset="4762206">There's nothing magic in that formula, well, that's just something the Commission says all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.850" offset="4778820">It says it in rate proceedings as Mr. MacDougall pointed it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.303" offset="4800554">What we've got here it seems to the Government is just a disregard of this Court's decision in Rochester Telephone Corporation against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.210" offset="4836185">Here we have people who go into the Commission and protest the discontinuance of a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.286" offset="4860531">They are asking the Commission to order something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.887" offset="4870875">Order the continuance of that train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.178" offset="4880071">They are denied that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.657" offset="4889997">When they are denied in order, they have a reviewable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.235" offset="4904312">And in Rochester Telephone, this Court said, "In order of the Commission dismissing a complaint on the merits and maintaining the status quo, is an exercise of administrative function no more and no less than an order directing some change in status."</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.879" offset="4958856">And the Court held that kind of an order to be reviewable in Rochester and that's all we got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.602" offset="4977768">Now the lower courts have relied particularly on United States against Los Angeles Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.451" offset="5005145">The granddaddy of this line of cases that says that these things aren't reviewable, is it State of Minnesota against United States to Minnesota Court decision which pick up the Los Angeles case, Los Angeles case involved a valuation order, and Justice Brandeis for this Court said that this order which simply declares what the value of the Railroads property is not a reviewable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.450" offset="5109217">Because nothing happens as a result but nobody's ordered to do anything and nobody is affected by it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.065" offset="5139623">Well, this Court held only in that case that the valuation order since it didn't affect anything was not right for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.953" offset="5163133">The impact of that valuation order would be felt when and if the Commission did something on the basis of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.940" offset="5183091">So the Los Angeles case is only a ripeness case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.609" offset="5193853">And certainly not a basis for denying review in this kind of situation where I don't think there's any doubt that there's a direct impact which makes the case right for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.921" offset="5239097">Now we've mentioned briefly the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.814" offset="5250591">The desire to expedite the discontinuance of trains to avoid the delays that occurred in the state proceedings, now the desire for speed, the desire for expedition is not inconsistent with judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.835" offset="5306702">And judicial review doesn't mean that in every case, a train whose discontinuance is permitted by the Commission will be kept in operation by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.627" offset="5341915">Out of some 147 discontinuances, after investigation since the Commission or since the statute was adopted, I think there have been only six or I think it's nine, now there have been three more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.256" offset="5400430">There had only been nine cases in which temporary relief has been granted pending judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.150" offset="5428015">And of course, whether temporary relief is going to be granted at all in any of these cases and that's really what the Railroads are afraid of, is a matter of the kind of showing made by the plaintiff's in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.104" offset="5483813">You don't get preliminary injunctions as a matter of course from three-judge courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.409" offset="5501053">The Urgent Deficiencies Act contemplates that the courts are going to act with expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.796" offset="5518608">And the real issue is expedition in the review process not denying review altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.238" offset="5540342">Now the only other two grounds that I relied on to deny review are first that there are some difference in the substantive standard between 13 (a) (1) which is the -- which governs interstate trains and 13 (a) (2) which governs intrastate trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.551" offset="5605543">The Railroad seemed to concede that under 13 (a) (2) there is judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.569" offset="5621635">But the answer to that is that this Court has said in Southern Railway Company against North Carolina that the substantive standards are the same and in fact if you look at them although there are some slight word in differences it amounts to the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.485" offset="5669282">Public convenience and well does the public convenience and necessity hereof require the continuance of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.240" offset="5692374">Will it unduly burden interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.649" offset="5701987">I've mentioned we've discussed, I think at some length the other reason this a fortiori argument that if you open an investigation or if you don't open an investigation, it has the same effect as if you did open an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.891" offset="5754964">They are different because the standards for review are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.765" offset="5770428">I think the best analogy one can give is the situation in which the general counsel at the NLRB issues a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.656" offset="5794043">Now, his decision to issue a complaint or not issue a complaint is a matter of his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.494" offset="5817344">It's not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.542" offset="5821524">But if he issues a complaint and the NLRB acts on that complaint, that is judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.380" offset="5844929">For these reasons and the unfairness, of the standard the railroads are arguing which says that commuters and communities are not entitled to judicial review but railroads are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.016" offset="5895398">We think the decision of the court below is wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.991" offset="5975333">Section 13 (a) (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act is unique among the various provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.115" offset="6003858">And that the authority to discontinue interstate passenger trains comes directly from the statute and not from any action of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.860" offset="6042833">It was passed by Congress to meet a pressing problem to enable Railroads to promptly and effectively remove unneeded and not used passenger trains from their system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.557" offset="6089644">And we submit respectfully that the concept of judicial review will frustrate the very intent that under which Congress enact Section 13 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.613" offset="6133844">Section 13 (a) (1) is self-implementing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.894" offset="6146905">And it grants to the carrier upon posting of a 30-day notice the right to discontinue the train that in the Interstate Commerce Commission need do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.208" offset="6184208">The statute applies in 30 days of trains go off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.335" offset="6200717">Now if the Commission orders an investigation, they must notify the carriers at least 10 days before the train is to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.255" offset="6228407">They don't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.030" offset="6231542">The train goes off at the end of 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.120" offset="6243871">Then the effect of the 30-day or the investigation is to postpone for an additional four-month period the time within which the railroads are authorize by statute to discontinue the trains.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.520" offset="6357452">It is indeed Your Honor because the Interstate Commerce Commission can prevent the discontinuance of an interstate train only on the finding by the Commission that a public need exist for the train and that it is not an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce for the train to be continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.885" offset="6442924">Now this is the only order that can be issued in an investigation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.202" offset="6464136">Their discontinuance although they label it in order, the Commission labels it in order is not in fact an order because the Railroads are simply taking advantage of what the statute grants them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.159" offset="6508022">The right to discontinue the notice or order as the Commission calls it is simply a means of notifying the people who participated in the proceeding as to what the Commission has done with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.150" offset="6567999">If they can't make the specific statutory findings and both of them, then there is no basis under which the railroad can be required to keep the trains on for a period of maximum period of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.185" offset="6624110">In that regard, there is a great difference between the provisions of Section 13 (a) (1) and Section 13 (a) (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.330" offset="6664652">A railroad which wants to take off an intrastate passenger train must first proceed before the state regulatory body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.445" offset="6689102">If that state does nothing within a 120 days or acts unfavorably within that period they then have the right to petition of the Interstate Commerce Commission and seek authority from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.177" offset="6736123">This isn't a matter of authority coming from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.697" offset="6746154">This authority comes from the Commission and the Railroad has the burden of meeting both of the statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.736" offset="6774366">In order to discontinue an intrastate train by contrast, the parties other than the Commission must find rather that both public need requires continued operation of the interstate commerce -- of an interstate train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.125" offset="6843852">And two, that an undue burden would not be placed upon the railroads by that continued operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.787" offset="6874572">In other words, the Commission has to meet both statutory standards for an interstate train to be taken of whereas the corollary has to be proven by the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.477" offset="6921279">The carriers have nothing to prove in the 13 (a) (1) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.513" offset="6933400">They can take off an interstate train for any reason they choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.351" offset="6948760">So long as they publish the required notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.355" offset="6984808">I think it is abundantly clear to everyone that Section 13 (a) is an altogether different section of the Interstate Commerce Act than any other section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.867" offset="7030888">The District Court in the New Jersey case which this Court affirmed in County Bergen made the statement, Section 13 (a) (1) embodies a new and distinct exercise of the congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.652" offset="7081984">Its language is clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.700" offset="7094209">And therefore neither admits or nor requires any construction by comparison with any other section or subsection of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.328" offset="7140707">The statute itself is self-implementing the other provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.629" offset="7169860">For example, if a railroad seeks to abandon a line of railroad, it must do so by applying to the Commission and seeking the Commission's authority and the only basis under which that authority can be granted is by the Commission issuing a certificate at present or future public convenience and necessity permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.146" offset="7243943">It's the Commission's decision, the Commission's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.743" offset="7258363">It is totally different than what you have involved in Section 13 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.188" offset="7308100">I might say that that Commission itself has consistently recognized that it is not given the authority to approve or disapprove an interstate train can discontinuance under Section 13 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.209" offset="7364211">In the Great Northern Case at 307 ICC 59, page 76, they specifically held that we have no discretion to approve or disapprove a proposed discontinuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.531" offset="7409455">Our duty is in appropriate cases to investigate the facts and only if such investigation warrants the findings specified in the statute may we require a railroad to continue or restore the service which is the subject of the investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.995" offset="7535365">They are there called upon to approve or disapprove the proposal of the Railroad to discontinue the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.513" offset="7561383">The statute does not give -- 13 (a) (1) does not give to the Commission the power to disapprove or approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.348" offset="7600776">The statute gives the Commission only one-fifth of limited veto power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.969" offset="7619271">Limited jurisdiction to require the Railroad to continue to operate the trains for an additional year if the Commission finds after investigation: one, that there is a public need for the trains and two, that continued operation would not constitute an undue burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.821" offset="7694608">Unless the Commission can make both of those findings, the Railroad discontinues a train by operation statute and not by any Commission order of lack of order and this is why you get into the question of fairness or lack of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.049" offset="7743613">You do not have -- you only have an order issued by the Commission in those instances and when the Commission orders a railroad to continue the operation for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.963" offset="7791261">As this Court has held in the Atlantic Coast Line case, ICC versus Atlantic Coast Line that a Commission order is reviewable if it determines rights or obligations from which legal consequences may flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.875" offset="7858866">I respectfully submit that there are no legal rights in the interest of the appellants in this case to which they are entitled to judicially review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.542" offset="7897527">And I think that this Court has answered that question in the New Jersey case because if the appellants have a right in a 13 -- Section 13 (a) proceeding, that right should certainly survive the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission whether it would or would not investigate a train off case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.933" offset="7983104">In those instances where the Commission refuses to investigate, the interest of communities in the State of New Jersey, its public service commission and the County of Bergen and all others certainly was as great as it is when the Commission sets a case down for hearing that this Court has held that there is no judicial review where the Commission does not investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.784" offset="8066487">Now, it certainly there's nothing in the manner in which Congress drafted Section 13 (a) (1) that suggest any fragmentizing of the question of judicial review depending on whether the ICC decides to investigate or whether it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.997" offset="8147362">And in a corollary to that point, I believe is the fact that the argument of the Government in this case is that the ICC decides whether judicial review is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.375" offset="8200861">Now certainly Congress never intended that when they enacted Section 13 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.745" offset="8218311">But the Government says if the Commission does not investigate, then it is not subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.228" offset="8248299">However, if the Commission does investigate, it is subject to the judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.756" offset="8266376">Now, the question of whether an investigation is held or not, is dependent according to government solely on the question of whether a substantial question exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.233" offset="8304306">And so by the simple expedient of the Commission deciding whether or not a substantial question exists, judicial review is or is not had but it is not certainly in the statute that nor an intention of Congress when it enacted Section 13 (a) (1) that any such distinction could ever be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.194" offset="8392182">I might say Your Honors, that in other point which bears very directly on this issue and that on the question of judicial review are the circumstances underlying the enactment of Section 13 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.911" offset="8447039">In 1958, the Railroads were in dire financial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.719" offset="8462294">They were losing at the rate of about $700 million a year on their passenger train operations alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.726" offset="8490297">Theretofore, the railroads were relegated to the piecemeal approach of going to each of the various states to which the interstate train operates and to seek their authority to discontinue train frequently that authority was denied or in many cases unduly delayed and as a consequence, Congress was highly concerned with the extensive delays that were being experience and the costly of delays and burdens on the railroads to operate unneeded and costly passenger trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.891" offset="8610983">This was the very purpose that Congress entered the field and when it did it gave the carriers the right to completely bypass any state regulatory proceeding by the expedient of filing a notice which in 30 days would enable them to discontinue the train unless postpone for another four months by the institution of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.221" offset="8708263">The Government and appellants would have this Court believe that the concept of judicial review is not incompatible with the intent of Congress to dispose of these cases as promptly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.468" offset="8769285">Congress has set a maximum period of five months under which a train has to be operated unless the Commission issues an order base on the two statutory standards previously mentioned requiring continued operation for one more year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.219" offset="8836263">But the point I think is establish by the circumstances in number 102, the L &amp; N trains that are involved in the so-called Hummingbird trains between Cincinnati and New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.609" offset="8881821">The day before the discontinuance was to take effect, the appellants, filed suit in the federal court in Chicago and obtained the temporary restraining order which restraining order remained in effect for a period of nine months after the date that the L &amp; N filed its notice to discontinue the trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.920" offset="8967084">Congress set the period at five months as a maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.211" offset="8992266">And yet, here the L &amp; N was operating a train that was losing money at the rate of a million dollars a year for an additional period time without any protection of the bond and I there say that if this Court had granted a stay at the District Court's order then we would still be operating it.We would be losing at the rate of a million and a half dollars would have lost it, at least a million and a half dollars by now and the continuing to operate until further order of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.790" offset="9098533">I would certainly don't think that there's any consistency between the intention of Congress in enacting and putting on a maximum five months statutory suspension period and the concept to judicial review where railroads are frequently faced with temporary restraining orders where bonds are not given for the adequate protection of any damages that might be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.404" offset="9192991">I might want to say one more thing if Your Honors please with respect to the Los Angeles case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.473" offset="9225279">As this Court held in that proceeding that there are so-called orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission which are not subject to judicial review, with respect to the discontinuance of a proceeding under Section 13 (a) (1) that Commission does characterized its discontinuance as an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.801" offset="9306572">There is nothing in the statute that says they should characterize it as an order and in fact it's nothing more that a notice to the parties and if anything a housekeeping order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.742" offset="9346382">It is not an order ordering anybody to do anything in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.826" offset="9370728">And under those circumstances, we respectfully submit that the decision of Los Angeles is in effect apposite to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.909" offset="9406986">And what is -- what the Commission has simply done in issuing its so-called order of noticing discontinuance, it is merely the statement of the results of its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.490" offset="9465292">Thank you Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.834" offset="9534673">I'd like to just mention one or two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.913" offset="9547003">The first is that where the Commission does enter upon an investigation during the 30 days notice period and where it does issue an order requiring continued operation of the trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.109" offset="9607816">After that point, the discontinuance of the trains does not come operative pursuant to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.538" offset="9633520">It becomes operative pursuant to the expiration of that Commission order, an order which the Commission determines it will not renew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.303" offset="9672600">So, if there is a Commission approval or disapproval of the train off case, once they enter upon an investigation, now it's true that in the 30-day notice period if they decide not to investigate, the discontinuance would take place pursuant to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.881" offset="9742921">Now that case is not before us today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.648" offset="9753997">We're not rearguing the State of New Jersey or finding out what modification of it should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.858" offset="9778761">The case we have here today is that the Commission did institute an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.045" offset="9795584">And moreover, they held hearings and the statute requires a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.086" offset="9811675">Section 13 (a) (1) (ph) requires a hearing requires evidence and requires findings under Section 14 (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.792" offset="9846575">Once the Commission enters an investigation, it has to make findings and a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.215" offset="9868204">And the last thing I'd like to say is that order simply discontinued an investigation is common at the Commission, common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.496" offset="9897357">It hasn't come to before this Court perhaps to such a precise distinguishing between what do they do on remand if they set aside the court that is in order of discontinuing investigation but this is -- does happen behind the scenes of all of the freight rate cases.</text>
