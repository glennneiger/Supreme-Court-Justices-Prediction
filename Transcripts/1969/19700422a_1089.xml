            <text syncTime="39.532" offset="261517">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.950" offset="275205">This is an appeal from the Illinois Supreme Court presenting the question whether Illinois statutes which authorize a pauper’s incarceration in excess of the maximum period prescribed by law, at the rate of $5.00 a day for payment of fine and Court costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.610" offset="341765">Despite the fact that the defendant is willing and able to pay them, if given the opportunity, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.197" offset="376142">The facts which are undisputed are briefly as follows: the complaint was issued in June of 1967 against Willie Williams for the crime of theft of property not from the person, and not exceeding $150.00 in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.012" offset="431417">A warrant was issued and a $2000.00 bail was set.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.607" offset="445837">Williams was arrested on August 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.316" offset="456600">The case was brought before the Court the following day on August 14 at which at the time bail was set at $2000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.351" offset="488782">Williams was remanded to jail on motion of the state, the case was continued to August 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.567" offset="509680">On August 16, the case was again continued on motion of the state to September 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.944" offset="531101">On September 6, the trial commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.424" offset="541027">The defendant appeared in the Court said, there was no Court reporter present.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.909" offset="555029">The record shows that the defendant waived his right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.200" offset="568195">The case was tried before the judge without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.301" offset="580524">Finding of guilty was made and the maximum of sentence of one year plus a $500.00 fine was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.181" offset="608110">The $5.00 cost was also made part of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.818" offset="622634">And the judgment further ordered that the defendant stand committed in jail, if he would default from the payment of the fine and cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.480" offset="661295">Sometime afterward the defendant contacted the civil legal aid service in the jail and a petition was presented to the sentencing judge, November of 1967, which prayed that the portion of the sentencing order of September 6, which directed that the defendants stand committed in default of payment of the fine and cost be vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.112" offset="751783">That further prayed that the defendant be granted sufficient time and wish to obtain the funds and wish to pay the fine and cost and further asked for such other relief as maybe just inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.728" offset="798281">The petition was made under oath and contained some of the following allegations, that defendant was indigent, inmate of the county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.378" offset="832867">He had no funds, no valuable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.642" offset="845928">He had been unable to post bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.503" offset="857422">He lacked $200.00, wished to post the 10% under the Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.581" offset="877693">He was unable to hire an attorney and that he was then unable to pay the fine and cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.150" offset="907995">He further recited that he had been in jail since August 13 and had been unable to earn funds since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.264" offset="936417">And it further alleged that if the defendant were released from jail upon the expiration of the one-year jail sentence that he would be able to get a job and earn the funds to pay the fine and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.475" offset="989288">The state did not contravene the factual allegation but moved to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.806" offset="1006634">The lower court dismissed the petition without evidentiary hearing and an appeal was taken to the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.270" offset="1036413">The Illinois Supreme Court held that there is no denial of Equal Protection of the law, when an indigent defendant is imprisoned to satisfy payment of his fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.972" offset="1075284">The Illinois Supreme Court granted a stayed pending appeal, and for the stayed the mandate pending appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.395" offset="1104959">It should be noted at the outset what is not challenged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.445" offset="1121155">We do not challenge the practice of incarcerating contumacious defendant who refuses to pay the fine nor do we attack the discretion of the sentencing judges who wish to make the punishment for the offender, nor do we attack defendant's obligation to pay that debt, nor do we attack --</text>

            <text syncTime="312.363" offset="1352808">We did not urge the right to counsel the question for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.858" offset="1370781">The first reason is that it was doubtful of whether or not the defendant would succeed in that because under Illinois law, the right to counsel depends upon a request for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.558" offset="1413622">Secondly, the possibility was substantial that if there had been a retrial, or would have been a reconviction with the same sentence, which would only have resulted in the issue coming up at a later stage, and possibly the defendant is spending more time in jail than he did with respect to this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="407.953" offset="1735137">Well, I think he received approximately 84 days, which is a normal good time credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.825" offset="1758647">So it would be a year plus five days minus 84, which would be the period from August of 1967 to May of 1968, about nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.230" offset="1816325">What we do challenge in this case is the construction of the statute by the Illinois Supreme Court which authorizes 24-hour a day imprisonment over the maximum at the rate of $5.00 a day, despite the fact that the defendant has said without any opposition by the state that he will go out and get a job, and earn the funds to pay his fine if he is given the opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.381" offset="1912874">The state has indicated that it has two primary goals to be served, the practice of incarceration of indigence should be sustained because of those goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.556" offset="1949550">Those are deterrence of crime and collection of revenue from the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.388" offset="1968880">But whatever the examination reveals that round-the-clock imprisonment of an indigent under these circumstances is neither necessary nor rationally related to the stated goals and that there are clearly less onerous alternatives and perhaps more effective ones to satisfy the state's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.616" offset="2041814">Certainly, if the state's interest is in collecting the revenue by remitting the person to jail, they're not going to get the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.905" offset="2075042">And in addition, the state has to pay substantial amount of money to house prisoners in already overcrowded and overburdened facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.919" offset="2107016">Could the state insist that we pay the fine by working for the state, and I don't say in a workhouse or in a work farm or something like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.412" offset="2161037">Well, it's our position that the state could certainly do that as long they let him go at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.919" offset="2187055">In a hierarchy of alternatives that we have suggested, we have placed remitting to the work house as one of the possibilities, but the problem is in this case, that they keep the man in jail around the clock and there's absolutely no justification for incarcerating somebody at night merely because they're extracting his day life, that's wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.654" offset="4830020">Or that no work is provided for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.912" offset="4842977">Now, there's always housekeeping available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.945" offset="4855202">In fact, the record shows, the jail record of Williams is included in here on page 33 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.319" offset="4884668">And it does show that when he was serving his jail time, he worked in the laundry and he worked in the tailor shop and he worked in something beginning with 'K' which I think is the kitchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.125" offset="4927822">So that, all people that are in jail have the opportunity to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.766" offset="4946422">So person who is serving off or working off a fine is not going to be doing anything differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.722" offset="4990307">The state has attempted to suggest that the policy of deterrence requires the result reached in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.060" offset="5039626">We dispute that contention for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.524" offset="5053419">First, the fact the Illinois is going under 180-6 to discharge a persons who are unable to work or for whom no work is provided is an indication that automatic incarceration of everybody who don't pay fines, not necessary to the enforcement of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.312" offset="5160626">We submit that the fine is certainly a different order of punishment than a jail sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.810" offset="5190614">If the trial judge wishes to individualize the sentence, imposed a fine because he feels that the interest of society require no more than a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.260" offset="5236381">It's inconsistent with that trial judge's determination then to have the defendant sitting in jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.968" offset="5479215">There is a due process aspect to this extent that the state seems to be conclusively presuming that incarceration is necessary because the person might run away and they lose the risk, so to speak, and he'll run away from the job and he won't be around to pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.501" offset="5561344">That type conclusive presumption in the absence any showing, any hearing, any inquiry, certainly doesn't comport with fundamental principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.106" offset="5595826">So, to that extent, there is this blend of Due Process into the Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.637" offset="5633964">The state's attempt to justify this 24-hour day incarceration for fear that some people might skip is not based upon any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.708" offset="5670222">Certainly, not in this record and I take it the state this arguing in a broad proposition that they're entitled to incarcerate somebody around the clock in any case regardless of the fact that a felon may come in and say, “Well, look, I have great possibility of getting a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.085" offset="5731662">I could earn enough funds in perhaps a week or two to pay off this fine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.963" offset="5751202">But -- and the state says, it wants the revenue from collecting these fines, and yet that state does precisely by incarcerating the person and depriving him the opportunity to go out to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.410" offset="6504991">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.368" offset="6524844">In 1927, Mr. Justice Holmes referred to the Equal Protection Clause as the last resort of constitutional arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.029" offset="6563506">Reading the opinions of this Court will show that we have come quite a ways since that characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.533" offset="6589524">In fact, Judge Skelly Wright of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia recently referred to the Equal Protection Clause as the cutting edge of our expanding constitutional liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.031" offset="6643545">One of the issues that's involved in this case before the Court today is whether that cutting edge will press so deeply not only into the statutory scheme in the state of Illinois, the statutory of scheme of the other American states in the Federal Government, to compel those states and the Federal Government to adopt the system of criminal justice administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.337" offset="6736750">Greatly different from that which they have adopted by the legislative process in the name of the explication of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.921" offset="6779068">I think we should consider at the outset what some of the interests are in considering the context or setting of the Equal Protection argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.950" offset="6823163">As Mr. Justice Brennan referred to it in the concurring opinion of Allen versus Illinois just some weeks ago, the constitutional claims must be considered in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.609" offset="6865795">And we think the context of the Equal Protection claim here is an important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.147" offset="6891917">First, the history of incarceration to work off a fine which cannot or will not be paid is an ancient one far outdating the American legal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.087" offset="6959731">Mr. Justice Black said in his opinion for the Court in Kotch versus the Board of River Pilots some years ago and in a dissenting opinion in Harper versus the Virginia Board of Elections, the history of a practice in important in considering whether or not that practice violates the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.332" offset="7048652">Similarly, the widespread usage of a particular feature of a criminal justice system by the states and by the Federal Government is also important in assessing its validity under the Federal Constitution as was noted for the Court in the opinion in Roth versus the United States for the fact that not only in all American jurisdictions and the Federal Government ban the dissemination of obscenity but most of the civilized nations of the world did as well, we think it's equally relevant then to consider in the context of whether or not Equal Protection has been violated here, that all of the states of the Federal Union for years and years and years and the English Government before that have allowed the incarceration of those who cannot or will not pay their fines until the fines has worked off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.676" offset="7258049">The impact of this Court's holding that the Illinois system is unconstitutional must also be considered, we believe, for this Court to decide how far they will take the Equal Protection Clause because if the challenge to Illinois statute is successful in this Court today, similar challenges will follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.658" offset="7350000">Challenge to the bail system, the claim that the requirement of a monetary bail in any case is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.992" offset="7375391">If other factors will show or seek to persuade that the defendant will not flee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.228" offset="9704260">But the sentence in this case was a year in jail and a fine of $500.00, a sentence permissible under Illinois law, sentence which is not challenged in this Court on grounds of constitutionality or rationality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.489" offset="14421347">I don't think so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.582" offset="14425736">I think that the traffic courts have utilized the fines as a method of keeping the system supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.722" offset="14450291">I don't think there's any reason to believe that the traffic courts are going to change their practices overnight.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.921" offset="14475055">Well, I wasn't thinking so much of traffic court as the misdemeanor court dealing with behavior not as serious as the behavior involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.174" offset="14516120">I think we're entitled to trust the trial judges' discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.161" offset="14528031">If they want to individualize the sentence, they should be allowed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.156" offset="14544018">If they think that a fine is called for rather than imprisonment, they will impose a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.912" offset="14563035">If they feel that incarceration is called for, they will impose incarceration.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3620.020" offset="14583411">The matter of your view then I take it is that there is no potential for the -- what I've characterized as counterproductive results.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.863" offset="14626774">The potential is there but I think we have to test the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.854" offset="14638791">I think the potential will not be realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.130" offset="14651852">I did want to make an observation with respect to the state's complaint that they'll have difficulty administering these evidentiary hearings going to the financial ability of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.472" offset="14701275">I'd always thought that was a basic principle of American law that it's not better to let a man rot in jail because it was easier for the state's administrative machinery to have to dispense with hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.493" offset="14753311">But besides, the lower court judges right now, under the Illinois statutes conduct inquiries into the defendant's background, etcetera in setting bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.957" offset="14787166">There's a statute right now that requires such inquiries, so I don't understand how the state is going to be put to any substantially greater hearings that it engages in right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3681.952" offset="14831156">Well, Mr. Bass, what would you think of an overt system by state or a criminal court system which says where it's determined after investigation that a defendant cannot pay a fine, we just won't impose a fine but we will impose an alternative, what we think is some equivalent jail sentence.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="3706.030" offset="14927496">That's not an equivalent, that's the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.615" offset="14941811">If the state feels that he cannot pay, they still must do something less than putting him in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.267" offset="14968456">A fine is not the equivalent of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.419" offset="14985070">That is obvious and if the state wants to get the revenue, there are ways of collecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.208" offset="15008162">If the state feels that a fine is the type of punishment, that's different from jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.564" offset="15025612">If that's appropriate, then that's the punishment that the state should stick to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.368" offset="15040867">We're not telling the trial judges what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.178" offset="15048077">We're simply talking about the manner in which the state gets that exaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.698" offset="15066154">If the judge determines money is the sanction that should be the sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.129" offset="15083917">I did want to point to a reference in terms of cost, it was estimated that in the City of Chicago between 1907 and 1921, when prison costs were relatively low, the city lost $5 million in uncollected fines and incurred an additional expense in prison maintenance of $5 million, a total cost of $10 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="3782.193" offset="15232188">I'm sorry Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.838" offset="15250683">I believe that the traffic courts have been granting installments on some occasions but I don't have the exact figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.939" offset="15287150">But in terms of the cost problem, the economics of it is not so clear at all that the state will be bankrupted by a ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3816.663" offset="15370010">Well, to the extent to which the offense is punishable by fine only, we would be dealing with the situation of poor people being subjected to a sanction different from the sanction as to rich people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3832.823" offset="15434689">Well, you don't have to reach that in this case, but we would submit --</text>

            <text syncTime="3838.009" offset="15455378">We would submit that if the judge determines that -- well, first of all, if the offense is serious enough to warrant incarceration of an individual would seem to underlie a lot of these, letting an indigence to get away with violating the law with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.803" offset="15510549">This legislature has the ability to set up imprisonment as an alternative but if the offense is not serious enough to require an exaction greater than the fine, there's not justification for putting people in jail simply because they don't have the way with all to pay that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3873.725" offset="15598320">You said the legislature might respond by making greater class, number of classes of crimes subject to imprisonment which are now subject only to fines as a response to a holding that you can't have an alternative for a poor man.</text>

            <text syncTime="3889.943" offset="15663104">Well, it's possible that the legislature has always had the discretion to determine what penalties are appropriate for what offenses but we're talking about this situation is an automatic system that puts people in jail without any inquiry whatsoever as to whether or not the money, that the state says is the appropriate sanction, the fine, can be satisfied in the means less onerous.</text>
