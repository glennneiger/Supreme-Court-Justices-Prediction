            <text syncTime="78.764" offset="418461">The Court accepted the case and appointed a Senior District Judge from the State of Minnesota, the Hon.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.240" offset="452315">Gunnar Nordbye to set as a Special Master in this case, a hearing was held in Memphis, Tennessee in August and September of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.133" offset="503933">The Master entered its report finding against the interest of the State of Arkansas and the case now comes before this Court on exceptions filed by the State of Arkansas to that report and our brief in support thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.077" offset="607692">As a preliminary statement concerning this case, when this case came to the attention of the State of Arkansas, we hired a special counsel, George Cracraft of Helena who is a specialist in this type of field concerning river boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.674" offset="682088">In Arkansas, there are a few specialist in this and we felt that he was specially qualified to handle this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.693" offset="718137">However, after the case was tried and it was briefed to the Master, Mr. Cracraft was elected as a Chancery Judge in 1968 and began his term in August of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.434" offset="777070">We felt that Mr. Cracraft would handle this case for us here before this Court but we discovered a constitutional provision in Arkansas, which is Article 7 Section 25, which prohibit our judges to practice in lo and behold state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.595" offset="849795">The area -- to move on, the area in controversy between the States of Arkansas and Tennessee comprised some 5,000 acres and lies physically on the west bank or the Arkansas side of the main channel, and according to all the evidence that was introduced before the Master, it has been there for at least -- as long as any witness who was presented could recall.</text>

            <label>Mr. Don Langston</label>
            <text syncTime="478.256" offset="2016423">On the part of the acquiescence of our people being out there and he found against the State of Arkansas, we also placed evidence in the record that we built -- that the Crittenden County, Arkansas built roads and our Game and Fish Commission patrol the area for game laws and that our officers -- police officers police the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.085" offset="2147662">As early as 1933, according to the record in this case, some litigation was conducted with regard to this land in the Courts of Tennessee and various claims were made by the citizens of Tennessee to the lands from that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.730" offset="2206281">However, the record we think clearly reflects that no claimant of the State of Tennessee has ever put foot on this ground and not tilt or cut and remove any timber from the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.833" offset="2262706">We believe that if counsel for Tennessee would be completely candid with the Court, they would admit such claims of citizens of Tennessee have ever made the property to the date of this hearing have been paper claims only and that the only actual physical occupation of the area has been accomplished by citizens of the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.360" offset="2352776">We believe that the record is also silent to anything that the State of Tennessee as a sovereign has ever done to improve either the value or the use of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.477" offset="2397288">So, for this background in mind, the officials of Crittenden County, the County Judge, Tax Assessor and other officials over in Crittenden County prevailed on the Attorney General and prevailed upon the Governor of Arkansas to request the Attorney General to bring this suit in the name of the State of Arkansas to determine who owned this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.174" offset="2500106">On the whole case, the Master found the fact of acquiescence which is our -- the citizens of Arkansas being on the land, he found this in favor of the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.924" offset="2555068">And as we understand the function of the Master who was appointed by this Court, these findings are not to be set aside lightly or if there's any basis in evidence at all, this Court will sustain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.798" offset="2618598">We cannot seriously urge that in this -- these exceptions to this Court to set aside those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.946" offset="2659140">And the State of Arkansas Second, form a position, is that even though we haven't acquired the ownership of all this area by the acquiescence power, the exercise complaint dominion and control over it for a long period of time, that certainly a smaller portion of the area, then that claim by the State of Tennessee was actually part of its domain originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.549" offset="2761540">The exception which we do urge is not a factual one but is one of law and the position of the State of Arkansas in these exceptions is that even if the basic facts as found by the Master are true, he applied the incorrect rule of law to the facts in the local state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.853" offset="2842833">That brings us to the first argued point in our brief, which is that the Master erred in concluding that the boundary continued to move as long as the abandoned channel float during high water.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.831" offset="2906676">In this argument on Page 8 of our written brief, the rule is adopted by the Master, which he felt was controlling and I think both sides agree, which is based on a decision in Arkansas versus Tennessee to the effect that though the main channel is a movable one and the channel of navigation in a navigable stream, that after an avulsion and as a result of an avulsion, the change in boundary is not affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.243" offset="3036348">The case rules as stated on Page 8, the effect of an avulsion is not complete until it stagnates and ceases to run and as long as the channel remains a running stream, the boundary marked by it may be moved by an erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.878" offset="3102908">But we contend that when stagnation occurs, the process then is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.123" offset="3131852">We quote from that case, the boundary then becomes fixed in the middle of the channel, as this Court has defined it and the gradual filling up of the bad that ensues is not to be treated as accretion to the shores but as an ultimate effect of the avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.335" offset="3208756">Now the Master in his report while he did recognize this rule and quoted it in his report, has very clearly, erroneously applied the rule in the same manner that Tennessee's principal witness, Mr. Rodgers misapplied it in the quoted testimony on Page 9 of our article.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.935" offset="3311156">Mr. Rodgers states that his entire report as to the location of the land between the two states and the matter is based upon the application of the rule that we -- that I just recited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.248" offset="6948342">That second contention is that the master erred in extending the Tennessee lands laterally down the stream so as to deny Arkansas access to navigable channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.403" offset="7001004">The 2845 of the State of Arkansas is attempting to develop here, is that state lines are supposed to be permanent and supposed to be fixed and suppose to be known and that this Court didn't intend for them remain fluid and movable after one of these avulsions indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.841" offset="7078745">We are saying that this Court wants after an avulsion they want to -- it wants the state line to be set and not be moving and be fluid in depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.976" offset="7119287">That when this Court indicated that it was to become fixed at stagnation, it meant as soon as stagnation but here we are dealing with an exception to the rule rather than the rule and these exceptions should not be permitted to overwrite the rule itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.991" offset="7195355">We think the whole idea is to fix the boundary and to get it fixed as soon as possible, well at the same time preserve whatever rights either party might have and might have lost as a result of the avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.749" offset="7250317">It is not a cure all but simply something to preserve as near as possible the rights of either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.544" offset="7281560">On this point we simply take the position that the Master's finding of fact kept the old channel open too long, should have sedimented in Smith's scar, as our witness Smith did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.855" offset="7338820">Within a few years there after it was low water time and movement that it made after that period would have no effect on the boundary because the boundary became fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.482" offset="7381347">We emphasize that when the stagnation occurred, the old thalweg no longer existed, it was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.757" offset="7406425">The new channel of the river was then the live thalweg and above and below its point of intersection was a dead thalweg, the live thalweg became movable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.351" offset="7448743">We also have emphasize the point that this Court should not permit the dead thalweg which is not alive, which has no life to override and control the live point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2507.001" offset="10131414">What I wanted to explain is that the Mississippi River originally in ancient times flowed straight south upon the great lakes to the gulf, as it did certain things occurred in the bed of the river you would have a rise, you would have hard place so you would have a low over something that would impede that flow and that would force the water either to one side of the other and as it did it would scar the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.877" offset="10250846">And as it scar the bank then of course the water would move along with it and as time progressed it would develop what is known as a bin in the river and around this bin, the best way to understand this it is more like the river with wheel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.435" offset="10333080">This is the rim of the wheel and this is the hook.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.964" offset="10351261">The water flowing around the river with wheel is moving faster than the water around the hook and the movement of the erosion and the accretions that upon by the movement of that swift water occurs around this out of rim and that is where the fast water cuts the bank and chase the water in suspension downstream until it is slow and that is why accretions from on the inner side because the water is flowing slow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.417" offset="10477066">So let us proceed this was a survey by the United States engineers at that time they were known as the Mississippi River Commission and it's a survey so that we know that in 1877, this is the way the river in this area look.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.026" offset="10563480">The next time we were able to find a survey or map was in the year 1904.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.939" offset="10595140">In 1877 to 1904, here again we show the original Tennessee land and now the additional forming of the accretions to the Tennessee shore and the Mississippi river is again cutting further into the State of Arkansas and washing away its lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.114" offset="10683852">Now, I have drawn a red line here to indicate where this Arkansas shore was in 1877, so you can see how far between those two years the Mississippi River actually eroded as the world we use into Arkansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.963" offset="11071195">In other words, the water there is just what they call a bluff bank, it would be very sharply dropped right down to a very deep depth and the boats actually run in close to the shore as they go around this band.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.282" offset="13044485">What I'm trying to get at that when they first began this case the State of Arkansas said there was no avulsion that the river migrated up to the position it is here, then it migrated back down, that is by erosion and accretion and that no avulsion ever occurred and that the river did not stagnate and this is by Mr. Smith, their own witness says, “No, it didn't stagnate it moves out and it moved back.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.667" offset="13186069">They change their position and they said, “Yes, we admit now that it did there was avulsion, that this channel did fall and that the river did not migrate back out as we claim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.249" offset="13248345">See, they first said that it migrated up this way and then came back east to where it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.099" offset="13271751">In the middle of appearing before the Master, they admitted that this avulsion occurred and said that the river instead of migrating back to where it is today migrated on further westward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.935" offset="13323160">They positioned by like that where it stagnated at low water and that's the argument of Arkansas but on that point there are witness on whom they're relying made this statement that is in the record, that the stage of the river has nothing to do with its stagnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.873" offset="13398915">That's his own testimony in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.512" offset="13417409">He says that whether the river is at low water or high water or whatever stage it is, it has nothing to do with its stagnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.136" offset="13451891">Mr. Roger says that it is possible for the river to be moved by erosion and accretions when it gets up to about ordinary high water because that's the line he says where the vegetation ceases, says it possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.881" offset="13522944">Now, he didn't say that that's when it stagnates nor did the Master say that's when it stagnates.</text>

            <text syncTime="4457.611" offset="17933772">You don't have the volume of water nor the velocity of water where the up end is closed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.851" offset="17958745">That is simply the fact that you have water flowing over the top of that, I think they call it river dam into this lower bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.199" offset="17992182">You have water flowing in there but you don't have anything that is active and you don't have any current in there that would create erosion and that has been the case here from sometime prior to 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.411" offset="18052995">Prior to 1929 when it did finally move up there and stopped, it has remained in that same position, since 1929 there has been no change in the old abandoned channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.213" offset="18104195">Before I go further, I would say this that in trying to describe what's going on -- from now on, I would like to use the face of a clock and saying that the beginning point of this (Inaudible) would be at 3 o'clock on the face of a clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.669" offset="18178069">That the top of it would be at 12 o'clock, would be where the channel begins and gets enclosed to the Arkansas shore and remains there on round, and it goes on round from 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 and 6 which is the bottom of the area in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.936" offset="18263124">Now, Your Honor, State of Arkansas has made a statement and furnished you in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.800" offset="18290604">The area that they claim is from which they measure there's two miles downstream and three miles upstream and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.307" offset="18680560">That is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.435" offset="18680456">What they have done in 1913, there was a flood which started this avulsion across here and the purpose there was a man who went out and made a free-hand sketch on an old map showing this channel cut through here do not have water at the same time, he made a general triangular area which he said was the remaining land of Tennessee that was cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.429" offset="18680351">That was during the flood water which was 54 feet at that time and this was the amount of land, all of this pink area, was the amount of land that was visible above those flood waters in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.176" offset="18680247">The State of Arkansas has taken the extreme North part of that 1913 high water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.045" offset="18680142">I remember this that this land at that moment in 1913 was much larger and this picture shows as the river comes up, it covers more of the edge of the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.305" offset="18680038">So naturally you don't have as much land sticking out of the water but when the river went back down all of this land appeared again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.504" offset="18679933">But the State of Arkansas takes the land of the river in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.234" offset="18679829">I remember this is 1930, they draw across this 1925 land and color that and say that's all the land that Tennessee had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.982" offset="18687352">In 1913, the land was there like it shows in 1912 except that this area has become enlarged but they have taken a free-hand sketch, they try to use that as a survey, and they try to tell us that was the land that we had in 1925 because in 1925 the new channel, this is the new channel in 1925, had eroded away the bottom part of those Tennessee accretions up to this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.546" offset="18853595">Now of course, at the same time, this river is moving up, these accretions are filling in here and they just forget all about the fact that their accretions here and say that this original piece of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.358" offset="18900825">In other words, it's two miles downstream and is two miles over this way, is from that little piece of land that he took off from a flood map in 1930, then he used the 1925 map to try to limit the boundaries of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.243" offset="18964355">Now, in 1925, the new river -- the new channel only now, remember the abandoned channel is showing here as stagnated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.800" offset="19018585">It's still -- it's in this position and shows on the 1929 map.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.138" offset="19039901">But in 1925, the new channel did come up and rolled away so that the lower part became reactivated that is the lower part.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.395" offset="19092982">Now there you have the difference between what we have described as a channel of the river where water comes up in it and high water and it is subject to movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.029" offset="19139480">Well, it's only if it becomes active as a channel and here it did become active.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.701" offset="19166124">Now, what happened because of that active point?</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.093" offset="19191724">The river coming around here actually eat just a little bit more over in Arkansas, just a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.952" offset="19227146">Now, it's their position and this is the point that when the river became active to this point and then reversed itself and started back down which I will show you later, that the state line left the active channel, it left out at a 90-degree angle to this shoreline of the new channel that it left and went out across like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.555" offset="19353579">Now, this Court has said that the state line remains in the old channel unless it's moved.</text>

            <text syncTime="5479.008" offset="22019427">The purpose of putting this map in here this island or this piece of land that belongs to Tennessee is drawn in this particular map by the man from Arkansas and he shows the old abandoned channel in between it and the Arkansas shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.330" offset="22092675">Now, that is in 1921 and there's other times, when the state of Arkansas says there were no maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.750" offset="22130395">They did not present this map to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.333" offset="22140740">They did not use it in any of their deliberations at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.817" offset="22154637">They had to come out by the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.899" offset="22166967">Because of the limited time I would like to proceed on rather swiftly with the presentation of the picture from these maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.698" offset="22206151">After 1929, the next official map that had survey on it was 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.959" offset="22255156">And as you can see, some of the low channel, the active channel or the avulsion channel had again cut back here a little bit but it had put a little tail than here but if you will notice that that land adds only to Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.010" offset="22339375">It does not touch Arkansas at any place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.175" offset="22352123">It was never formed in any part of Arkansas nor on this side of the old gateway channel that has again become inactive as the new channel moved away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.406" offset="22424952">The next year on which there was a survey was 1949 and this one you will notice that the land here has increased in size greatly because the avulsion channel has moved south and washed away a great deal of the original Tennessee land, put it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.814" offset="22506663">Now, that's where it gets to that approximately four or five thousand acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.345" offset="22524740">But again in the next period of time which is 1965 and the survey in 1967, you will notice at a great deal of that has again been washed away by the new channel and this is a situation as it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.927" offset="22607078">Now, the only change for this land between 1929 which was right, here is the addition of this little piece right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.079" offset="22651695">Always with the river between it and the Arkansas shore, at all times this land had remained there and had never moved and never come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.045" offset="22695581">This land simply added on to the Tennessee shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.491" offset="22709373">Now, that's what he's talking about tailing down the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.642" offset="22721912">Well, of course at this time, here is the river and the new channel is the thing it is moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.033" offset="22759528">Now, the point of law is that irrespective of the movement of the new channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.815" offset="22782621">The state line remains in that old channel unless it becomes active again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.882" offset="22806862">Now, I would like to wind this up by making some statements, first about the claim of prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.260" offset="22848449">There is no evidence in this case that Tennessee ever acquiesced in the State of Arkansas claim of sovereignty over this particular land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5699.590" offset="22901739">Note that the Master found to that no evidence that they ever acquiesced and as far as prescription is concerned, they can of course obtain the control of this land if Tennessee acquiesced in their control to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.128" offset="22971852">The record is replete here with law suits from 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.960" offset="22995257">In 1932, there was a suit in the Federal District Court at Memphis to determine, if this is part of the same area of land, right here was either in Tennessee or Arkansas and it was so held that was in Tennessee in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.301" offset="23064534">That was a suit between first in Arkansas and one in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.388" offset="23080939">Then we have the series of suits beginning in 1949 coming clear to date, all in the Tennessee Courts where citizens of Tennessee are recognized by the Courts of Tennessee as being the owners of that land.</text>
