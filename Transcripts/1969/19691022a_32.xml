            <label>Mr. Arnold Ordman</label>
            <text syncTime="64.917" offset="363081">Yes, the company predicates much of his defense on a letter it wrote in November 7, 1957 about two months after the enforcing decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.196" offset="404146">It wrote the Board a letter saying in essence, “we have complied with some of the provisions of the Board’s order, now, will you please notify us of any instances where we have not complied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="91.423" offset="469034">And the company says on that basis since we didn’t notify them, they weren’t obliged to comply any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.767" offset="490454">Well, the court below said an offending respondent which has the primary obligation to comply can’t rid of itself of its obligation merely by saying you didn’t tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.164" offset="532041">The court had told what they are obliged to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.044" offset="547506">In addition, frankly, we have a situation where as of this day, there is still a number or at least of the date of the hearing and I believe that is still true, there are still the number of strikers who have not been offered reinstatement, whose back pay claims after the litigation have been validated.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.100" offset="623783">And to this day, not one cent of back pay has been paid on this claims which the Board and the court below validated.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.955" offset="659205">Moreover, we notified the --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="142.474" offset="673311">Why is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="144.479" offset="681253">You said they have agreed, that they are valid and they haven’t been paid, why is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="147.584" offset="693687">What ground is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arnold_ordman" startTime="148.795" stopTime="397.584">
            <label>Mr. Arnold Ordman</label>
            <text syncTime="148.795" offset="698598">I presume the, I presume the company must be of the waiting the outcome of this proceeding which only has to do with cutting back the back pay not eliminating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.214" offset="744260">This Court denied cert on the part, denied certiorari on the portion of the order that was enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.020" offset="775502">Now also, this company was rather familiar as the Court below says this Company was not a babe in the woods, and I think the language of the Court is significant in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.662" offset="825971">And said this company, this company is not a babe in the woods and the principle theory of premise upon which the court below limited the back pay was on the ground that the court below, the court below felt that somehow the company had been lulled into a sense by the Board’s delay into a sense that maybe it had nothing left to do and that it had no obligations anymore by the Board’s delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.707" offset="954180">Well, this might come with more grace I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.135" offset="971943">With an unsophisticated employer, but this is what the court below said, “the record convinces us that Rutter-Rex is not a babe in the woods about to be victimized for ignorance or inadvertent ineptitude in the field of employer-employee relations as regulated by the National Labor Relations Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="240.581" offset="1065671">The order in this case which directed immediate reinstatement of strikers even if they had to hire replacements who were still employed by the company although not all strikers have been replaced, the order the court below said just could not have been misunderstood but as of today, that reinstatement obligation has not yet been full carried out and the back pay has been -- none of the back pay has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.561" offset="1173608">And as the Trial Examiner pointed out, at the time of the back pay hearing, replacements were still working and much of the back pay hearing of this long back pay hearing was devoted to analyzing the back pay do strikers where replacements were still working at the job the strikers should have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.609" offset="1265768">Now, the record demonstrates as I said before and this is the court’s language, as it was and the impossible for the company to comply and as to many individuals it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.814" offset="1310595">We think that in this situation, with this kind of sophisticated company in the area of labor relations and also represented as the court below noted by able counsel that they weren’t lulled into any sense that they’d already complied with the decree of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.751" offset="1390425">On the contrary, we believe that to just -- to affirm the Board’s -- the court’s order below would be to really reward a malingering and an intransigent refusal to comply with the Board order and a court decree at the expense of the public policy, the Act is designed to bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.990" offset="1491362">I might say in regard to that letter also where this, the company tried to shelve its responsibility by a couple of months after the decree said you tell us when we violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.072" offset="1539636">And now we routinely send a letter and we sent a letter right after this decree to this respondent saying we’re ready to help you comply with this order and incidentally when you have complied, we will send you a letter notifying you that the compliance has been affected and the case close.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.709" offset="1622183">And we also incidentally in case the company had any doubts, it had just received such a letter in an earlier unfair labor practice case where we told them, in this case you have complied and the case is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.577" offset="1677667">We never send a closing compliance letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.927" offset="2979088">The fact to the matter was that this record and the public record demonstrates that the Court, that the Board at this time was undermanned, overloaded with cases which is this Board knows, the Board initiates no cases, cases brought to it and that we had this case and we had four other compliance cases of a similar nature already pending when this decree came out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.355" offset="4120743">Promptly, upon the issuance of the Board of the enforcing opinion of the Fifth Circuit, the employer submitted a report to the Board in which it gave payroll information, the job classifications, operations numbers, strike list, the names of those persons who had applied for reinstatement and the date upon which they had been reinstated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1225.662" offset="5005981">Yes, but the point that I’m trying to make Mr. Justice Marshall is that we had a legal issue in our minds as to whether or not we were obligated to prejudice the earnings of 14 operators in a 15-operator line by the fact that we had an application from someone whose capabilities did not measure up to the engineering of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.648" offset="5105977">Now, whether we were right on that or not, I say is pre- admitted at this time because the fact is the court said specifically that the availability of work at various times considering the nature of this engineer -- of this manufacturing operations, this raised questions which had to be resolved in further and future administrative proceeding before the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1293.172" offset="5276087">Even the Board in its post hoc, critical second guessing of what we did concedes that we complied with 70% of the cases that they say that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.073" offset="5327705">We did not stand fast and refuse to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.206" offset="5340244">We did comply and we took people on as we could work them into these operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.789" offset="5366575">We had other problems, for instance, there was this problem and again I’m not arguing today that I am right, I’m simply arguing that this was a problem on this point that the Union submitted letters in which they listed the names of the strikers who wish to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.390" offset="5436897">We responded and said in an orderly rebuilding process, we would ask that you send people in at 20 a day so we can work them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.695" offset="5478170">They wrote back and said we’ll do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.402" offset="5493008">Now, they say and I must say that’s too late to argue about the correctness of it, they say that this did not invalidate the original application of which they say was effective even though they agree to send people in but it has left us because we thought that the people who were interested in their jobs would come into the plant as the Union had said they would in its letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.975" offset="5599274">And in many instances, the problems which the company has today resulted from the fact that persons who did not show their availability were ultimately held by the Board to have been entitled to reinstatement by virtue of the Union letter of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.779" offset="5670536">I referred to that not to reargue that point but simply to demonstrate another area in which there was doubt, another area in which this author was indefinite, and another area in which he’d require administrative definition by the Board which was not forthcoming.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.603" offset="8469817">I’m reading from page 55 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.723" offset="8486222">The Examiner having ultimately ruled that none of this issues were properly before him for our disposition in accordance with this ruling having refused absence -- absence to proffer of evidence of wrongful or unlawful conduct on the part of the general counsel which was not forthcoming to permit the parties fully to develop the facts regarding delay I interpret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.128" offset="8583920">And when the Fifth Circuit then, when the company complains about the fact that the Board didn’t take delay into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.907" offset="8626970">The Board comes into the Fifth Circuit and takes diametrically opposed positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.680" offset="8650062">It says that time in this proceeding that we are reviewing here now, it says no unreasonable delay occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.653" offset="8686007">If it did, it’s up to us and our discretion to assess it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.530" offset="8705442">It’s up to us to decide what if anything to do about it and the limited judicial appellate procedure available to you doesn’t accord the Fifth Circuit the right to do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.259" offset="8760404">And it says furthermore, even if the Fifth Circuit had the right to review our decisions in the delayed area, it cannot do it because if it does, its applying the doctrine of laches to defeat a public right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.190" offset="8824142">Now, I submit to the Court that this position on the part of the Board is wrong and a number of very serious ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.625" offset="8865834">In the first place, I do not accept the fact that the statutory scheme whether we’d be talking about the National Labor Relations Act or whether we’re talking about the Administrative Procedure Act contemplates according by the administrative agency the right to judge itself fully, finally without review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.546" offset="8957576">It may have the right, in certain areas of expertise, in which it’s assumed that they have expert knowledge to judge the actions of litigants before it but it has no expertise when it comes to judging its own derelictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.299" offset="9028524">I say the Board is wrong about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.816" offset="9038660">And secondly, on the question of laches, it’s a principle case relied upon by the Board is Electric Vacuum Cleaner decision to this Court and although it doesn’t appear in the decision here and it doesn’t appear in the Circuit Court decision the Electric Vacuum Cleaner, I would like to call the Court’s attention to the proceedings before the Board which I found, they’re not in my brief but I found them in volume 101 of the transcripts of records and copies of brief for the October term 1941, I think its docket number 588.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.407" offset="9189021">I found the Board proceeding in that case and the Board has done in that case precisely what it says, the Fifth Circuit can’t do in this and this is how that case came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.710" offset="9246177">In the Electric Vacuum Cleaner case, the Board issued a complaint and then 13 months later it issued a finding of some sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.269" offset="9300407">The company complained about the fact that there was a 13 months delay and it also complained about the fact that the Board hadn’t issued an intermediate report which procedurally it was suppose to have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.475" offset="9361324">The company filed a petition for review under Section 10 (f) of the Labor Act just as we have done here and the Board seeing what was developing withdrew its order which the company sought to review and then moved to dismiss the petition to review because there was nothing to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.078" offset="9455679">Sometime later, I think it was, well I don’t remember the exact date but it was sometime later on that the Board then issued a new order and because of what its secretary said in that record was an administrative error on the part of the Board and because of what the company claimed was undue delay, the Board excluded from the back pay period a nine-month period and exactly in the same fashion as the Fifth Circuit has done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.950" offset="9587127">Now, that position which the Board took in Electric Vacuum Cleaner in the Board proceeding was consistent with the position which the Board took in the injunction case in the Fifth Circuit because at that time, there was no talk whatsoever about the inability of the Board to take its own delays into consideration of fashion a back pay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.581" offset="9693706">In substance, we say that the Board should not be permitted to issue orders which require further definition than waiting inordinate length of time before initiating the administrative procedure which is required to define the company’s obligation and then second guess the company on what it did -- what it did in its reinstatement program in the meantime, that’s our basic complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.133" offset="9859950">I started to make a reference to something I consider important and I would like to say it briefly because it’s not in my brief and that is I want to make a reference to Section 101.16 of the Board’s rules which provide that after a Board order directing payment of back pay has been issued or after enforcement of such order by a court decree, if in formal efforts to dispose of the matter proved unsuccessful the regional director -- regional director is then authorize at his discretion to issue a back pay specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.762" offset="10014386">I consider that significant because they didn’t, they made no effort to work this out with us at all, they simply went in and file the specification seeking $342,000 in November 1961, four years and four months after the opinion of the Fifth Circuit enforcing the decree of reinstatement with the reservation which I have referred to and the compliance officer for the Board testified at the hearing that he knew that our letter that was in the record asking to be advised of any deviation from the obligations of compliance, we were on the record as wanting to comply and he did not make any effort to discuss with us and an informal resolution of all of the problems which were -- which have to be resolved before there could be a clear definition of what the Board order require.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.248" offset="10312391">In the hearing before the examiner and before the Court, so that’s 45 people that we were right about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.146" offset="10351992">The Board order reduced the amount to approximately 162,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.960" offset="10375189">The order of the Fifth Circuit reduced it to about 90,000 or 95,000 but there is interest running since 1964 so that I make a rough approximation of the company’s obligation if it wins this case is still somewhere in the neighborhood of a $140,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.125" offset="10475917">Now, if we lose this case, what the Board intends to do is go back and file another specification and try to exact back pay from 1961 to date I presume.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.267" offset="10652400">Now, I took the position that this meant, that this was prospective in nature, but we couldn’t reinstate immediately somebody who had applied a year before the Board order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.306" offset="10700570">So we took the position in the Fifth Circuit in an attempt to win the case completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.901" offset="10722931">That if, that we were only responsible to reinstate those people who applied prospectively or after the date of the order, but we lost on that unfortunately, but that is the basis of the contention that I made at that junction that we didn’t know the minute it was on the basis of the interpretation of the order which I think has some relevance here as well because its another indefinite aspect of the order.</text>
