            <text syncTime="23.489" offset="197360">The appeal here before this Court, is from a judgment of the three-judge court of the United States District Court with the Central District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.476" offset="237275">The jurisdiction of the Court is grounded upon Section 1253 of the Title 28 of United States Codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.211" offset="264234">The appellants are in the mail order business.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.927" offset="279071">They are distributors and disseminators of books, pamphlets, various matters and materials that traffic and conduct its way through the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.126" offset="331839">The law which is brought here on focus by this appeal is Section 301 of the Public Law 90206 or is codified 39 US Code 4009.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.653" offset="378023">The action below was that for declaratory relief and seeking an injunction against the enforcement, implementation, and administration of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.623" offset="421909">The result in the court below was a verdict of three to nothing, upholding the constitutionality of the statute and denying the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.062" offset="471646">Upon this appeal, it does seem that the issues are made much clear then they were even in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.367" offset="500799">This is come to be because a statute which reportedly was not an ambiguous has now received the same interpretation by the Government as well as the appellants herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.655" offset="557955">Well, interpretation is contrary to the construction inter -- and the interpretation given by the US District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.748" offset="1010395">They were quite conscious to the legislative history and the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.070" offset="1035682">The statute itself, involves the mailing of materials or advertising which maybe turned off by a recipient, if that recipient in his sole discretion determines that it is a erotically arousing or sexually provocative.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.978" offset="1123244">Upon making such a discretionary determination, the recipient may obtain a prohibitory order from the Post Office Department issued against the mailer, his assigns or his agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.493" offset="1185311">That order or the contents of the order are set forth in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.990" offset="1275382">He shall direct the mailer to remove from any list in his possession or under his control or the under the control of his agents or assigns the name of such a complaining addressee.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.330" offset="1892707">That certainly is one of the principal issues in this case and an answer to that Mr. Chief Justice, I believe there are several of facets.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.323" offset="1924681">I believe that the under First Amendment, the free expression through the mails is of more paramount right, the more fundamental right within the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.464" offset="1981210">So hence, if we must create polarity between what has been termed as the right of privacy which I believe you elude to, the answer of appellants is that the free speech is far more paramount and must override that aspect of the recipient saying, “I do not want or I have a right not to receive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="491.977" offset="2071280">In addition, we submit however and I think this is more fundamental, that assuming arguendo that a recipient does has have such a right, this statute goes too far, too fast and hence we are never met by the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.268" offset="2140453">I submit that this is an issue created by the Government in saying that right of privacy has now being polarized with free speech, but I believe that there are too many pitfalls before we arrive at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.147" offset="2275976">I believe that each mode of communication as this Court has said, in a sense spins upon its own peculiarly or on its own way and must be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.115" offset="2315786">I believe in this complex, urban society in which we reside, the mails are a very important vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.718" offset="12006275">And I think the reason for the difficulties in the other cases is that decision of a majority or a single could affect what every man wanted to receive and that situation does not happen it here.</text>
