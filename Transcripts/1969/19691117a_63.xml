            <text syncTime="13.905" offset="159013">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.898" offset="182941">This is a federal tax case involving the application of the Social Security Old Age Tax and the Federal Unemployment Tax to the owners of ships with respect to captains and crew members who fish off the South Atlantic Coast and the Gulf of Mexico for Manhattan.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.607" offset="297775">Manhattan are a frequently encountered fish which is not regarded as edible by humans, but which is caught in large quantities and processed into fish meal and fish oil which are used primarily for fertilizer or for feeding poultry and other livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.724" offset="418252">The case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.289" offset="476557">The statutory provisions involved are set forth in the appendix to the Government's brief at pages 39 to 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.208" offset="520234">Before stating the facts, it will be helpful I think to put the precise terms of the statute before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.424" offset="565060">The Old Age Tax is imposed by Section 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code and is in terms at equal to the following percentage of the wages paid by him with respect to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.379" offset="640920">And then in Section 3121, the term wages is defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.808" offset="666624">Now, wages means all remuneration for employment and then in 3121 (d), there is a definition of the term employee to include any individual who under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship has the status of an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.039" offset="791489">In this setting out in our brief of the statutory provisions, we omitted one at this point which may have some conceivable application.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.153" offset="848018">It is in Section 3121 (b) (4) and it provides that employment shall not include services performed by an individual on or in connection with a vessel, not an American vessel or in connect or in connection with an aircraft, not an American aircraft, if (a) the individual is employed on and in connection with such vessel or aircraft went outside the United States and (b) such individual is not a citizen of the United States or the employer is not an American employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.780" offset="1018441">Now, that's entirely an exclusionary provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.001" offset="1031398">It leaves only the inference that it was intended to apply to American citizens employed on American vessels by -- owned by American owners --</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="250.537" offset="1105481">3121 (b) (4) contains a negative pregnant that Americans employed on American owned vessels are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.852" offset="1166817">I would say as Mr. Lyman will remind you that that is still subject to the definition of employment or employee in Section 3121 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="281.004" offset="1227421">Now, that's the Old Age Tax, there is also an Unemployment Insurance Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.842" offset="1246751">The Old Age Tax you will recall is imposed on both the employer and the employee with the employer under obligation to withhold the employee's share and pay over the total to the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.914" offset="1311013">The Unemployment Tax is imposed only on the employer and there again, it is imposed at a percentage of the total wages paid by him during the calendar year with respect to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.732" offset="1374333">This appears on page 40 in the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.258" offset="1396381">The term wages is defined to mean all remuneration for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.390" offset="1420936">And again, we have the term employment defined here saying there's somewhat more complicated manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.082" offset="1455731">Employment is defined as any service performed -- any service of whatever nature performed after 1954 by an employee for the person employing him; (b) on or in connection with an American vessel and then you come to the end of that at the top of page 41, except and this gets very involved because this exception I'm about to state is then subject to an exception itself, except service performed by an individual in or as an officer or a member of the crew of a vessel while it is engaged in the catching, harvesting, cultivating or farming of any kind of fish, shellfish and so on and here's the next exception, except (b) service performed on or in connection with a vessel of more than ten tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.474" offset="1713298">So they take out all fishing, but then they except from that take out service on vessels of more than ten tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.053" offset="1747571">And all of the vessels involved in this case were of more than ten tons so that it comes within the exception to the exception and thus is included in the definition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.386" offset="1796890">But again, it's subject to the provision in Section 3306 (i) that for purposes of this chapter, the term employee includes an officer of a corporation, but does not include any individual who under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship has the status of an independent contractor or (2) any individual who is not an employee under such common law rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.808" offset="1946624">Now, that is the statutory setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.586" offset="1977762">It is part of a large whole but one can focus rather closely on those provisions; one in the Old Age Tax and one in the Unemployment Tax which -- by which Congress has emphasized that the test of employment is the common law -- the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="500.686" offset="2106075">Mr. Solicitor General, as I read this now under your guidance, I gather that we come right down with respect to both taxes to the definition of employee in each case, don't we?</text>
            <text syncTime="517.167" offset="2172008">In other words, this definition of unemployment under the second tax, we really end up that the door by which we're heading, it doesn't add or subtract much of anything, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="528.714" offset="2218193">I think -- I think that's exactly it except that I would say that this definition comes as a piece of a mosaic which also includes some references to fishing and ships and boats of more than ten tons and thus, it is perfectly plain that Congress did not intend to exclude employment on the ship such as are involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.012" offset="2483388">Now, this case was tried before the District Court without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.629" offset="2505853">There was an extensive stipulation of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.929" offset="2523094">There were also depositions and evidence on all of which, the District Court made findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.074" offset="2563636">The underlying facts are essentially not in dispute and they maybe summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.546" offset="2613582">The fishing involved in this case was partly in the South Atlantic Coast and partly in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.322" offset="2652662">There are 14 respondents in five cases which were consolidated in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.928" offset="2683068">Each owns one or more boats which Fish for Manhattan, their cost varying between $24,000.00 and $157,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.589" offset="2733746">In other words, the respondents all have substantial capital invested in the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.602" offset="2765824">The respondents sell the fish to processing plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.750" offset="2798320">The respondents who not only own the boats, keep them fully equipped, paid for all their repairs and paid for insurance on the boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.143" offset="2847953">They paid for fuel for the boats, all of the fuel for the boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.525" offset="2869478">The method of operation was one which has an ancient history in the fishing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.844" offset="2894764">It seems to go back three or four centuries at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.956" offset="2907199">It's called the “lay system.”</text>
            <text syncTime="703.708" offset="2918170">There are some variations, but the owner of the boat from people whom he knows secures the services of an experienced fishermen as a captain of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.308" offset="2980655">He is selected because of his honesty and experience and his ability to enlist and organize and supervise a crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.407" offset="3045021">When the captain has been chosen, he arranges a crew and here I would like to turn to some of the findings of the District Court so that there can be no suggestion that I am not representing the facts adequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.457" offset="3133210">Finding 13 on page 320 of the record, the arrangement between the plaintiffs and each captain was entirely oral.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.576" offset="3177723">The term of the arrangement was not specified, but it was understood to persist for a fishing season.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.231" offset="3204263">It could be terminated by either party voluntarily or involuntarily at the conclusion of any trip during the season.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.399" offset="3240939">That seems to me to show a great potentiality for a control by the boat owners, but this could occur only when a boat was in port and before another fishing trip was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.968" offset="3295274">While the arrangement could be so terminated, custom and practice was for it to be continued for the season.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.709" offset="3518255">They occasionally were longer in the South Atlantic, particularly in the winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.732" offset="3538317">At this time, there were not refrigerated ships although there are now and the controlling factor, the Manhattan being quickly perishable, the controlling factor was the temperature.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.881" offset="3586905">In the Gulf, the temperature is always high and the trips were one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.957" offset="3611251">The evidence shows that in the South Atlantic, they occasionally lasted three or four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.065" offset="3631626">They were ordinarily short trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.986" offset="3643329">Now I call attention to finding 22 on page 323.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.765" offset="3666422">In negotiating for the service of a captain, it was understood that the captain would select the crew members.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.243" offset="3692335">Prior to commencement of a new season, the tax payers who are the boat owners and the respondents here would furnish the captain with the pay scale of crew members and the crew size to be employed for the season.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.386" offset="3752939">If a bonus was to be paid for fishing the entire season, this information also was furnished to captains.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.346" offset="3784808">So I point out that the owners here fixed the -- I can't quite say the rate of pay because under the lay system, the men are paid so much for a thousand pounds of the catch but they fix the rate per thousand pounds that the men were to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.813" offset="3886582">And then I call attention to finding 24 on page 324, defendant contended and the plaintiff denied that the captain was required to pay a crew member not less than the scale established by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.180" offset="3956067">The testimony of the various captains leave no doubt that the plaintiff not only fixed the pay scale of the crew, but also the number of the crewmen to be hired and finally of the findings, I would refer to finding 46 on page 333.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.710" offset="4042167">The plaintiffs did have the right to control the results of a captain's work and interfered in the process to some degree to assure a proper result from the undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.442" offset="4101099">Next, I would like to point out that the evidence is clear that the captains were required to obtain from each crewman, the evidence says a W-2 form, but the W-2 form is the one by which you report to the individual at the end of the year what has been withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.698" offset="4202141">It is actually this familiar W-4 form which is the employee's withholding exemption certificate and then it was also a part of the procedure duly established and carried out that the captains at the end of each trip turned in the data with respect to the crewmen showing which crewmen had served and what the amount of the catch had been and what the rate per thousand pounds was for each crewman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.744" offset="4346337">And in our reply brief, we have reproduced exhibits one and two which were introduced into evidence in the court below and about which there is no controversy or dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.648" offset="4413942">These show that for each individual, what is headed at the top a payroll and they show the amount of fish caught, the rate for each man, the total payment, the Social Security Tax withheld, the income tax withheld, the amount deducted for each individual for his share of the cost of food because the crewmen paid for the food, the amount deducted for advances which had previously been made, the other deductions which were because as I understand it, the crewmen paid $5.00 each to provide the pay of the cook -- the cook being thought of as providing their meals which were their responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.608" offset="4613831">Finally, the balance and then also at the bottom of the second sheet of exhibit one are shown the other checks which were issued which included payment for the food and these under -- according to the record were all the ship owner's checks, the respondent's checks here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.976" offset="4711320">They got all the money and they paid all the bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.469" offset="4729292">And finally, exhibit two which is at the back shows the individual record which was kept for each member of the crew, again showing these deductions which are aggregated at the bottom of the page for the whole year so that they could be duly reported to the individual on the form W-2 the amount of deductions for Social Security Tax, for income tax and for other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.944" offset="4871189">Now, let me point out that this -- the fact that this case is here, it seems to me to be an instance of the difficulty we sometimes get into in this country in administering relatively simple matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.886" offset="4954885">It is nearly 30 years ago that the treasury issued a ruling with respect to this situation saying that captains and crewmen operating under the lay system are employees and are subject to the Social Security Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.836" offset="5042761">This is SST Social Security Tax 387 which was published in the Accumulative Bulletin for 1940 Volume 1 and this is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.312" offset="5112665">In addition, this Court had decided cases like the Silt Case in 331 US which involved another group of relatively simple workmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.677" offset="5178075">They were coal unloaders there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.917" offset="5191032">They furnished their own picks and shovels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.514" offset="5201377">In this case, the men furnished nothing except their foul weather gear which would be boots and raincoats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.275" offset="5240456">In the Silt Case, this Court reversed both of the lower courts and held that the coal unloaders were employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.135" offset="5279953">In addition to the Silt Case, there are of course many cases under the Fair Labor Standards Act and under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.288" offset="5320495">Now, it will be said by Mr. Lyman that neither the Silt Case nor SST 387 are relevant because they were both issued before the Congress amended the statute in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.710" offset="5374203">And it was in 1948 that Congress put in this language about the common law test to which Mr. Justice Stewart referred awhile ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.547" offset="5421537">But as is pointed in our brief at the time that Congress put this into the statute, the legislative history plainly showed that Congress was endorsing the Silt Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.636" offset="5493948">It referred to the -- on page 15 of our brief is a quotation from the Senate Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.691" offset="5550164">In the view of your committee, these decisions affirm that the usual common law rules realistically applied must be used to determine whether a person is an employee for purposes of applying the Social Security Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.696" offset="5614111">And in 1950, two years later referring to the situation, the House -- the Conference Report said a restricted view of the employer-employee relationship should not be taken in the administration of the federal old age and survivors' insurance system in making coverage determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.347" offset="5724766">So I find nothing to indicate that the language of the statute put in 1948 was intended to repeal or overrule the Silt Case, nothing to indicate that the early administrative interpretation should not be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.047" offset="5803551">I would point out that we are here dealing with a maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.597" offset="5821733">We're necessarily concerned with the customs of the sea and the law of the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.627" offset="5853915">Under the law of the sea it's perfectly plain that this captains and crewmen would be entitled to maintenance and cure, would be entitled to a protection under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.797" offset="5910549">The proposition that captains and crews under the lay system are employees for purposes of the Social Security Taxes has been accepted by the Court of Claims in two cases, cited at page 37 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.153" offset="5984005">One involving fishing for scallops from New Bedford and the other involving fishing for shrimp and oysters in the Gulf of Mexico and also by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirming per curiam in opinion by Judge Genio in the District of Maine involving a fishing trawler operating out of Portland, Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.793" offset="6082539">The only problem has been in the Fifth Circuit and there are things got off to a bad start in Enochs against the Williams Packing and Navigation Company, cited on page 37 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.676" offset="6142098">That was a suit to enjoin the collection of these taxes in circumstances essentially the same as those here and both the District Court and the Court of Appeals in the Enochs case allowed the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.939" offset="6207091">That involved, as far as both courts were concerned, a determination that these people were not employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.247" offset="6236348">When the case came here, this Court reversed, holding that it was not appropriate to disregard the statute and ignore the restriction on injunctions against the collection of taxes, but there is that left standing the rest of the Fifth Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.253" offset="6324433">And in the Crawford Packing case, cited on page 37 and in this case, the Court of Appeals has understandably continued to follow its decision in the Enochs' case, otherwise repudiated by this Court that these people were not employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.738" offset="6402278">Now, even under the common law test, even if it's given a narrow construction, we contend that these captains and crewmen came within.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.510" offset="6441462">Here, all of the capital came from the ship owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.235" offset="6452328">They owned the ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.521" offset="6457448">They paid for their repairs and for their fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.867" offset="6470823">They paid for the nets which cost some $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.826" offset="6486706">All the men provided was their foul weather gear, boots and slickers and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.576" offset="6509693">They did not even provide picks and shovels as in the Silt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.458" offset="6529233">The rate of compensation of the captains and crews was fixed by the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.477" offset="6545324">The size of the crews were determined by the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.835" offset="6558699">The captains could change this, but only at the expense of themselves or of all the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.846" offset="6582732">The owners were the entrepreneurs, they were in charge, they fixed the pay scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.821" offset="6610631">The owners paid the bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.957" offset="6619199">They were the only ones that had money in hand for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.723" offset="6634245">They took out insurance and took the gain of the price when fish went up and took the risk of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.735" offset="6662353">They were clearly in-charge and that should be enough when the statute is realistically applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.263" offset="6688475">Even under a strict view of the common law test and when this question arises in the maritime setting as it does here, that conclusion becomes even more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.760" offset="6738422">There are three ways it seems to me that this case can be decided; one is practical and workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.564" offset="6769664">The others lead only to uncertainty and confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.315" offset="6784606">Now first, the Court can hold that the captains and the crews were the employee's of the owners thus reversing the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.565" offset="6821595">That's what the parties actually did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.535" offset="6833507">That makes the Social Security System realistic and workable as applied to these workers who have no capital investment, no management of the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.553" offset="6873631">That puts the paperwork of withholding and tax paying work and practically be handled as it was handled in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.671" offset="6906023">Or second, the Court can hold that the captains and crews are not employees of the ship owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.965" offset="6931205">That would eliminate withholding of income tax under of worker's share Old Age Tax and it would eliminate payment of Old Age Tax and Unemployment Tax by the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.957" offset="6975195">This can be set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.041" offset="6983555">People would know where they stood, but it would mean that the captains and the crews would have to pay their income tax without withholding and would have to pay self employment tax at an increased rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2013.450" offset="8157184">Well, the sole issue before the District Court was whether the boat owners, also the respondents here reliable for the excise tax portion of the employment taxes imposed on their earnings of the fishermen and that's the captains and the crewmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.106" offset="8227819">Now, the respondent's liability or non-liability for these taxes depended upon the definition of the term employee and that term is defined in two sections of the Internal Revenue Code, both of which adopt the common law control test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.619" offset="8297827">Now, the trial court held that the tax per owners had proved their claims for refund and as a consequence, the fishermen were not their employees under those statutes, for other purposes it may have been, but under those statutes, they weren't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.912" offset="10970990">So in summary, the captains participated in bilateral decisions and negotiations in fixing the price and they exercised a high degree of independence in conducting their operations and exercised initiative and decision making authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.606" offset="11033788">Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, I -- you're absolutely correct in that respect because one of the points I believe that petitioner raises and petitioner raised numerous points and we did our best to brief each one thoroughly, but we think two points raised in the main brief and one in the reply brief suggest a discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.339" offset="11120724">The first is in evaluation of the relationship here between the boat owner and the fishermen for these tax purposes, what legal standard should be applied?</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.322" offset="11156668">The principles of general Maritime Law as they contend, or the principles of the common law in the statute as we contend?</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.255" offset="11184358">The second point was assuming the petitioner's contention that this case involves a mixed question of law and fact, would that circumstance call for a different result and not reached by the concurrent decisions below?</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.843" offset="11234722">Now in the reply brief if the Court please, there was a new point raised and it poses this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.434" offset="11269099">Is proof of filing an employment tax return and the payment of the tax a defense against a suit for its refund?</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.711" offset="11314239">Now, we didn't get a chance to brief that for the Court because the reply brief was served on us I think only Thursday or Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.236" offset="11348302">I want to discuss that briefly here if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.910" offset="11363035">At pages four through six which is point three of the reply brief, the petitioner says that because the respondents filed employment tax returns and paid the taxes and kept good records, the respondents thought or believed that the captains and crewmen were their employees and for that reason, our suit for refund should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.317" offset="11472645">Now, if belief is to be a criteria of employment status, it's material only when one party believes that he has the right to control and direct the activities of another and the other believes that he must submit to that control, but I find it puzzling how filing a tax return can come to that same arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.303" offset="11572537">Now, people pay taxes and file returns for many reasons and I don't think that they ponder legal concepts when they're about to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.848" offset="11606810">Now suppose the respondents here had made their own determinations and decided that the fishermen were independent contractors and decided not to pay the taxes, what would've happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.030" offset="11651532">Well of course a number of things would happen, but experience in the fishing industry showed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.359" offset="11672848">That the tax collector would file liens on the boats, attach whatever property at hand, including bank accounts and literally tie up your business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.210" offset="11712240">Now this happened in Enochs versus Williams Packing Company which came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.093" offset="11731780">It will be remembered that William's was a shrimp boat fleet operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.712" offset="11746200">He had made a decision that these men were independent contractors and had for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.641" offset="11761977">He didn't pay any tax and he didn't file a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.705" offset="11778173">An assessment of about $50,000.00 was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.114" offset="11799803">A -- his boats were tied up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.424" offset="11809102">The -- William's went to the District Court and obtained an injunction against the collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.398" offset="11828955">The Circuit Court affirmed with one dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.563" offset="11841599">It came here on jurisdictional issue of enjoining the collection of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.805" offset="11862601">The injunction was dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.074" offset="11867617">It was remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.032" offset="11883499">Thereafter, Williams paid a small amount of that tax and not because he believed that these people were employees and he filed another suit in the District Court and the Government counterclaimed for $50,000.00 for whatever the assessment was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.625" offset="11941909">William has prevailed and the Government's counterclaim was dismissed and that's in William's Packing versus U.S, the number is 2631 in the Southern District of Mississippi, the judgment was filed February 18, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.520" offset="11997497">Now, the Government made the same contention without success in another employment tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.671" offset="12018082">This involved the employment status of certain mechanics and their helpers, they call them applicators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.699" offset="12042219">The Court's treatment I think is worthy of consideration here since we didn't get an opportunity to brief it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.098" offset="12063744">Please permit me to read just a short paragraph from the case of Rayhill versus United States, 364 F.2nd 356 and this will complete my analysis at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.964" offset="12115257">In that case it said, “Nor in the circumstances of this case can an intent to create an employer-employee relationship be inferred from the fact without more that plaintiff withheld from, and paid the appropriate federal taxes on the earnings of the applicators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.761" offset="12182444">Failure to have made such withholdings and payments might have subjected it to assessments and penalties and possible criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.665" offset="12214000">Then, too, the plaintiff could not have challenged a deficiency in the tax court or had a reasonable prospect of obtaining an injunction to restrain enforcement of the tax,” citing Enochs versus Williams Packing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.110" offset="12263842">“One need not resort to martyrdom to obtain judicial determination of the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.635" offset="12285889">To suggest that plaintiff should not have paid the tax if it believed that the applicators were not common-law employees would be to approve snares and traps for the unwary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.022" offset="12331447">In addition, the payment of the tax was a jurisdictional prerequisite to the filing of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.619" offset="12353808">It would be an unusual law which first required the payment of a tax as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the filing of a suit for its refund and then permit its payment to be a ground for a defense against the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.754" offset="12414412">Before going into that maritime oriented employee point, I'd like to mention this that the petition for the writ here indicated that the decision below will disrupt even handed administration of the Social Security Act and would cause certain fishermen to lose Social Security benefits and we take exception to that in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.391" offset="12504900">The petitioner did not pursue this point when he had its brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.157" offset="12527992">We think the contention raised important issues respecting the social and remedial aspects of the Social Security Act and should be -- and should not be ignored simply because it was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.204" offset="12576162">Now, the decision below does not deprive the fishermen of their Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.637" offset="12605942">In holding that these fishermen were not employees, it follows as a consequence that they were self employed or independent contractors which Congress put into one group.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.924" offset="12747107">We don't have the situation of a captain having paid the tax on their earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.307" offset="12768632">However, going into that point, in the case of U.S. v. Joe Graso and Sons which is in our brief, this question came up sometime ago when the Government tried to file a third party complaint to make the captains liable for the taxes if the owners were not liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.126" offset="12863927">It was held that it was being an independent action the third party complaint was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.667" offset="12886079">It didn't get to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.689" offset="12890154">Also the court in Graso did say that it is quite possible that the relationship between the captains and the fishermen would not be that of employer-employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.223" offset="12940309">You'd have to test it against the statute first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.735" offset="12950340">As a matter of fact, the Department of Justice in an anti-trust case was quite successful in prosecuting members of the fish industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.055" offset="12987643">In Local 36, International Fishermen and Allied Workers versus U.S. 177 F.2nd 320 which is cited Graso and there it was found that the captains and the crewmen were joint venturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.697" offset="13062144">In that case, the Government needed proof of joint venture rather an employer-employee for the success of their prosecution and even though Social Security taxes were paid in that case and the defendants tried everything to prove an employment relationship, the Court held it as a joint venture between the captain and the fishermen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.308" offset="13160573">I'd like to say that these fishermen are not loosing Social Insurance benefits because by virtue of the 1950 amendments of the Social Security Act, benefits were extended to the self employed for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.945" offset="13219192">Prior to these amendments, it's true they may have been deprived of such benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.191" offset="13240090">So the distinction today between the common law employee and the self employed person or the entrepreneur with respect to Social Insurance at least is no longer meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.612" offset="13285857">It's now only a tax matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.402" offset="13292962">The question is who pays the tax and what is the difference?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Lyman</label>
            <text syncTime="3321.409" offset="13388988">Except the rate is a little different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.948" offset="13395153">I think that the self employed would pay something less than three-fourths of the total that would be paid between an employer and employee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3333.436" stopTime="3336.015">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3333.436" offset="13437158">But basically the same benefit -- ultimate benefits?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_j_lyman" startTime="3336.015" stopTime="3686.379">
            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Lyman</label>
            <text syncTime="3336.015" offset="13447398">The ultimate benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.672" offset="13450010">As a matter of fact Your Honor, there is one benefit I think the self employed man gets that the common law employee does not and he can participate in the I think it's the 1964 Self Employment Pension Act where lawyers are doing it and I'm sure that there are some fish captains that do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.503" offset="13537364">Now, this equality between the two categories is demonstrated because the earnings credits of these people which determine their benefits, they're entitled to the same weight and dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.084" offset="13583757">The Social Security Administration is the same administration that dispenses benefits to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.825" offset="13602670">The same tax collector collects taxes for both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.669" offset="13618030">Now, the petitioner's main thrust here is that the common law test should not be applied, but the rule governing employment relationships under maritime law should be decisive in fixing the respondent's tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.473" offset="13677275">Now, if liability for these taxes is to be so determined, it is a matter for Congress' consideration rather than this Court because it involves federal fiscal policy and prerogatives of legislative definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.682" offset="13754075">I might say that during the pendency of this case, the treasury department attempted to seek an amendment of this Act to call these fishermen statutory employees but Congress took no action on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.329" offset="13808724">The Congress' failure to act if the Court please doesn't tell us anything, but it does -- but the incident does tell us this that the Treasury Department felt that it was vulnerable to adverse decisions by the finder of fact who would apply the common law rule, otherwise, the Treasury Department wouldn't be concerned about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.621" offset="13889808">Now, the petitioner raised and said if a seaman is entitled the maintenance and the cure from the owner, he must be the owner's employee under maritime standards, now I'll accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.321" offset="13932648">But petitioner concludes without more that the seaman mechanically becomes an employee for federal employment tax purposes and hence a common law employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.011" offset="13975385">Now the same individual can be an employee and an independent contractor at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.281" offset="13996492">This Court said in the Labor Board versus Harris, a brief quote, “An individual maybe an independent contractor under the common law control test for purposes of imposing vicarious liability in tort, and maybe an employee for the purpose of other litigations such as unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.187" offset="14072142">” I see my time is about to expire if the Court please but I want to say this that the fishermen in this case whom the Court found did not meet the common law test of master and servant are nevertheless entitled to maintenance and cure by virtue of their marine employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.924" offset="14135045">The Court said in Aguilar versus Standard Oil Company when this particular question came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.489" offset="14157302">It says “Whether by a traditional standards that boat owner is or is not responsible for the injury, yet under maritime law is nevertheless liable as an incident of the marine employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.306" offset="14228564">” We suggest that the main thrust of petitioner's point there is without a merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.020" offset="14255417">I'd like you say in concluding that this decision is not contrary to public policy as Mr. Griswold has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.418" offset="14297004">It will not frustrate the remedial aims of maintenance and cure or other maritime rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.415" offset="14329083">There are many independent contractor relationships which are workable under the Social Security Act and the rulings of the Commission of Internal Revenue will demonstrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.137" offset="14383940">One outstanding that comes to mind is that he considers a self employed person, one who is able to carry on his own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.602" offset="14425736">A poll taker for one who is advertising agencies simply because this poll taker works on a job-to-job basis and yet he is paid by the company, directed by the company nevertheless is a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.359" offset="14476831">The Internal Revenue Service contained an internal revenue bulletin number 1965-30 of July 26, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.646" offset="14521971">It says that those who conduct surveys on certain types of advertising are self employed persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.327" offset="14552691">They're in a business of their own simply because they knock on a door and fill out a form for some company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.416" offset="14577037">Certainly, fishermen who are more skilled and who have a way of life are certainly more in keeping with a trade or business and some poll taker or a real estate salesman for instance, they consider him a self employed person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.726" offset="14646314">A taxicab driver, the Internal Revenues put out many bulletins to taxicab drivers are considered independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.486" offset="14681318">Although they drive the cab of the company, the company has great expenditures and the real man, this company has great expenditures in promoting and keeping an office open, yet the Government finds for tax purposes, he too is a self employed person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.339" offset="14772746">So in conclusion, we ask that the Court consider that the common law test be applied and then if there's any other test to be applied that the Department of Justice address itself to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.380" offset="14840874">Thank you.</text>
