            <text syncTime="12.787" offset="154520">Mr. Hardee, you may proceed whenever you're -- you and you're colleagues are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Hardee</label>
            <text syncTime="20.074" offset="183672">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.948" offset="199137">Edward Moragne Sr. was a longshoreman employed in the Port of Tampa, by Gulf Florida Terminal Corporation, which is a respondent in this case, and was his employer, the stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.293" offset="260577">On December 31, 1964, he was killed when a hedge beam fell, became lose and fell down in the bottom of the hole, where he was discharging cargo, on the SS Palmetto State, a vessel owned by the respondent States Marine Lines, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.025" offset="323480">The vessel was docked up here in Tampa on navigable waters of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.133" offset="347930">His widow, the plaintiff Petsonella Moragne, or herself and her two minor children filed suit in the State Court in four counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.720" offset="390248">Two counts under the States Wrongful Death Act and to claim damages under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.572" offset="409684">One count in negligence to unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.269" offset="420446">And two counts under the States Survivor Act for damages of personal representative and for damages to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.388" offset="448972">The case was removed at the instance of States Marine Lines, Inc. to the Federal District Court in Tampa.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.651" offset="473945">And then upon motions by both respondents, after a third party complaint was filed for indemnity by the ship owner against the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.281" offset="504456">The District Judge struck count two which had to with unseaworthiness and based his decision upon two cases of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the ground against A. Lusi Limited and Emerson against Holloway Concrete Products Company, which held that Florida common law applied and was applicable under the Florida Wrongful Death Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.644" offset="589928">One of these cases were decided in 1953, the other was decided with a vigorous dissent by Judge Brown in 1960, right after this Court came, issued its opinion in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.561" offset="645622">But the District Judge was concerned about the correctness of its ruling and pursuant to the appropriate rule, gave language in his opinion, which allowed us to petition for an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.289" offset="700479">The Court of Appeals granted our interlocutory appeal and then upon the request of the respondent States Marine Lines certified the question involved to the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.586" offset="745723">The Florida Supreme Court held that the warranty of seaworthiness if that is not applicable under the Florida Wrongful Death Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.194" offset="784175">We then requested the Court of Appeals to ignore this opinion on a certified question of the Florida Supreme Court and raise the constitutional questions which are here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.416" offset="837047">Argument was held, briefs were fully made to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.473" offset="853243">The Court of Appeals took a considerable time working with the issue, and then finally in its opinion, said they felt nevertheless bound by the Tungus to accord to the Florida Supreme Court or the Florida Courts, the right to decide what substantive law was applicable to maritime deaths occurring on navigable waters of United States within the territorial limits of Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.591" offset="1521768">And every other state, since Tungus, which is decided this question, some eleven major maritime states have held that the wrongful death statute of those states incorporate admiralty substantive law, it's only in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.860" offset="2318817">I say first of all that Moragne has been decided that the fears expressed by the minority in Tungus have come to fruition.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.667" offset="2358000">And the State of Florida has caused to be applied to maritime deaths in Florida are ruled different from the substantive admiralty rule or a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.632" offset="2401886">So that I think if this Court recedes from the majority reasoning in Tungus and does what the minority suggest, my client is protected in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.722" offset="2446294">This Court asked the parties to brief the question of whether the Harrisburg should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.963" offset="2467192">And I have taken the position that it should be for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.256" offset="2492374">First of all, the Harrisburg of course is a very careful, well reasoned and thought out decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.136" offset="2527901">The problem is that I think the Court in the Harrisburg at that time went a stray on a couple of matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.354" offset="2560815">First of all, the civil law had traditionally been the law applied in admiralty in England and in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.490" offset="2593311">The Court's generally got to the civil law, now this is not to say that Courts might not look to the common law, but at that time Swift against Tyson was in effect, and it was assumed to be a federal uniform, some uniform federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.089" offset="2647751">So that I think Swift against Tyson had some effect on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.014" offset="2659453">And of course, that's been laid to rest in 1936 and 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.160" offset="2680038">But, in looking to the common law, if a Court in admiralty were going to law or applying maritime law would go and look to the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.685" offset="2714102">It seem to me the Court would look in and find a doctrine of the common law, which was a progressive, a good and doctrine that everyone said this is wonderful in it's something that should be adopted by the admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.854" offset="2766764">But in this case, the Court adopted a rule of the common law, which had been abrogated 40 years before by the English Parliament, which had been criticized by everybody that ever said anything about it, which everybody agreed was a terrible rule, the common law, and which everybody agrees, they think it's a terrible rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.652" offset="2833951">So admiralty went out from the civil law theme to engraft into maritime law a rule of the common law, which nobody defends.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.926" offset="2871045">That is that there's no right of action for wrongful death absent the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.857" offset="2890794">And this is where the point here.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.141" offset="2947950">It's a Lord Campbell's type statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.515" offset="2957458">However, it was amended in 1953 to provide for actions ex contractu, as well as actions ex delicto, which brought in the field of implied warranty of food stuffs and product liability and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.721" offset="3022242">So, that is not a technically any longer really a Lord Campbell's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.074" offset="3047633">So that the Harrisburg now has resulted by evolution in the situation that we find ourselves now in Moragne and that is where the State of Florida has effectively abolished the warranty of sea worthiness, which is in deeply engrafted in admiralty and maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.743" offset="3142301">So that a longshoreman, who is healed as distinguished could be an injured on navigable waters of the State of Florida, navigable waters of the United States, within the State of Florida is deprived of this doctrine as warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.815" offset="3198621">And is relegated to common law and negligence, which is very different type now, from the negligence that we know in maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.060" offset="3247626">I think that it's been traditional in admiralty courts, and the Supreme Court in particular has fashioned admiralty remedies and admiralty law where necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.086" offset="3291721">I need only point out a few for instance in this case, the ship owner is seeking indemnity against the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.344" offset="3320769">The indemnity of a ship owner against the stevedore was fashioned by the court in the Ryan case and substantive cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.264" offset="3348459">So, we have indemnity involved in this case, in this very case, which is a court made or court fashioned maritime doctrine, which is unknown in the State of Florida, but it's going to be an issue in this case, and yet the respondents say that the plaintiff, the petitioner here should be relegated the state law, as far as her rights for death are concerned to turn on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.514" offset="3453471">But they turned around and seeked the benefit of the court fashioned, right of indemnity against the stevedore, of course the duty of -- the warranty of sea worthiness is a thing that has been fashioned by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.887" offset="3510941">And the impleader rules had been fashioned by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.290" offset="3524524">I'd like to point out one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.947" offset="3543124">Back in the 1917 to 1924, starting with the Jensen case, the Supreme Court held that a state law, workmen's compensation law, could not validly be applied to maritime injuries or death occurring on state waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.197" offset="3612191">After the Jensen's case the Congress had passed a statute, which can be effective of placing state workmen's compensation laws over these injuries and death.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.818" offset="3654614">And the court – and the Nicker Barker case, said you can't do that, that's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.822" offset="3674676">So then, the Congress came back and passed another statute of the same title exempting members, masters and members of vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.227" offset="3708322">And the Court again said, you cannot constitutionally apply a state statute, workmen's compensation statute, to injuries or death occurring on maritime waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.353" offset="3748760">It seems to me in the Tungus, that this Court has done in maritime deaths, what the court three times said back in 1917 and 1924 that the Congress could not constitutionally do.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.164" offset="3808005">So that I urge this Court, and I'd like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal, if I may, and I urge this Court to receive from the majority reasoning in Tungus and to overrule the Harrisburg.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.820" offset="7614673">They simply state that the result of not covering this area is that state law remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.344" offset="7640795">That's a far cry from saying, we are doing this because we think it's important to preserve state remedies in the three-mile area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.899" offset="7674964">Now, as I've suggested a moment ago, it seems to us the obvious reason why Congress stopped at the three-mile line was because there was no problem within that area then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.481" offset="7721253">There was a problem beyond, nobody quite knew what if any law would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.435" offset="7741106">Obviously, the coastal law, the state couldn't apply beyond three miles, it was beyond the state boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.381" offset="7764929">So what law could apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.628" offset="7773915">One decision of this Court, it suggested that at least where the defendant and plaintiff were of the same stage, you could apply the state law, if it was meant to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.150" offset="7811950">But state laws normally didn't mean to govern accident on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.014" offset="7831385">And there was a vacuum there, which Congress quite reasonably thought it necessary to fill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.205" offset="7856149">As I've also suggested, there were those who wanted to preserve state remedies within the three-mile area, because they were familiar with them or because they viewed them as more generous than the pending federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.158" offset="7923963">Those are hardly reasons for this Court today to hesitate, to erase that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.552" offset="7953533">A distinction which then was not as great as it is now, because then un-seaworthiness remedies were unknown for practical purposes and the remedy beyond three miles was no greater than what state Wrongful Death Act supplied within the three-mile area.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C.G. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="3006.061" offset="12127587">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.642" offset="12141902">I'm representing the respondent stevedore, Gulf Florida Terminal Corporation that was impleaded by the ship owner, by virtue of the Ryan doctrine, which has been referred by Mr. Hardee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.989" offset="12199372">And before proceeding with the two or three points that I'd like to cover, I might mention parenthetically that Mr. Hardee indicated the Ryan doctrine was one newly fashioned in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.193" offset="12264155">And if I remember that decision correctly, and it's not correctly involved in the appeal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.732" offset="12286307">It was merely an extension of implied contractual warranties, which had been recognized as early as Buick versus Pearson and then restated in the restatement contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.295" offset="12320580">And those with authorities were lined on by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.284" offset="12332492">In any event, at this stage of litigation, at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.613" offset="12349837">The interest of the ship owner and the stevedore are alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.050" offset="12367600">And we join therefore, in urging that the Court of Appeals below and insofar as they incorporated the opinion, the Florida Supreme Court, that Court also be affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.788" offset="12418487">I'd like to make just three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.550" offset="12433533">The first one is one that was I think had demonstrated by the Florida Supreme Court in its opinion, as one of the factors, practical factors that it had in mind in trying to arrive at a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.154" offset="12491943">And that was the posture of the case as it presented itself to that point, in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.818" offset="12522663">The Court recognized that Mrs. Moragne, the petitioner here, had available one remedy irrespective of fault already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.038" offset="12555473">They took note of the fact, that she had available two of the statutory remedies, under the federal Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.707" offset="12590164">They also recognized that she would have an addition to that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.273" offset="12608449">The right to pursue a course of action based on negligence on the Florida wrongful death statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.113" offset="12631855">So that the sole issue really, the sole practical issue was whether or not she could also, in addition to those two pursue a cause of action based on the warranty of seaworthiness, which stated somewhat differently, and is already alluded to by Mr. Villareal, simply boils down to the fact as to what burden of proof she will have to maintain in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.704" offset="12722239">At this stage then, the off repeated cry, which is found in the briefs of the petitioner and some of the amicus briefs also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.145" offset="12759960">To the effect that it is cheaper to kill than to injure is at least premature, indeed should negligence be established under the Florida Wrongful Death Statute, it could very possibly be that she would receive as much in compensation, if not more than some other defendants, similarly situated to a land based or lands locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.857" offset="12854836">The second point, which I think was paramount in the mind of the Fifth Circuit, when they considered this problem, was that in Tungus, the decision, the majority opinions is quite clear and was followed by the parties all the way up to the Fifth Circuit, and was followed by the Fifth Circuit in adapting the decision of the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.426" offset="12961102">Because in Tungus, there are at least four points, which become eminently clear and which is stated without any equivocation by Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.114" offset="13011780">The first is that the state wrongful death statutes do not merely give rise to a right to recover, but further establish what type of conduct is actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.855" offset="13058800">The second proposition, which is stated with equal clarity is that when admiralty courts are called upon to apply or enforce rights, which are "routed" in state law, then they the admiralty courts must do so consonant with state substantive law, they may not, as the decision went on to say pick or choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.316" offset="13152632">The third principle, which is eminently clear in that opinion, is that Congress in enacting the Death on the High Seas Act, intended to preserve intact state sovereignty over maritime deaths within territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.461" offset="13217207">And the fourth proposition, which is stated in the opinion, is that the uniformity argument, is in opposite in rights -- in the case of rights given to recover in death cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.106" offset="13259839">And as already been suggested this was noted as early as the Jensen case, both in the majority opinion and in Mr. Justice Holmes' opinion where he spoke of the specter of a lack of uniformity in referring to this particular area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.935" offset="13331101">This latter proposition in Tungus, we submit is probably or undoubtedly the key question that is, why is it that in this particular area of the law, with respect to the death cases, there should be a departure from so-called uniformity and there has been consistently in this Court and other Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.648" offset="13429948">We submit that the Harrisburg, and Jensen, and Tungus, and also in particularly actually language of Mr. Justice Harlan's dissent in Hess suggest several reasons why in this particular area of the law, uniformity has not been a compelling factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.719" offset="13510196">In the first place, actions for wrongful death being preaches of statute or inherently non-uniform, in every jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.817" offset="13546663">And it's not very helpful here to point out that the archade in inhumane treatment, given this matter on the common law is no longer fashionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.394" offset="13588982">This of course is true but the simple fact is that every jurisdiction has its own statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.983" offset="13615313">Indeed, Congress has two separate statutory schemes, and they are themselves dissimilar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.787" offset="13638510">So, perhaps uniformity or lack of uniformity for this reason is a built in situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.435" offset="13669125">Secondly, as it has been pointed out, the wrongful death statutes involved matters which are peculiarly of local concern, and in again from the Hess opinion, site such examples as pauperism and dissent and distribution, in other matters which are really almost within the state's police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.028" offset="13743522">The third reason, why this area has perhaps been carved out of the uniformity situation, while the wrongful death statute maybe of grave concern in individual cases to certain individuals, they do not from a maritime concept involve matters of navigation and commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.691" offset="13830144">In reading the cases, one notices, particularly in Hess and also in Jensen, that the concept of uniformity in admiralty was developed more as a maritime commercial aid, that is to give the ship owner some degree of certainty, as to what his obligations would be commercial and from the standpoint of commercial obligations, and navigational requirements and regulations, from state to state and nation to nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.145" offset="13951979">It was to give him some certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.127" offset="13963891">Indeed, I think this is perhaps an explanation of the Hess case, where the Oregon statute in question, increased or imposed an added burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.847" offset="14002761">It was this type of uniformity from the standpoint of the ship owner's operation that the concept we suggest or we submit was evolved to meet.</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.321" offset="14108609">It's the brief on behalf of Gulf Florida Terminal Company respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.878" offset="14130866">And there's a name of George W. Ericksen and James B. McDonough Jr. Finally, it has been suggested that the wrongful death statutes are not efforts to delineate or create standards of conduct or care but rather designed merely to give a remedy, where an existing standard is breached and since this is resulting in death of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.986" offset="14275271">The final point that I would like to make in this connection is that the statutory history of the Florida Wrongful Death Statute was of some concern to the Florida Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.830" offset="14338696">It was discussed in some length in the opinion and this is consonant with the attitude, which has been demonstrated by this Court and its concern with the history of the Death on the High Seas Act and the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.748" offset="14394389">We note for instance that the Death on the High Seas Act was passed 34 years after the Harrisburg had established that there was no action for wrongful death in maritime law or fatality within the territorial waters of the state and demonstrated as it has been noted by this Court, an intent to preserve state sovereignty in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.265" offset="14472443">There have been no Amendments to the Death on the High Seas Act, until the recently proposed Magnuson (ph) bill, which is Senate Bill 3143 and is mentioned in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.536" offset="14521553">Despite the decision in Tungus in 1959, and Hess in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.931" offset="14547048">Similarly, with respect to the Jones Act, there has been no amendment to cover death of a seaman in state territorial waters based on unseaworthiness as a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.350" offset="14588740">Despite the decision in Lindgren, which was in 1930 and the reaffirmation of that principle in Gillespie in 1964, so this Court has taken note of Congress's inactivity or of acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.756" offset="14654360">The Florida Supreme Court was faced with a very similar situation, because in Graham v. Lusi, which was decided in 1953, it was held that the Florida statute did not contemplate a cause of action based on unseaworthiness, and that was reaffirmed in Emerson v. Holloway in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.414" offset="14733040">So there were 15 years without corrective action by the Florida legislature, and yet as noted by the Florida Supreme Court, the Florida legislature has been sensitive to the statute, because it amend the statute to cover cause of action based on a warranty on food stuffs, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.265" offset="14804407">And they did that very promptly, because a decision which held that was not covered under statute, it was 1952 in the very next session adopted an amendment, the Florida wrongful death statute, but they have not chosen to do so, despite the opinions of the Fifth Circuit, which have been in existence for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.297" offset="14880580">We attach some significance to the sensitivity which has been demonstrated by this Court, as well as the sensitivities demonstrated by Florida Supreme Court to existing statute and existing statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.585" offset="14929690">We feel in highlights of the fact that if a change, in this particular area of the laws to come, it must come to the legislature, and not to the court.</text>
