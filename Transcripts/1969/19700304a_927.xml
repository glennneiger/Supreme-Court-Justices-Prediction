            <text syncTime="261.654" offset="1151018">The reason for the alibi ruling Your Honors is in a quest for the search for truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.104" offset="1172856">In arguendo Your Honors, I concede all of this absolutely for the sake of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.563" offset="1194695">I would also concede Your Honors if they would ask and without being utterly facetious about it that the alibi rule would stop pollution and stop the war and anything else because Your Honors, I think not subject to reasonable question that whatever comes within the scope of the Fifth Amendment it is not subject to competing state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.588" offset="1290721">The state has not been able to show a solitary case which came within the Fifth Amendment that this Court or any other Court has said or at least that this Court has said, well even though this comes within the Fifth Amendment, the rights of the state in this context are so great that we are not going to bring it out of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.237" offset="1377343">Your Honors, I suggested in my brief or at least cited in my brief an early case Boyd versus United States which had to do with the forfeiture of goods but in the -- and Boyd, this Court quoted from an English trespass case and there the English justice noted that trespass in a single nature is just absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.734" offset="1491341">And I suggest that at least whatever the Fifth Amendment says it's true here, that as the English case said.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.755" offset="1531465">If you're going to have an invasion of this privilege, you have got to go back to the common law principles and find some justification for it and that the silence of the books according to the English justice is authority against the invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.462" offset="1590293">The state is not been able to cite a solitary case of this Court or any case in principle in history which would sanction the use of an alibi witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.587" offset="1654763">The fact I note parenthetically that the alibi witness rule has been proposed twice in the federal rules and rejected but I don't think that that is determinative of all.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.359" offset="1693842">Well, isn't it rather incumbent upon you to show us why this is constitutionally invalid, here is a statute or rule of law that state of Florida would use it quite rightly if it does violate the Fifth Amendment to the constitution, even if we might think it does a good or wise rule if it violates the constitution that violates the constitution, but that as I understand your argument is what you told us so far now isn't it incumbent upon you to tell us why it violates the constitution?</text>

            <text syncTime="437.615" offset="1854861">I agree, I believe I've cited them in my brief but I'm going to discuss now the interpretation of these words in the Fifth Amendment compelled to be a witness against yourself and let's see what these words mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.892" offset="1907942">Let's take the first one which I think is easiest and that is witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.943" offset="1924138">I believe Your Honor is that the state concedes that this alibi and notice rules falls within the term 'witness' and I think they correctly concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.078" offset="1968755">While they cite in their brief some of the physical test cases Schmerber versus California the blood alcohol test, I believe there they might not cite the finger print test cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.197" offset="2021209">All going outside the Fifth Amendment privilege and properly so, is I understand the rationale of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.844" offset="2067811">The Court said the that the Fifth Amendment is related solely to communications and that the physical test not being communications or not being documents or not within Fifth Amendment and I only suggest to the Court that this rationale should not be expanded today because since the state apparently concedes that the notice of alibi rule is within the purview or the category of witness, let's leave it at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.974" offset="2196334">I know that one case that I cited in my brief Albertson versus Subversive Activities Control Board which was the case which this Court said the communist need not register.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.507" offset="2254430">Now, this is the same thing, the mere fact that it's a document, a pleading prior to trial by counsel should not take this Court out of the term or this case rather out of the term of witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.501" offset="11570427">The second issue is raised in our brief is to the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause and the Sixth Amendment entitle a state defendant to a trial of 12-men jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.903" offset="13384056">We suggest that in our brief we put in our brief joined Mr. Justice Harlan's words that there's nothing significant about the number 12 that we've come to get this number based on the anti-establishment clause that its basic reference comes from the bible, 12 disciples to 12 stones to 12 tribes of Israel to 12 gates to Jerusalem, all and there's nothing significant about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.180" offset="13493144">And that six people can provide what Mr. Justice White did say that we put to provide a buffer between Government and the people so that this kind of a pressure is not put on people by overzealous prosecutors or overzealous Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.619" offset="13566913">There have been some statistical study shown in Winchester Massachusetts District Court, the legislature authorized there six-men jury and the report said that it's been found the six member juries render the same kinds of verdicts that 12 member juries render or their render the same kind of lawyers would expect from 12-men juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.562" offset="13646639">It was also found true to be -- this to be true in the state of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.614" offset="13662835">To quote Mr. Justice Holmes in our position, he says that it is revolting that we have no better reason for keeping a rule than that rule was laid down in the time of Henry IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.737" offset="13719364">He says that it's more revolting as the grounds upon which it was laid down long vanished and the rule persist from the blind imitation of the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.113" offset="13756876">We think that the 12 men jury should not be required on the states, additionally we think that the numbers game is not essential to fulfilling the purpose that this Court pronounced in Duncan versus the United -- versus Louisiana and that the sole purpose of the jury is to protect the public and whether that number is six or 12, it is fulfilled and that there is nothing violative of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment when you use six men on a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.501" offset="13890414">We respectfully urge this court on both issues to affirm the District Court of Appeal and to hold particularly that a six men jury does not violate the constitution and the notice of alibi does not violate the Fifth Amendment nor the due process clause of the United State constitution.</text>
