            <text syncTime="42.275" offset="272488">This contempt -- conviction of an attorney is here on appeal from the Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.344" offset="304776">There -- jurisdiction was postponed pending argument on the merits and there are some jurisdictional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.296" offset="344586">Before discussing those, I would like to describe the facts of the conviction itself because of the facts of the conviction also involved some of the jurisdictional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.480" offset="405295">The appellant in this case, Mr. Spencer is an attorney, member of the Louisiana Bar who appeared before a Judge Dixon, a District Court judge in the Louisiana courts representing one, Mr. Hopkins in a hearing in a divorce case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.301" offset="468616">It was an uncontested divorce suit and the purpose of the hearing was, according to Louisiana practice, to confirm default in Mr. Hopkins favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.873" offset="514905">After testimony was taken by -- was given by Mr. Hopkins and witness on his behalf, Judge Dixon denied the divorce because the testimony didn't show abandonment by the spouse but showed only that Mr. Hopkins and Mrs. Hopkins have had argument and that they decided that one of them should leave and Mrs. Hopkins was the one to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.471" offset="621275">The following day after the denial of the divorce, the appellant filed a motion for a new trial on behalf of his client Mr. Hopkins on the ground that the decision by Judge Dixon was erroneous in fact and in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.086" offset="695672">Simultaneously with filing the motion for a new trial, he also filed a motion to recuse Judge Dixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.659" offset="730049">The motion to recuse which he filed was set out in the back of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.078" offset="971734">One of the reasons we don't know whether it's true or false is that the judge who sat on the contempt proceeding itself the year later wouldn't allow any such testimony to be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.798" offset="1022516">Now the record is ambiguous as to whether any such testimony was attempted to be put in by the appellant but it becomes perfectly clear from the statement of Judge Williams himself that he was the judge who sat on the contempt hearing that -- and this is contained in the record of the case and also in the back of the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.734" offset="1126275">He, Judge Williams in opposing Mr. Spencer's application for writs of certiorari to Louisiana Supreme Court said in and I quote, well, I'm sorry I don't quote, but in his application with -- in his opposition to the application which is in the record, Judge Williams said himself that he refused to admit any such evidence concerning the truth of the assertion in the motion to recuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.303" offset="6112632">In Holt there are two -- two lawyers were held in contempt for filing a motion for change of venue in that case in which they charged that the judge there “is now in effect and or in fact acting as police officer, chief prosecution witness, adverse witness for the defense, grand jury, chief prosecutor and judge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.814" offset="6214614">And it also charged that the judge had intimidate and harass Attorney Holt at an earlier hearing on the contempt proceeding and the judge thereupon hearing this motion read in open court said, “I think the plea is contemptuous.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.707" offset="6278248">And the Virginia Supreme Court held that the language in that motion violated the Virginia contempt statute which authorized summary punishment of a person who “misbehaves” in the presence of a court so as to obstruct justice or uses “vile, contemptuous or insulting language” which is language not unlike that contained in the Louisiana contempt statute.</text>
