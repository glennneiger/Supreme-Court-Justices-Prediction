            <label>Mr. Richard W. Mclaren</label>
            <text syncTime="75.818" offset="406653">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.881" offset="422849">May it please the Court, I will direct my argument to case number 28, the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.738" offset="466317">This is a civil case which comes to the Court on direct appeal from the judgment of a three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.743" offset="502366">The District Court denied the Government's request for an injunction and upheld the ICC's approval of the merger of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific Railroads which have been referred to in our briefs as the Northern Lines and their various railroads subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.527" offset="585435">The merger has been stayed by this Court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.363" offset="604871">The issue in this case is whether the ICC correctly applied the public interest test of Section 5 (2) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act when it approved this merger, holding that the savings and service benefits of the merger outweigh the elimination of substantial rail competition between the Northern Lines in the Northern Tier of western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.329" offset="708733">Case number 43, the City of Auburn case is related to our case and that it also raises competitive issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.769" offset="742484">The other two cases, the case number 38, the Brundage case involving the fairness of the merger terms to Northern Pacific Stockholders and number 44, the Livingston case, questioning the Northern Pacific's title to its properties raised on related issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.208" offset="828165">Now, although the record in this case is a very long one, the basic facts are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.728" offset="858258">First, I would like to identify the roads which proposed to merge in terms of the areas they serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.559" offset="889605">The trunk lines of the merger parties are shown in various colors on the fold out map at the end of the Great Northern's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.496" offset="925341">I've taken the liberty of requesting the clerk to distribute to each member of the Court an extra copy of this map and also of a copy of the map which is prepared from exhibit 85 and used by the Government in the District Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.195" offset="992110">The latter shows the applicant roads as they will appear of -- when it -- if merged.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.667" offset="1026069">Looking first at the Great Northern's map, the bigger one, you will see that the Great Northern trunk line toward the top in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.137" offset="1063894">With its affiliates, Great Northern carries on operations over some 80 - 200 miles of road in the Northern Tier States from Minneapolis and Duluth, Duluth from the east to Spokane, Seattle, Portland and other terminals in the Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.786" offset="1138500">Northern Pacific, in green on the map and its affiliates operate over some 6800 miles of road somewhat south of the Great Northern and they serve the same main terminals as the Great Northern in Minnesota and in the Pacific Northwest.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.319" offset="1388648">Shown on the Government's map, the smaller one in red are all of the routes as they will appear of the merged roads both the trunk lines and branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.167" offset="1468061">The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a road that's jointly owned by the Northern Lines is shown -- its main road is shown in brown on the big fold out map.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.010" offset="1519365">Burlington conducts operations over some 8600 miles of road running Northwest from Chicago and Minneapolis and also west from Chicago to serve such points to St. Luis and Kansas City, Omaha, Denver, Billings, Montana and with the connection with Northern Pacific in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.090" offset="1607764">Subsidiaries of the Burlington goes out as far as the Texas Gulf Coast as is shown on the Government map and as the Great Northern map shows, I think the Burlington service tends to be complimentary to rather than competitive with the service of the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.889" offset="1694908">Also involved in the merger is the Spokane, Portland and Seattle railroad about 600 miles of road shown in blue and its main route on the Great Northern map.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.919" offset="1743078">It is also jointly owned by the Northern Lines and its mean line and provides their shortest route from Spokane down to Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.099" offset="1787800">The third line, third rail line providing service across the Northern Tier States is the Milwaukee railroad as shown in black on the Government's map and also on the Great Northern's.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.557" offset="1849553">Now, there's no dispute that the Northern Lines are financially strong firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.937" offset="1883094">They owned vast acreage of valuable land and mineral rights as well as rail and motor carrier assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.951" offset="1919143">There are also regularly profitable although it's fair to say that their profits have fluctuated over the years and do not reflect a large percentage return on their invested capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.153" offset="1972015">As merged, the Northern Lines and the Burlington would constitute one of the largest rail systems in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.692" offset="2006183">The merged company would have some 27,000 miles of track in 16 states, total assets around $3 billion, annual rail revenues, $823 million and net income in the neighborhood of $131 million a year.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard W. Mclaren</label>
            <text syncTime="500.655" offset="2105971">I believe Mr. Justice Harlan that in trackage it is bigger, in terms of revenue, it is not as big.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.777" offset="2150484">I'm not positive of those figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.416" offset="2177024">As the maps tend to indicate, the Northern Lines are head to head competitors for traffic across the Northern Tier States.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.853" offset="2218820">Each is the main competitor of the other and the Milwaukee is a very weak third.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.974" offset="2243271">The nature and the extent of this competition, rail competition, and the intermodal competition in this area is covered by the findings in the ICC reports as I'll describe in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.187" offset="2304084">To summarize the proceedings in the Interstate Commerce Commission, there are two main reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.816" offset="2334595">The first, disapproved the merger on grounds that it would have a drastically adverse effect on competition as well as the adverse effects on employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.684" offset="2382137">The second report on reconsideration reversed and it approved the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.039" offset="2407528">I should say that the findings of fact in the first report are of significance since they are largely found again in the second report which is based on substantially the same record.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.606" offset="2461759">There are few exceptions, as I will point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.353" offset="2476805">I also think that the rational of the first report is important since it's our contention that it applied the correct legal standard whereas the second report did not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard W. Mclaren</label>
            <text syncTime="645.075" offset="2683695">I believe that the figures that Your Honor is recalling has to do with approximately 6% that points where the Northern Lines are the only rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.591" offset="2745762">I believe that there is another figure of some on 37% or 38% where they compete for revenues and there all -- is also some other competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.918" offset="2806993">And the broad figure that we use and that I will get into in some further detail a little bit later is that the Northern Lines directly compete for around 43% of their revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.182" offset="2864149">They -- and there's an additional overhead portion of their revenue, a 12%.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.642" offset="2885987">So, we're contending that they are competitors for about 55% of their revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.654" offset="2910020">There are some other figures as to the percentage of the market they have which I will get to.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.598" offset="2933739">It runs to 60%, 70% and 80% in different areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.818" offset="2958608">To review just briefly, the proceedings in the Interstate Commerce Commission; they began in 1961 when the applicant's petition for authority to merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.426" offset="3013047">Public hearings were held in 1961 and 1962 in which the Justice Department participated and in 1964, the Examiner issued a report recommending the merger with certain conditions be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.948" offset="3071143">The matter was then briefed and argued before the ICC and in 1966, ICC issued its first report disapproving the merger even if conditioned as demanded by various interveners, including various other affected railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.042" offset="3139584">Now, in the course to this first report, the Commission analyzed the evidence of the estimated savings to the applicants in merger which it estimated around twenty two and a half million dollars a year after 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.406" offset="3201024">The report detailed and analyzed the various efficiencies, principally the combining of yards and other facilities and the reduction of work forces and the report listed also the advantage to shippers, principally more direct routing and faster schedules all of which the merger promised.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.148" offset="3283989">On the other hand, the report noted that applicants could coordinate certain facilities and realize very substantial savings without merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.262" offset="3324426">It pointed out that the applicants are “large, strong and prosperous railroads and growing strong.”</text>
            <text syncTime="815.196" offset="3364133">It also found that their long-term train was favorable as against motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.022" offset="3387434">It found that ton miles of freight had increase substantially during the 1960 through 1964 period and it found that the railroads had what it called a decided competitive advantage in many long haul of movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.339" offset="3460681">Now, in approaching the public interest test laid down by Section 5 (2) of the Commerce Act, the Commission saw its task as one of determining whether the adverse effects of the merger upon competition and on carry employees were outweighed by cost savings to applicants and the improved service to shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.489" offset="3545318">It saw the public interest scale as being imbalanced, tipped neither for nor against the merger under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.974" offset="3579277">Analyzing the competitive effects of the merger, the Commission focused on the Northern Tier States as being the area in which a low cost rail transportation was as it said of primary importance to long-haul, raw material shippers in the area where rail competition would be most adversely affected by the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.902" offset="3671019">The report also found that whereas animal, mineral, agricultural and forest products account for around 60% of Northern Lines' revenues, this kind of traffic was generally not attractive to motor carriers and was not highly susceptible to diversion to motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.535" offset="3753462">In fact, it found that intermodal competition is not as strong in the Northern states here as in other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.216" offset="3796198">The report also found that the Northern Lines were in direct and substantial competition with one another and then when this was eliminated, the merged road would have a dominant position in the Northern Tier States.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.789" offset="3854503">For example, it found that together the Northern Lines would handle 61% of the carload traffic moving westbound in the Northern Tier and 83% eastbound.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.128" offset="3903927">As to West Coast traffic from Washington to California, it would have 73.5% moving north and south through the Seista and Beaver Gateways and that it would move 67% of ton 10 miles of rail freight in the Northern Tier States; 45% Minnesota, 81% North Dakota, 82% in Montana and 77% in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.917" offset="4015000">After the merger, the first report found that Northern Lines would as the report said, reign supreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.671" offset="4046033">They would overshadow all their rail competitors within this region and from this region to points beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.301" offset="4080619">Measuring the competition that would be eliminated, ICC found that the Northern Lines were in direct competition as I mentioned at points accounting for 43% of their revenues and further that they competed for overhead traffic accounting for another 12%, thus the merger would eliminate the competition between them for 55% of their total revenues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2222.893" offset="8994983">It does appear to us that they in effect did accept the idea that there's a presumption in favor of mergers that are brought up by the private parties in the second report whereas they gave competition, a certain value and weight in the first report that they didn't in the second report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.624" offset="9081919">But there, the difficulty as they pointed out in the first report, Mr. Justice Stewart is that you have the difficult task of weighing an intangible value of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.686" offset="9130088">On the one hand against the savings from merger the tangible values that you can say, well, it's $25 million a year and how do you say whether competition is worth $25 million a year?</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.835" offset="9362683">I think that two or three of the Court's more recent cases have cast some additional light on this in the sense that the Court has treated competition as the basic policy and it has treated the power of the administrative agency to grant immunity from that as carrying a rather important determination that is to be made by the administrative agency and --</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.955" offset="9931212">But before the record was closed because the Milwaukee had put through some faster trains, they'd cut more than 12 hours off already.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.716" offset="9962245">They took some lighter weight equipment and they were more careful in their scheduling and there is nothing to prevent them, if Your Honor please, to work out these better routings without merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.048" offset="10015535">They don't have to merge these railroads in order to get direct routings and that's what the minority, what the dissent in the first report was pointing to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.900" offset="10050957">They have sat here fat and happy they've been entirely unwilling to take advantage of the possibilities that they were for more direct routings to try and meet the truck competition that the other side talks about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.613" offset="10113860">They could've done that, they don't have to merge to do it, and they could cut very, very substantial time of the run from the west down into the markets where they need to market these products from the raw materials country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.855" offset="10214797">Referring once again to the Svenska case, I wanted to point out that the -- the -- this came up on the Maritime Commissions Power which is comparable to the Commission's power to grant immunity to an anticompetitive arrangement and there I think it was an exclusive dealing arrangement and referring to the question of the National Economic Policy, the Court pointed out that another lies illegal arrangement and as the Court said, “alone, will normally constitute substantial evidence that the agreement is contrary to the public interest unless other evidence fairly detracts from the weight of this factor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.315" offset="10404655">Now, we contend that the Maritime Commission Rule that was discussed and upheld in Svenska precisely describes the standard which governs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.219" offset="10448227">FMC's rule put the burden on the proponent of the anticompetitive agreement just as we would put the burden on the applicants to merge, to demonstrate that it was required by a serious transportation need, necessary to secure important public benefits for -- in furtherance of a valid regulatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.579" offset="10553657">And the Court not only upheld the Svenska -- FMC rule, but it stated that the standard was “in full accord with the kind of accommodation between anti-trust and regulatory objectives approved by this Court in the Seaboard Airline in Minneapolis St. Paul rail merger decisions.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.603" offset="12541785">Well there were changes in the facts between the first and second report, aren't there -- weren't there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.393" offset="12560906">In other words although you disagree that with the suggestion in the question of Mr. Justice Brennan that the Commission in fact applied the same basic standard in each case but came out differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.900" offset="12619003">At least I would suppose if there were changes in the facts as I understand there were that it would been -- would've been quite possible for the same Commission to apply the same standards and come out differently and the changes to which I refer are first of all the petition by these applicants which led to the second report accepting every single one of the conditions affecting the Milwaukee, every single one of the conditions affecting the Chicago and Northwestern agreeing fully to enter into a collective bargaining agreements with the representatives of their employee to take care attrition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.374" offset="12780857">And finally, pointing out that the profits that would ensue upon this merger, the -- I beg your pardon, the savings that would ensue upon this merger were substantially greater than at first been assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.151" offset="12827982">Now, if I'm correct that these or any of these changes in facts were evident or present at the time of the second report, it would be quite conceivable that you could apply the same standards and come out with a different result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.064" offset="12911679">As far as the conditions are concerned, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think in the first report, they assumed the conditions as to the Milwaukee at least which are I think preeminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.627" offset="12961834">Now, I'm not sure that they assumed the attrition agreements in favor of employees and it's true that in the first report they pointed out that it was both the anti-competitive effect and the adverse effect on employees, it was bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.728" offset="13022333">But, the main conditions for the Milwaukee, I think had been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.696" offset="13042186">As far as the savings are concerned, the new evidence that came in, there were just four days of the hearing on reconsideration, three of them with proponents and one for rebuttal and the savings there, the additional evidence had largely to do with simply an adjustment factor applying a percentage to previously estimated savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.785" offset="13142497">So, I don't think that was a matter of new evidence particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.842" offset="13162768">As a matter of fact, the anti-trust division petitioned that the matter be reopened both to find out who many more changes there had been already put into a fact like this faster train business and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.579" offset="13225671">And also what savings had been achieved and could be achieved without merger and this was denied by the Examiner and upheld by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.414" offset="13509047">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.114" offset="13527855">Our appeal is from the three-judge District Court in the District of Columbia unanimously affirming -- unanimously dismissing our complaint in an action seeking to annul, set aside and restrain the enforcement of two Interstate Commerce Commission orders which had approved the merger terms and it also affirmed the Commission orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.273" offset="13644466">My remarks will be directed as to the justice and propriety of the Stock Exchange ratios and only that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.955" offset="13675186">Now there are certain basic practices that I think the Court must keep in mind in connection with our appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.453" offset="13701204">One is that isn't just another railroad case coming down or up the legal tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.604" offset="13733804">Northern Pacific has been mentioned here, has a great many, very vast and valuable land interests containing oil and gas, timber, coal, iron, ore and many other minerals yet un-found in an area that is about as large as Massachusetts and Connecticut combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.826" offset="13830666">Now the basic character of Northern Pacific changed after 1951 when substantial oil was found in the Williston Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.790" offset="13866506">The state recognized this when they eliminated Northern Pacific stock from the Dow Jones rail average.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.489" offset="13897331">The 1960, to give you an idea of what it did to the earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.315" offset="13916662">In 1960, a few take their earnings of Northern Pacific and eliminate the Burlington dividend which was substantial of the remaining earnings, 50% of that came from natural resources and 50% from transportation properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.401" offset="13984998">So, that what we are talking about here is a very, very vital matter in determining stock exchange ratios.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.285" offset="14016554">Now, another thing that you must keep in mind on this appeal, raised a new problem for the Interstate Commerce Commission as to the valuation of such properties quite disparate from railroad properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.632" offset="14077889">The District Court is faced with this new problem and we suggest that the Schwabacher case, no other railroad case has this Court been faced with this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.759" offset="14134418">Now, when I speak in this case of the parties, I will refer Northern Pacific as NP and the Great Northern as GN.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.598" offset="14185723">The one -- I think first thing we should do is simply state what are the proposed merger terms to have it as background?</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.263" offset="14216443">Under the terms in Northern Pacific stockholders will get one share of the new company's common stock for each share that they have, same for Great Northern, but in addition, the Great Northern's going to get a half of share of a $10 preferred stock which must be redeemed commencing five years after the consummation of the merger, over the next 25 years, 4% a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.107" offset="14323754">But it has a call provision in it that anytime after five years of consummation of the merger that it maybe redeemed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.203" offset="14356146">But the thing to note is that surely Northern Pacific's stockholders could not even achieve equality with this Great Northern until 30 years after consummation when right today the earnings of Northern Pacific are greater that Great Northern's.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.637" offset="14425945">Is the redemption to be at par, $10 a share?</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.094" offset="14439737">Yes, it might be $110, I'm not sure of that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.617" offset="14469831">Now, I come to the first point and that is this, that the Commission in the District Court have committed error in misinterpreting what the standards are as to the application Section 2, subdivision 2 of Section 5, Interstate Commerce Act that perhaps the best thing to do is quote, first, what the Commission said and then what the District Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.197" offset="14580172">Let me quote from the Commission, this is in 297 of your appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.643" offset="14601906">“The issue here is whether the exchange ratios are just and reasonable and limited thereto, we find the record both adequate and affirmative in that they either necessary, no in that they meet the necessary and required tests, one, that there are the result of arms length bargaining and two, that they fairly reflect the contributions of each group of stockholders of the combined system.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.139" offset="14719979">That was the basis of the commission decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.857" offset="14726771">Now, what the District Courts say, “On the basis of the record upon which the Commission relied, we have no reason to rule other than that the ratio which was established with the approval of the companies and of a large majority of their stockholders is just and reasonable."</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.184" offset="14808064">Now, let's take a look at Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.570" offset="14821648">There are really three steps involved in the achieving a railroad mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.044" offset="14839515">The first is the parties have to agree on something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.424" offset="14853099">Second is, that the Commission then takes action supposedly independent in which they either approve these terms or they modify them under Section 5 (2) to achieve what the test is of justice and reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.380" offset="14916942">And the third thing that happens, after the Commission is all through of the case then you must have assent of the stockholders by an appropriate vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.733" offset="14954350">Now, the Court's duty is one, that's quite independent of any agreement of the parties or stockholder approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.381" offset="15000848">Parties got to agree before otherwise there is no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.367" offset="15016835">And the stockholder approval is only in there having to do with relevant as to the enforcement of whatever the Commission has found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.092" offset="15055705">So that the error here is in relying for the decision on irrelevant things as to par -- as to agreement of the parties in the first place and the subsequent approval by the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.312" offset="15120593">This we claim is legal error.Now there's no mention of Section 5 of arms length bargaining and et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.194" offset="15148178">The only reference in Section 5 et al is in subdivision 11 where it says that is a precondition consummation, you've got to get the assent of the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.024" offset="15187466">In Re, North American Power and Light, the Circuit Court in the third district held in a public utility holding case that the presence of arm's length bargaining is not a decisive criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.574" offset="15249638">Now, although we claim that Section 5 doesn't make arm's length bargaining and stockholders' vote and necessary required test under 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.724" offset="15290284">I think it might be helpful to the Court for whatever weight or relevant you think these two factors have and to just examine what the record says about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.207" offset="15332185">First, let's take the arm's length bargaining business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.696" offset="15350157">And why I say we impute no fraud or chicanery to the negotiator of these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.072" offset="15375653">These are responsible people, we recognize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.955" offset="15391222">But, the common interest switch they have had in joint ownership of the Burlington running back to 91, a wholly owned ownership of the SP&amp;S which the precedence alternated as precedence of the SP&amp;S and the joint operations of the Montour Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.688" offset="15462170">You just couldn't have these kind of arm's length bargaining which I think any court would consider to be arm's length bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.181" offset="15500100">But more disturbing importance is the conflict of interests that shows up on the part of two members of the five members on the Northern Pacific consolidation committee which was the negotiating committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.576" offset="15557674">One of them, this is in exhibit 26 on page 21, one of them owned only 400 shares in Northern Pacific, but he was a vice-president, director of a Hill Foundation, what did that hold?</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.712" offset="15622248">Not a single share of Northern Pacific and 18 -- more than 18,000 shares of Great Northern.</text>

            <text syncTime="3910.830" offset="15746696">Another member of the Committee had -- was the president of two mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.932" offset="15775117">One of them had to be large amount of Northern Pacific stock only, but the second one had only 13,000 Northern Pacific stock and over 46000 of Great Northern stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.337" offset="15840737">Now, this -- the general legal definition of what constitutes market value and this Court in Schwabacher posited the fact that the true criterion was the present intrinsic or market value of the contributions being made by the various groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.416" offset="15909073">Having that in mind, the general legal definition is what would knowledgeable of willing traders who wanted to make a deal in a trade acting under no compulsion at all, what would -- what figure would they arrive?</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.294" offset="15984515">Now, let's take a look at that, what's in this record?</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.567" offset="16001651">The Great Northern had testified on its direct, this wasn't crossed, that the achievement of railroad mergers, of the railroad properties was as he said, “Done under extreme compulsion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.894" offset="16082944">The President of the Northern Pacific confirmed this on his direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.426" offset="16101125">He characterized and used a very accurate adjective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.384" offset="16120874">He said that this matter of achieving railroad consolidations was “the overriding consideration” in a mortgage act -- in this merger application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.686" offset="16186075">Now, how soft the bargaining was in this matter is shown by when they got to discussing the industrial properties both -- which both railroads had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.363" offset="16228812">Northern Pacific's had been evaluated at $32,700,000, so they weren't talking about peanuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.275" offset="16256502">The financial adviser for Northern Pacific was willing to take merely the assurance without any appraisals of the GN had that they had properties of very substantial character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.941" offset="16315120">But the earnings from -- their relative earnings from this particular category of assets in 1960 when this merger terms were agreed on, Northern Pacific's were twice that of Great Northern's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.710" offset="16374262">So, I say this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4268.179" offset="17176116">Now the unique problem on this case is determining merger terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.973" offset="17199313">How do you value, weigh and relate the contributions of the two parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.298" offset="17224600">One has only railroad properties and the other has railroad properties plus these vast natural resources, some of which are not currently producing income, but are expected to in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.223" offset="17272247">Now, there's no issue in this question about the valuation of railroad properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.519" offset="17289488">Committee agrees that it's proper to take a capitalization of earnings because they are not readily marketable and they are worth only what they can earn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.145" offset="17331911">Committee was satisfied with the 60-40 GNNP relationship on the railroad properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.379" offset="17360854">Mr. Williams, the committee's expert came up with the price earnings ratio of 15 times earnings in 1960 when the terms were agreed upon as an appropriate one and that hasn't been questioned anywhere in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.027" offset="17411532">The real issue is how are you going to value these natural resources?</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.991" offset="17431385">The applicant's position on that on the record was that it's difficult, if not impossible, to value respective stocks except on the basis of capitalization of earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.334" offset="17480704">That they made an attempt to value stocks by a separate valuation and they found it impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.492" offset="17505364">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.460" offset="17509230">Because they couldn't agree on the stock ratio because of difficulty of valuing these properties on account of market conditions and the uncertainty of their future potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.341" offset="17548727">So they made what they called no definitive valuation of properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.106" offset="17579760">They say it in the last analysis, it just has to be a question of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.592" offset="17601703">Now, the committee's position was and is that you arrive at a proper, the intrinsic stock market value of these two stocks which is what Schwabacher mandated that it's more appropriate to take a market value of them rather than measure them on the basis of capitalization of earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.465" offset="17709223">But if you do take current earnings and capitalize it, that in the market place, knowledgeable traders wind up with a very high price earnings ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.652" offset="17758020">Northern Pacific's financial adviser agrees with the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.965" offset="17775261">Let me read to you from Exhibit 32, page 3 which is Morgan Stanley's report on the non-railroad properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.159" offset="17807966">Here's what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.612" offset="17817788">“In essence, however, a sale of interest in the properties would take place to create Northern stockholders and on this basis, Northern Pacific stockholders should realize sale value rather than value based on capitalization of earnings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.003" offset="17895424">And the committee chairman frankly testified on his direct testimony that you can't make any exact appraisal in dollars of these properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.732" offset="17938265">We claim however though, although it's not easy to value, some approximate valuation is not only possible, but is necessary if you're going to sustain merger terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.755" offset="17986435">Now, what was the applicant's evidence in the record to support this finding?</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.756" offset="18014438">It's based largely on past performances to earnings, dividends, stock market quotations and pro forma, dividend comparisons and on an erroneous and gloomy prediction that there was nothing reasonably foreseeable to indicate that Northern Pacific's future earnings prospects were better than Great Northern's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.177" offset="18104090">And I'm sure the Court is aware, my former statement, in the last two years, our earnings have exceeded Great Northern's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.362" offset="18132825">Now, the GN's financial adviser, first Boston's witness testified, “the study of past performance is only important insofar as it measures or predicts future prospects.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.530" offset="18189458">This was his direct testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.064" offset="18199594">With that, the committee agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.672" offset="18214013">Now, the applicant's case as to the future prospects and value of these resources is based on evidence that we regard as of little prohibitive value and that's the test of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.726" offset="18274304">They offered no market appraisals for these properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.191" offset="18292172">They put on the stand, no timber, oil or other geologist or expert on these matters that we could cross-examine, there's none of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.205" offset="18340237">Both financial advisers on cross-examination were extremely vague as to past prices of timber and oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.666" offset="18373987">In other words, a direct case of the applicants was largely a long dreary account of their negotiation, how they couldn't agree and all the arguments that they had and it was argument that largely not hard, positive reliable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.926" offset="18451101">Now, contrast the committee's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.209" offset="18460191">We were very serious in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.034" offset="18467506">We were observing the injunction in the Erie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.901" offset="18479000">It said dissenting stockholders should put in positive evidence and should state precise inequities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.376" offset="18504913">We had this constantly in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.955" offset="18515153">So that when we put in our direct case, we had three experts on stock evaluation analysis and an oil geologist that were subjected to searching cross-examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.613" offset="18557785">They testified as to various factors that must be considered when you get to valuing what the traders will -- how they will trade these natural resources and properties in the public market?</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.978" offset="18607313">Mr. Brundage, chairman of the committee testified as to the strong earning power of the natural resources, improved geological and geophysical discovery techniques, the freedom of these properties from obsolescence contrary to railroad properties, the low financial risk, the very high return on capital investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.334" offset="18696756">Our natural resources are yielding each year more than 100% of the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.264" offset="18720475">Whereas the testimony of the applicants on their direct case was that Northern Pacific in 1960 gets -- getting a return of 1.4% on its transportation properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.712" offset="18770213">He spoke of the tax savings running into millions of dollars occasioned by the depletion allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.927" offset="18795081">He spoke of the control elements that you didn't have to develop properties in a hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.176" offset="18812113">You could take your time and you're in control of it and most importantly, he spoke of the intrinsic and the survival values of these properties in an inflationary period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.351" offset="18864776">Now Mr. Williams reported on his studies of comparative companies that had similar properties, then he wound up with a price earnings ratio in his judgment was 50 times earnings and this was never been questioned by any testimony on the part of the applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.146" offset="18940008">He pointed to the TXL, Texaco deal which happen to be consummated about that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.821" offset="18958608">It was a merger like ours, in which the price earnings ratio were 75 times earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.181" offset="18984103">Now, in the Morgan Stanley report which you can see in Exhibit 32, Morgan Stanley, in making their recommendations were terms favorable to Northern Pacific against GN came up with price earnings ratio of 12 on oil and gas, 15 on timber and 15 on other minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.155" offset="19064038">Our oil geologist that was particularly familiar with the Williston Banking, based and he'd cut his eye teeth up in that area, testified as to the favorable prospects of the Williston Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.627" offset="19109909">He predicted a billion tons of oil out of the basin in the next decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.798" offset="19130598">He spoke of a use of the exploration there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.450" offset="19145122">The lack of the exploration of the deeper layers of the ground that pointed out that in the Williston Basin, they'd get a higher rate of discovery than the national rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.778" offset="19190471">And he also said that additional income from the oil would come from secondary recoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.843" offset="19214712">Now, Mr. Story testified as to the economic matters and particularly as to trends of prices of natural resources and their value as a hedge against probable future monetary inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.295" offset="19280541">Now, the important thing for this Court to realize is that this body of specific testimony on the part of the committee was never rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.659" offset="19325994">They had -- the applicants had Morgan Stanley, they had all the oil experts and timber experts on the payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.620" offset="19353893">Thousands of our stockholders' money was paid to hire them, but they didn't go on the stand and say that Mr. William's price earnings ratio was wrong or that Mr. Brundage's testimony as to the various factors that must be considered in the marketplace relating to our natural resources were improper or to how to weigh any factors that pertain to these natural resources, you just draw a blank from the applicants on that aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.458" offset="19457233">So, we say that their testimony is not proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.756" offset="19470399">It isn't reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.209" offset="19476250">No experts, nobody to get at the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.292" offset="19488580">Now, the committee doesn't claim that exchange ratios can be based on exact dollar evaluations, but it does claim that there must be some rational basis in the record for any alleged just ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.095" offset="19543751">If the Commission is to discharge its duty and this Court is to have any meaningful review of the record, and that just that you will search this record and you will not find how they arrived at these decisions except through these bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.229" offset="19612296">Now, the committee also developed calculations to show they were precise in their criticisms of these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.036" offset="19643538">They're all set forth on three different theories and four different points of time, there were 12 different computations and as far as we're concerned, they all with one exception, show that Great Northern should be preferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.276" offset="19704456">It's all in the appendix to our brief and I'm sure and I hope you will study it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.420" offset="19725040">Now, this record contains no discussion by either the Commission or the District Court of this expensive testimony of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.233" offset="19764328">Or was any rational explanation given, set forth anywhere as to how the particular ratios were developed or could be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.342" offset="19804766">We urge that the wholly conclusionary finding of the Commission that these mergers fairly reflect the contributions of the group of stockholders involved is not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence as the administrator procedure requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.799" offset="19878536">Now, I received a five-minute warning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.681" offset="19890134">Our third claim which is that the Commission grossly erred in views of the discretion, denied us due process and outlying a lot of evidence of new evidence that's available now that wasn't then.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.925" offset="19955022">The Pierce case has been cited here as it -- by the District Court as support, but the Pierce case was one in which they were dealing with the impact of war inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.898" offset="20002983">And they said that as to that matter, the Commission was -- that's right within the scope of their particularized expertise and that therefore, there was no need to interrupt them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.936" offset="20051153">We've -- we concede that the general view is that you shouldn't interfere with this, but the adjacent case was right on all fours with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.368" offset="20088874">There they were dealing with the depression, now we're dealing with inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.915" offset="20103084">Even the President in his radio speech last Friday drew this comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.462" offset="20125236">So, we say in conclusion that on no basis and on no theory does the record sustain the finding below and that they made a serious error when they took the wrong test and applied the bargaining process and the stockholder's vote as determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.403" offset="20213008">The Commission simply didn't do its homework on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.143" offset="20227950">You're going to find difficulty, I think, in finding in this record any rational basis to sustain what has been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.348" offset="20264730">So, in conclusion, I would like, respectfully ask this Court that the judgment of the District Court be reversed and that the course be remanded to it with instructions that the matter be remanded that the Commission for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.339" offset="20332753">Now, as was set by this Court in the Penn-Central case, the short delay occasioned by a remand is not too high a price to pay to assure a disposition of this matter that is just to all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.695" offset="20402134">I thank you for earnest consideration.</text>

            <label>Mr. Valentine B. Deale</label>
            <text syncTime="5090.118" offset="20463888">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.717" offset="20482278">The Livingston Anti-Merger Committee raised these two thresholds issues in these consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.840" offset="20518745">The first issue is the issue of a jurisdiction of whether the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction over the proposed merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.539" offset="20565556">The second issue is the issue of whether or not the proposed merger is barred by a statutory law in contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.853" offset="20618742">The Commission's position also embraces the contention that neither the Court below nor the Commission gave adequate consideration to these two primary issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.502" offset="20697422">The issue of jurisdiction is a twin issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.277" offset="20716440">It is an issue of jurisdiction and ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.608" offset="20741831">In terms of the committee's position, the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the proposed merger since one of the central properties in the merger namely the main line right-of-way used and operated by Northern Pacific Railway Company is neither owned by a merger applicant nor owned by a petitioner for inclusion in the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.237" offset="20884355">Putting it another way, it's the committee's position that the ownership of the main line right-of-way continues to vest in the federally, in the federal chartered company, namely Northern Pacific Railroad, an existing federal company controlled to be sure by railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.576" offset="21013713">The merger authorization authority of the Commission has boundaries and it's our position that these boundaries have not been heeded by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.270" offset="21084453">Not just any merger maybe approved by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.858" offset="21110784">The kind of a merger that maybe approved by the Commission is a merger where the properties to be merged are owned by the merger applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.082" offset="21159685">And in the case of the rail merger, the properties may also be owned by a petitioner for inclusion in the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.560" offset="21201586">The law makes no provision for the merger of properties owned by someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.248" offset="21232410">Thus, involuntary mergers are outside the scope of the present law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.145" offset="21259995">Now, complementing these boundaries upon the Commission's authority is Section 5 (2) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act which specifies that before the Commission may exercise its authority, it must find that the proposed transaction is within the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.761" offset="21358425">In other words, in this case, that the rail merger is a merger, the properties of which are owned either by an applicant or by a petitioner for including, for inclusion in the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.280" offset="21424462">Now, on the merits of the issue of who owns of the main line right-of-way used and operated by Northern Pacific Railway Company since 1896, the Commission's -- the committee's position is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.151" offset="21512025">First, we want to draw the distinction between the main line right-of-way with its franchise in federal tax exemption between that properties or those properties and other properties of railways such as land grant lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.556" offset="21585586">The properties of a federally chartered main line right-of-way with its franchise and tax exemption privilege, that property has a quality of inalienability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.778" offset="21662490">The company which receives such property from Congress, from the United States Government may not, may not transfer it voluntarily except on the authority of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.830" offset="21746709">It is our position that Congress never enacted the necessary concept legislation to transfer title of the main line right-of-way with the franchise and tax exemption privilege from railroad to railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.717" offset="21838242">Now, contrary to the position of railway which has been uncritically accepted by the Commission, the resolution of May 31, 1870 was no consent to the purported transfer from railroad, the federally chartered company, to railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.511" offset="21941373">The joint resolution of 1870 authorized railroad to issue bonds in aid of construction and it also authorized railroad to place a mortgage to secure these bonds on railroad's properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.880" offset="22022875">Shortly thereafter, within two months thereafter in fact, a mortgage -- bonds were indeed issued and mortgages were placed -- a mortgage was placed on railroads property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.610" offset="22073762">Subsequently, there was default and the committee of bondholders had a foreclosure sale bought in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.673" offset="22106049">Later on, the property was re-conveyed to the railroad company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.518" offset="22129455">Subsequently, other mortgages, other bonds were issued and other mortgages were placed on the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.132" offset="22163937">Three of these mortgages were involved in the so-called foreclosure sale of 1896.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.656" offset="22189955">And it is from this sale that railway claims good title to the property of the main line right-of-way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.662" offset="22229974">Now, this foreclosure sale was analyzed in the Boyd case by this Court, the Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.330" offset="22272711">In that case, an asinine of a remote creditor of railroad sought to enforce his rights against railway as a successor to railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.788" offset="22322552">Railway defended on the basis that his rights, the creditor's rights, had been wiped out by the foreclosure and the foreclosure sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.460" offset="22369259">All three courts agreed that railroad's creditor should prevail and their basic reason was that the foreclosure proceeding, the foreclosure, the foreclosure sale was one of form and not of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.586" offset="22433729">The facts of the transaction as provided in the cases and noted in the committee's brief bear out this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.485" offset="22469360">In effect, the stockholders and bondholders engaged in a private agreement to effectuate a transfer of title of railways -- railroads property, a federal chartered company to railway which at that time was nothing, but a paper corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.738" offset="22566327">By no standard of law could this be done in view of the inalienability of the kind of the property we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.243" offset="22608332">And certainly, the capacity for these private individuals to work out this sort of an arrangement was not enlarged by the mere fact of their use of a judicial forum which in this case was a consent foreclosure decree of the shadowy character for this foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.627" offset="22697880">In this foreclosure sale is further indicated by the fact that the very court which issued the foreclosure -- and which issued the foreclosure decree made a reservation in its foreclosure decree of the question of the validity of the mortgages being foreclosed and this question was raised by one of the intervening parties in the foreclosure, in the foreclosure proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.346" offset="22812714">And this reservation of the question of the validity of the mortgage being foreclosed was carried out not only in the decree, in the master sale and the Court order confirming the master sale and subsequently in the deeds of conveyance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Valentine B. Deale</label>
            <text syncTime="5712.313" offset="22952626">This is correct, Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.652" offset="22966000">It is suggested here that if the courts in the Boyd case for the benefit of an asinine of a remote creditor can cut through the judicial tracking of a consent foreclosure decree for the benefit of such a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.437" offset="23053145">Surely, the same can be done when we talked about the rights of the public interest and welfare which the charters -- which the charter provisions were designed to secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5753.039" offset="23115525">Now, railway itself at the time of the foreclosure proceeding recognized that support of legislation was necessary in order to affect the transfer of the railroad's properties to railway and this is without regard mind you, without regard to any question as to the validity of the foreclosure decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.964" offset="23215208">Congress, nevertheless, did not accede to railways' wishes and did not give the necessary authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.039" offset="23255542">Indeed, Congress has actually left open this question of who has title to the right-of-way used and operated by railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.666" offset="23302040">In the Act of June 25, 1929, this was an Act which authorized the United States to prosecute suits against the railway and railroad to quiet titles owned by the -- to quiet titles to land owned by the United States against claims by a railroad and railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.624" offset="23393886">And in that Act, Congress provided as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.479" offset="23413321">The provisions of this Act shall be -- shall not be construed as affecting the present title of Northern Pacific Railroad Company or its successor the Northern Pacific Railway Company or any subsidiary of either or both in the right-of-way of said road or lands actually used in good faith by the Northern Pacific Railway Company in the operation of said road.</text>
            <text syncTime="5856.746" offset="23530350">This language is certainly not language which recognizes any kind of title in railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.349" offset="23564727">Further, the issue that we're raising here has never been adjudicated by any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.866" offset="23606836">To be sure there has been some title language that has been used in cases, in the Boyd case particularly, in the land grant case and in the Landell case, but in none of those cases was the issue in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.625" offset="23681860">In the Boyd case, as we pointed out, was simply a case of creditor's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.718" offset="23702235">In the land grant case, the enabling statute specifically excluded the question of title to railways' right-of-way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.885" offset="23750928">And in the Landell case, minority stockholders attempted to raise this issue, but they were foreclosed from doing so by a summary judgment of the Court on the basis of latches.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.600" offset="23813726">Now, the circuit threshold issue which the Livingston Anti-Merger Committee is raising is independent of this jurisdictional ownership issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.615" offset="23881853">The committee's position is that when railway -- taking railway's position that it succeeded to railroad and to the right-of-way of railroad, it succeeded to railroad with all the burden and the liabilities and obligations that were attached to the federal charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.559" offset="23981641">When Congress granted railroad a 400-foot wide, 21,000-mile long right-of-way, it did so together with 40 million acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.554" offset="24053635">It understandably included, in the federal charter, protective provisions to assure that in perpetuity, this National Highway would be maintained as a continuous line for the benefit of the public interest and welfare and also to serve certain Governmental services.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.924" offset="24147048">Now, two of these protective provisions are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="6015.403" offset="24165021">One, there is a prohibition against merger of this road; secondly, there is a prohibition against placing on the road, any lien or mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.193" offset="24220191">These protective provisions, we submit run with the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.920" offset="24239104">They are more than merely personal limitations upon the original federal grantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6043.350" offset="24276720">Now, in opposing this view, railway has noted that it has placed, indeed has placed several mortgages on the properties without congressional consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.125" offset="24331891">The implication is that another mortgage which is called for by this merger would be alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.644" offset="24365955">Now, there is ample authority in case law from this Court to support the proposition that the continuance of an unauthorized act does not make it right or that the lack of an enforcement of a statutory provision does not affect any appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.248" offset="24448397">Railway further suggests and the Commission seems to go along with the contention that the plenary authority of the Commission to approve mergers is enough to sweep away the protective provisions of the federal charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.381" offset="24528854">There are three reasons why this view was unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.911" offset="24554977">First, it is too much to suppose that the general language describing the Commission's plenary authority with respect to mergers overrides a particular right which Congress reserved onto itself in a railroad federal charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.285" offset="24640554">This is especially so, since both before and after Congress has granted the Commission of Authority to approve mergers, Congress reaffirmed its reservation of rights to alter, amend or repeal the federal charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.879" offset="24706905">Congress in effect, has preempted the provisions of the federal charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.859" offset="24734804">Now, there's precedent for this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6162.092" offset="24751731">This conclusion indeed had been confer -- had been concordant by the Department of Justice, by the Interstate Commerce Commission and by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6172.756" offset="24794363">And I refer to the Texas and Pacific case which is outlined in the committee's brief on pages 46 to 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="6183.974" offset="24839293">In this case, a federally chartered company, Texas and Pacific Railway Company had burdens in its charter which it wanted to get rid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.628" offset="24885896">One of the burdens was a limitation upon consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.950" offset="24903137">Another burden was a limitation upon the financial structure of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6207.765" offset="24934484">So, how did it go about getting rid of these burdens?</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.399" offset="24952978">It went to the Congress and asked the Congress to amend its federal charter and in the course of the legislative process, again, the Department of Justice, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Congress all agreed that the legislative route was the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6233.117" offset="25035839">Now, there is a further point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.001" offset="25043362">However, the authority of the Commission to approve mergers may be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6243.486" offset="25077321">It is not sufficient to abrogate a statutory contract made between the United States and the organizers, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and their successors and assigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.110" offset="25143777">This contract which was consummated upon delivery of its acceptance to President Lincoln on December 29, 1864, provided for a method of amendment by the congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.564" offset="25209605">Accordingly, if the terms of the contract are not satisfactory to the parties, the approach is to amend the contract and amendment of the contract is provided for by the terms of the contract and the terms of the contracts spell out that Congress has reserved its rights to alter, amend, or repeal the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.626" offset="25301870">And it is submitted therefore that under these terms, the Interstate Commerce Commission has no right to abrogate the terms of the contract and has no position to repudiate its terms by approving a proposed merger which contradicts the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.097" offset="25387760">Now, in summary, railroad officials, or railway officials themselves have recognized that what we're saying here that railway, if it did indeed take railroad's main line right-of-way, it took it (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.556" offset="25469576">In the hearings before the joint congressional committee on the investigation of the Northern Pacific Railroad land grants, railway officials recognized that it was properly subject to all the limitations and liabilities and obligations imposed upon the original company by the Granting Act, and two of those congressional impositions, is one, a prohibition against merger; and two, a prohibition against placing a mortgage or a lien on the main line right-of-way without congressional consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6383.581" offset="25637700">There are some procedural inadequacies and this is the third position of the committee namely, that the court below nor the Commission gave adequate attention to the foregoing threshold issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6398.401" offset="25696946">The hearing examiner indeed recited the contentions of the committee and he dismissed them under -- without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6409.999" offset="25743339">But his evaluations of the contentions were mere surface evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.980" offset="25771342">The Commission had no independent thoughts of its own subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="6423.815" offset="25798614">In other words, it accepted completely what the hearing examiners had to say about the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.974" offset="25831320">The court below while recognizing that the issues that we're raising are ones of great magnitude decided that the Commission really didn't have to look into the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.914" offset="25895058">Nevertheless, it acknowledged that should the court at some other day in the indefinite future have occasion to look into the issues which we're raising now and comes to another conclusion than that court can measure the impact of its decision on the then status of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.229" offset="25996309">Furthermore, the court below was completely silent on the issue of the currency of the congressional impositions in the federal charter prohibiting merger and mortgage without congressional consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6493.434" offset="26077080">In summary, the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the proposed merger because ownership in the federally chartered right-of-way continues to vest in railroad which is neither a merger applicant nor a third party petitioning for inclusion in the merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="6775.574" offset="27205674">Counsels for the appellees on these consolidated cases have agreed upon a division of their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6782.383" offset="27232946">I shall deal principally in -- with the illegal standards observed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in approving the merger of the Northern Lines responding to the several contestants of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6795.137" offset="27283937">Mr. Cox, a counsel for the railroads, will deal with the several factual factors and that went into the decision to merge these roads, including the many benefits to the shipping public and that it enrolled offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.054" offset="27347571">He additionally will respond to the contentions of the Northern Pacific Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6816.981" offset="27371290">He will be followed by Mr. Fred Tolan on behalf of 230 Pacific Northwest Shippers who will deal with the merger principally from the standpoint of the patrons of these roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.335" offset="27416743">And finally, Mr. Merrill and counsel for the Milwaukee will treat specifically with the conditions attached by the Commissions for the protection of that road.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.408" offset="27461047">The Public Utility Commissioner of Oregon who had initially opposed the merger before the Commission now supports it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6847.969" offset="27495215">He, however, relies on his brief and will not separately argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.980" offset="27519248">Ten years ago, a committee of the Congress criticized the nation's railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.966" offset="27551222">In a report it said, the railroad industry has not been sufficiently interested in self-help in such matters as consolidations and mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6871.508" offset="27589360">And last year, and this Court noted in the Penn-Central cases that the intervening years have marked a tremendous change and that the railroads now embarked upon a vast reorganization of rail transportation implementing the congressional policy of encouraging consolidation of the nation's railroads into a limited number of systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="6896.573" offset="27689671">Department of Justice has opposed that realignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6900.216" offset="27704195">At one stage or another, the department has opposed every major railroad consolidation of the past decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.493" offset="27745364">Its present attack -- the challenges of the very premise upon which the Commission cater for has authorized and approved railroad mergers and the rationale upon which the Courts on review have sustained them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6925.810" offset="27806595">Essentially, the question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6928.844" offset="27818715">May a consolidation of railroads be held to be in the public interest upon the Commission's finding of improved transportation, efficiencies and economies that the transport action itself will yield when weighed against the facts of evidence at the competitive consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="6947.440" offset="27893112">The Commission and the courts have said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.125" offset="27903875">The department has unsuccessfully maintained in the past, says no.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.600" offset="27937729">Its position is that acknowledged savings, operational improvements and service benefits flowing from the affiliation of railroads without more cannot serve and to offset the loss of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6971.318" offset="27988616">The Commission found and a unanimous lower court agreed, from that, the merger would produce savings of $40 million annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="6980.829" offset="28026650">The Commission found and the lower court agreed that would result in better service.</text>

            <text syncTime="7087.091" offset="28451715">And that is correct sir and before that time, the mergers were governed solely by the Sherman and the Clayton Acts and it was during this period that this Court decided in Northern Security's case and the Southern Pacific case consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7101.117" offset="28507826">Now, following the 1920 enactment, two acquisitions of control have reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7108.234" offset="28536351">And I specifically invite this Court's attention to its decisions in the New York Central Securities case and the Texas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.995" offset="28571355">Now, the most dramatic example under the Transportation Act of 1920 that the Commission could authorize from one railroad's acquisition of control of another, even in the face of the most serious anti-competitive consequences was afforded by the Southern Pacific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.490" offset="28649305">In 1922, this Court had found that the control of the Central Pacific by the Southern Pacific violated the Sherman Act and it ordered the divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.657" offset="28701968">Southern Pacific, however, in an effort to maintain control applied to the Commission for authorization under the provisions of the Transportation Act of 1920 enacted subsequently to the beginning of the anti-trust prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7166.709" offset="28770200">The Commission in its report found that separation of the lines would result in more expensive and less efficient and satisfactory service that can be rendered under unified control.</text>

            <text syncTime="7200.488" offset="28905305">The District Court of the District of Utah have found and that the mandate of this Court in essence was satisfied in that no divestiture was required, the Commission having found the control relationship to be consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7219.536" offset="28981478">It was not reviewed on the merits, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7224.035" offset="28999555">Now, none of these cases decided by the Commission, some of which were sustained by the Courts and it was the Commission's operate -- authorization premised upon findings such as the department now would insist upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="7238.469" offset="29057233">In the face of their evident anti-competitive effects and the proposals were approved by the Commission upon Commission's findings of improved transportation, the economy's inefficiencies that the trans-action itself would yield.</text>
            <text syncTime="7253.822" offset="29118673">The department discusses none of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7256.321" offset="29128704">It ignores altogether and to the important cases of the 1920 to 1940 formative period.</text>
            <text syncTime="7265.716" offset="29166216">By 1940, it had become apparent that the ambitious nationwide plan of consolidation which was a part of the 1920 Act was not bearing fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7276.907" offset="29211042">The Transportation Act of 1940 relieved the Commission of having to formulate the plan as that it permits the Commission to approve carry their initiated voluntary plans if consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7290.764" offset="29266422">And so the 40 Act permitted the Commission to approve acquisitions -- approve merges of railroads as it previously had acquisitions of control subject only to the standard of consistency with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7305.050" offset="29323577">And this Court has repeatedly said that the congressional purpose in this 1940 Act was to facilitate merger and consolidation in the national transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="7316.832" offset="29370702">The result of the Act and it was a change in the means while the end remained the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="7323.051" offset="29395571">We do not view Svenska Amerika as changing that and we do not think Svenska Amerika -- and America can be silent or in overruling decades of administrative and judicial construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7338.663" offset="29458056">Secondly, and most significant, in that proceeding and there were no benefits from the transaction from the agreements offered for Federal Maritime Commission approval and the Federal Maritime Commission specifically so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="7354.771" offset="29522422">But finally, there is no suggestion in Svenska Amerika that the kinds of improvements, service benefits found to flow from the transaction here approved by the Commission would not satisfy the requirement of Svenska Amerika.</text>
            <text syncTime="7372.400" offset="29592952">Beginning with the decision in the McLean case which incidentally involved a merger of seven motor carriers into the largest single motor carrier in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7386.648" offset="29650004">This Court has consistently held that under the 1940 Act as under the 1920 Act, the achieving of an adequate, efficient and economical system of transportation was a matter of paramount national concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="7403.284" offset="29716459">And the preservation of competition among carriers, although still of value is significant chiefly as it aids in the attainment of the objective of the national transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="7418.251" offset="29776332">Indeed, we show in our brief, that some of the very arguments in which the department now makes were considered and rejected by the Court in the McLean case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7431.400" offset="29828995">This Court's affirmance in 1967 of the Seaboard summary affirmance -- in 1967 of the Seaboard Coastline Merger under the standards of the 1940 Act was one of several occurrences in following the Commission's first report in the Northern Lines case and contributing to its change of mind in the approval of the Northern Lines' merger in the second report.</text>
            <text syncTime="7461.232" offset="29948322">In many of the characteristics in the Seaboard Coastline Merger were similar to that of the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7469.180" offset="29980087">Though from the standpoint of the anti-competitive consequences flowing from the transaction and we submit and that the present merger poses even more, even fewer problems, less onerous and then the early one the early one, the Seaboard Coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="7485.933" offset="30047065">Therein here, the merger involved two relatively healthy, parallel rail competitors, dominant in expensing an economically significant section of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="7497.374" offset="30092831">Although the net earnings of Seaboard Coastline and were found by the Commission to be better than they are in the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7506.221" offset="30128253">There is here, the merging railroads were each other's principal competitors, though again, the volume of traffic for which they competed, was greater for the Seaboard and Coastline than it is for the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7520.489" offset="30185305">They in here and the merger of the railroads and denied some communities of competitive rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="7527.029" offset="30211532">Although cities of the size of Tampa, and areas as extensive as Central and Western Florida served only by the merged Seaboard Coastline, are totally without counterpart in the Northern Lines merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="7628.071" offset="30615698">Indeed, in the lower court in its opinion, paraphrased the position of the department and said and the Government's position really was that where two healthy competitors are involved, economies or dollar savings and other alleged benefits should never be enough and to overcome severe elimination of competition such as here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7650.885" offset="30706918">Of course, the lower court rejected the department's argument and this Court summarily affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7659.181" offset="30740146">Turning to other considerations which occurred between the first and the second report, the first of these is the accommodation of the employees of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="7673.492" offset="30797302">In the first report, the Commission had found some 5200 jobs on the applicant railroads that would be eliminated and that the adverse effect due to bumping would be even more severe.</text>

            <text syncTime="7771.943" offset="31191124">I simply wish to point out that as a result of these conditions, the Milwaukee for the first time, and we'll be able to reach Portland, for the first time, will be able to render service at Billing and incidentally, this was a new condition in the second report, it was not considered for attachment in the first report.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fritz R. Kahn</label>
            <text syncTime="7794.764" offset="31282448">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="7796.934" offset="31291120">Thirdly, the Milwaukee, for the first time will be able to participate in West Coast traffic to and from Bridge Columbia and for the first time, the Milwaukee will be able to solicit Northern Tier transcontinental traffic originating at or destined to points not on its line by being able to interchange such traffic at competitive rates at 11 points certain in timing with the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7826.406" offset="31408985">And as the Commission found, this afforded to the shipper a slower club to short haul in the merge system in the event that he is not satisfied with the treatment he's getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="7838.199" offset="31456214">In its third supplemental report, the Commission specifically opened these 11 gateways into the transportation of grain destined for the primary markets I Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sioux City.</text>
            <text syncTime="7852.134" offset="31511907">At these conditions, will make up the Milwaukee a new railroad can scarcely be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7859.442" offset="31541164">As I pointed out at the outset, they were considered of sufficient consequence that the Public Utility Commission of Oregon would oppose the merger before the Commission following the imposition of the conditions supported the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7875.126" offset="31603858">And more importantly, the Secretary of Agriculture, charged under the statute with representing the agricultural community considered them to be a benefit to the public in general and to the agricultural community in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="7891.488" offset="31669373">And accordingly before the Commission, he too changed his position and following imposition of the condition withdrew his opposition to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7901.571" offset="31709706">Lastly, among the conditions to obtain between the first and second report, was the receipt of additional evidence as to the savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="7912.890" offset="31754951">In the first report, as I indicated before in response and to the question to Mr. Justice Harlan the Commission had found, I believe it was, the Commission had found that the savings might be $25.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="7931.293" offset="31828511">However, without explanation and bringing this figure down to its conclusion, the Commission found that the savings might only reach $12.7 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="7942.997" offset="31875323">And it was this figure, the range of $12.7 million to $25.5 million annually a guess at which the Commission measured the anti-competitive consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="7955.789" offset="31926523">Following the receipt of additional evidence, the analysis of additional studies and the Commission concluded that the annual savings would approach $40 million and the lower court agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7969.600" offset="31981798">In reaching this conclusion, I might point out that the Commission did indeed consider the possibility and that certain savings, certain improvements might be achieved short of merger by the coordination of facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="7991.676" offset="32070092">At best, these would have yielded as the Commission found at 300 of the record, as the Commission mentioned that 300 of the record a $5.2 million, but the Commission went on to state specifically many of the coordinations though physically feasible will produce grossly unequal benefits to Great Northern, Northern Pacific a separate carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8017.291" offset="32172492">Further, in a competition between the Northern Lines, it renders it difficult if not impossible as a practical matter to incur the expense involved in effecting such coordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="8034.052" offset="32239574">It is against these benefits then that the lessening of competition the Commission said must be weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8041.266" offset="32268413">And that there will be a very substantial lessening of competition has never been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="8046.132" offset="32287848">The Commission referred to this as an undisputed fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="8049.783" offset="32302477">And as -- indeed as I believe Mr. Justice Black pointed out this morning, it's scarcely possible to conceive of a significant merger of railroads in an area that would not be anti-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="8062.666" offset="32353991">But that is not to say that these anti-competitive consequences can be ignored by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="8068.736" offset="32378337">And the Commission very carefully referring to this Court's decision in McClain, in Minneapolis, in Seaboard Coastline said that it has a duty to estimate the scope and appraise the effects of the curtailment of competition which will result from the proposed consolidation and consider them along with the advantages of improved service, safer operations, lower cost, etcetera to determine whether the consolidation will assist in effectuating overall transportation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="8098.431" offset="32497142">This we submit, the Commission has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="8103.524" offset="32517517">The Commission noted that Great Northern and Northern Pacific are competitive and that their lines extend generally through the same Northern Tier States and from Seattle and Portland on the west, to Duluth Superior, Minneapolis, Saint Paul on the east, but they are also complementary and that the Great Northern's principle mileage is in the east and Northern Pacific's in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="8127.876" offset="32614902">And while their lines are parallel and Great Northern primarily serves northern communities in the Northern Tier States, and while the Northern Pacific serves those towards the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="8141.580" offset="32669654">And at many points as the Commission pointed out as between Helena and Shelby, Montana the main lines of these railroads are several -- are better than a hundred miles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="8154.314" offset="32720645">And the Commission pointed out that obviously a shipper located on or near in the line on one road, and but 50 or 100 miles from the line of another is not influenced by the competition in the selection of the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8172.014" offset="32791385">In our brief, we offer many examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="8175.066" offset="32803610">We quote for example a Montana grain dealer who has elevators near the Northern Pacific tracks, and he said, “For the most part, the grain has to move on the railroad pretty close to where it's grown.</text>
            <text syncTime="8189.701" offset="32862124">For instance I can't ship on the Milwaukee if it even if their rate is zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="8196.384" offset="32888874">”The Commission in the second report indeed recognized and that the Northern Tier States are rich in animal, mineral, agricultural and forest resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="8208.089" offset="32935685">It recognized full well that this cost, this traffic constitutes as Mr. McLaren pointed out, approximately 60% of the traffic originated by these roads in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="8223.005" offset="32995349">As -- it is for this very traffic that rail transportation offers the most and distinct competitive advantage to use as phrase, were the greatest inherent advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="8236.477" offset="33049266">But we point out in our brief that with respect to this very traffic, 80% comes from points that are none competitive between the merging railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="8251.263" offset="33108407">The Department at no time has challenged these figures, neither has the Department ever challenged the fact and the truck competition has become very pervasive at least as to one category of products, manufacture and miscellaneous products.</text>
            <text syncTime="8269.021" offset="33179460">It was with respect to this category of traffic and that the Commission specifically found in the second report that these railroads are most vulnerable to motor carrier competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="8281.302" offset="33228570">It found moreover that it is this traffic that the rail carriers must retain to balance their operations in handling the products of the agricultural and extracted industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="8295.594" offset="33285726">The record establishes and the Commission so found that this category of traffic manufactured in miscellaneous products constitutes more than 30% of the Great Northern's carload revenue and nearly 40% of the Northern Pacific, and for both road its the single most important category of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="8318.272" offset="33376423">Now with respect to the much quoted in exhibit 16 referred to in the Commission's report, second report in the vicinity of page 316 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="8334.338" offset="33440684">The Commission acknowledged full well and its second report as it had in its first that rail competition will be eliminated entirely at 47 communities in the northern tier.</text>
            <text syncTime="8349.769" offset="33502438">However, the Commission went on and to point that the number of stations is small, being less than 5% of the stations in those very states, and it went on to point out that these stations produced an insubstantial volume of applicant's business, approximately 6% whether measured by cars or revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="8375.102" offset="33603793">Additionally, the Commission found with these so called class -- with respect to these so called class one points that some of them are located on the main line of one applicant and on the branch line of another and with the result that the loss of competition is more theoretical than real.</text>
            <text syncTime="8395.672" offset="33686026">Helena, Montana is a perfectly good example, it being on the main line of the Northern Pacific, but on the branch line of the Great Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="8405.462" offset="33725210">With respect to the class two stations, those served by two or more of the applicant railroads and at least one other railroad, the Commission acknowledged in its second report as it had in the first that rail competition will be diminished, but not eliminate it at these 160 stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="8427.005" offset="33811414">It recognized in the second report as it had in the first that these stations contribute about 33% of the cars and 38% of the revenue of the northern lines in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="8439.432" offset="33861151">Mr. McLaren would add all these figures including overhead traffic and tell you that the railroad's merger would result in a loss of competition of 55%.</text>
            <text syncTime="8456.010" offset="33927398">Mr. McLaren forgets however, that the addition of the bridge traffic it increases its universe and as the Examiner found at page 770 of the record, 771, if bridge traffic were included that percentage of the total traffic handled in 1960 at the stations where there will be a reduction in the number of rail carriers would be smaller than the figures subsequently shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="8488.401" offset="34056965">We point out that at nearly two thirds of these class two stations served by two of the applicants and one other road, with respect to these, we point out that 97 and out of the 160 stations, nearly two thirds all occur at four places; Seattle, Spokane, Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Duluth, Superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="8520.329" offset="34184652">And it is with respect to these points that the Commission in its second report specifically found that following the merger, none would be served by fewer than three railroads nor fewer than 15 truck lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="8537.409" offset="34252988">The Commission in its second report pointed out that even though some of the points show up as class two stations reflecting service by two or more of the applicant railroads and at least one other, they do not have competition between the applicants today.</text>
            <text syncTime="8556.287" offset="34328534">For example, the largest community in the northern tier which would be left without competitive rail service as a result of the merger is Pasco, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="8570.695" offset="34386108">At Pasco, Washington the Northern Pacific comes in from one direction, and the SP&amp;S goes out in another direction and the competition between them is really nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="8582.961" offset="34435218">As to all of the points, all of the class two points, the Commission found first apportionment of traffic between Great Northern and Northern Pacific and the other road serving these points is not wholly the result of interplay of competitive forces, but often results from other factors entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="8603.686" offset="34518079">Second, the shippers at these class two locations in addition to the northern lines and one other rail carrier, are generally served by other modes of transportation vigorously competing for traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="8617.400" offset="34572936">And third, by virtue of the conditions imposed in this case, the Milwaukee which is the other railroad serving many of the class two points will be substantially strengthened as a meaningful transcontinental competitor.</text>

            <text syncTime="8651.918" offset="34711071">Beginning at page 48 of our brief, we offer examples drawn from the record which fully support he Commission's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="8660.625" offset="34745866">We show how some shippers and this is particularly true of the large national accounts, simply allocate traffic as between available rail carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8669.757" offset="34782438">We show the number, the growth and the activity of truck lines at the class two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="8675.715" offset="34806262">At Fargo for example, 20 motor carriers compete for traffic with the railroad and the record establishes in that 50% of the less than car load merchandise traffic received there arrives by truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="8693.031" offset="34875538">And we point out that the Commission found that the Milwaukee has shorter routes and superior rate and will offer competitive service right through the heart of the northern tier serving most of the class two stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="8708.961" offset="34939173">Moreover, the Commission in its second report accorded much weight to the many shippers, trade associations and other groups which supported the merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="8908.312" offset="35736639">We do believe that consistently with this Court's holding last year in the Penn-Central merger cases, the Commission has furthered the policy of the Congress.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh B. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="9027.367" offset="36212799">That underlies the problem and I suppose that you could find an economist who would say the more competition you suppress, the more savings and benefits you get.</text>
            <text syncTime="9038.015" offset="36255431">But it's a question of fact in each case, I suppose and it is our view of the statute that what Congress has done here is to direct and authorize the committee to consider the elimination of competition on the one hand, and the benefits to transportation services and facilities on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="9063.384" offset="36356890">And having made that consideration to decide on the facts of a particular case, and not by the application of some rule of law, general application, but decide on the facts of that particular case whether the merger or preservation of the competition will do more to provide -- improve adequate and economical transportation service, which is the standard that we find in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="9092.082" offset="36471724">Now that as we see it was the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="9097.749" offset="36494399">It's our view of the Commission in the second report did exactly, went to exactly that process which is the process that the Court described in the McLean case in language which is frequently reiterated.</text>
            <text syncTime="9112.751" offset="36554376">That it weighed the adverse effects on competition against the benefits, improvements in transportation services and facilities on the other, and it decided on balance that the merger would do more to provide adequate, economical and efficient transportation service in this area of the country with the conditions attached than would preservation of the competition between the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="9141.698" offset="36670151">They made findings on this and in our view those findings are supported by substantial evidence and they provide a reason, a basis for what the Commission did.</text>
            <text syncTime="9152.499" offset="36713409">Now if the Court adheres, I submit to what it is said in the past, that should be the end of this case, but the Government's argument is a little protean.</text>
            <text syncTime="9163.893" offset="36758967">I have trouble sometimes getting my hands on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9167.195" offset="36772133">I'm never quite sure whether the Department of Justice is arguing for a new rule of law which in effect says that service improvements are not enough, improvements in transportation services are not enough, there must be something over and beyond those services before you can authorize a merger that suppresses competition, substantial competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="9192.533" offset="36873488">Now whether that is really their argument or whether they are in effect inviting this Court to review the record de novo and make an independent determination on whether the court believes this merger is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="9206.536" offset="36929494">But the argument seems to me to be suspended rather uneasily between those two extremes.</text>
            <text syncTime="9212.647" offset="36953945">Now, in view of that it was my intention this afternoon to talk a little bit about the facts because I think any way you look at this case, the facts deserve some consideration and perhaps more consideration than they get from – in the argument of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="9229.355" offset="37020818">While it is quite true they deal with these facts in the sense, but they deal with them in a rather curious technique by admitting them they discount them.</text>
            <text syncTime="9240.834" offset="37066689">So that when they say, "Well, of course we admit there'd be some system, service improvements here," I don't think the Court gets from that the full force and flavor of what this record shows about what this merger means.</text>
            <text syncTime="9254.817" offset="37122591">And with the Court's permission I would like to talk a little bit about that, even though I suppose some sort of respects the Assistant Attorney General will not dispute these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="9268.049" offset="37175568">Now, these is a mass of evidence in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="9270.469" offset="37185285">There are 14,000 pages of transcript, 240 exhibits on Examiner's report, it takes up most of two volumes of the appendix here.</text>
            <text syncTime="9280.692" offset="37226141">And a great deal of it is related to the benefits of this merger, the service benefits, the improvement in the service and facilities and it's not general abstract evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="9291.207" offset="37268250">It's particularized evidence about particular commodities, particular markets, particular routes and particular shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9299.119" offset="37299806">And I can't possibly do justice to it but there are three sort of categories to this evidence I'd like to say something about.</text>
            <text syncTime="9306.209" offset="37328227">First, evidence that has to do with the faster and more reliable service, now that's been mentioned here this morning, the expedited schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="9318.113" offset="37375875">There are a number of examples of those I could give to the Court, makes a difference in points in the Yakima Valley of 12 hours to Chicago and 24 hours to Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="9329.590" offset="37421746">Some points west of Spokane, it means 24 hours difference to Chicago in immediate point, the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="9338.240" offset="37456332">Some points in North Dakota and Montana, it means 24 hours to -- faster than Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="9343.940" offset="37479111">Now the real point, the way the Department of Justice apparently tries to deal with that is to say, “Well, the carriers could do this anyway without merger.”</text>
            <text syncTime="9355.550" offset="37525608">This anticipates the point that I intended to deal with a little later, but I will say this about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="9361.917" offset="37551000">There is evidence in this record, not in the record, but there's evidence which everybody has taken and no question about it that while this proceeding was pending the Milwaukee put on a fast train between Chicago and Seattle and I might pause here and add that arguably enough, there was also evidence that the reason they did that was because of fear of truck competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="9386.067" offset="37647653">The Northern Lines responded by putting on fast trains and the -- we are told that that shows that all these improved schedules could be achieved without merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="9397.330" offset="37692688">Well now, the fact is and the Commissions referred to this in its second report, not the -- it's really the third report, it's the second report on reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="9407.478" offset="37733334">These trains that the Milwaukee and that two Northern Lines put on between Chicago and Seattle are lightweight, light tonnage trains which they put extra power, which means of course they're carrying -- they're paying more for every ton of freight they carry on those trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="9426.567" offset="37809612">There's one of those trains each way, each day, except by one of the Northern Lines which I believe skips Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="9434.490" offset="37841377">Now, in contrast, what this merger will do will be is provide faster schedules for the fast trains, but it's going to provide faster schedules for all the trains, the regular freight trains and not only the transcontinental trains, but these intermediate trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="9451.534" offset="37909504">So that the suggestion that these lightweight, light tonnage trains which the Commission took into account, prove that the carriers can do these improved schedules without merger, I submit is not really supported by the rational consideration of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="9470.377" offset="37984841">Now, the other kind of improvement, the two other things I should like to mention, one is the improvement in car supply, which this merger will bring which is a very serious matter in this part of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="9483.047" offset="38035519">That improvement will come in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="9485.316" offset="38044609">In the first place, the improvement in schedules, the elimination of interchanges and the elimination of switching time, turnaround time in the yards is going to make more cars available and there's a reasoned conservative estimate in the record for the Commission that this will mean about 1700 additional cars daily, which will be available for loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="9512.255" offset="38152443">Now that's one way the car supply will be improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="9516.213" offset="38168221">Another way it will be improved which is of great significance is that under -- when the lines are merged, of course cars will be centralized.</text>
            <text syncTime="9527.686" offset="38214092">There'll be a centralized control for the dispatch and distribution of the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="9534.835" offset="38242722">Today there is evidence to this kind in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="9537.168" offset="38252022">Those lines will sometimes stand idle on one of the lines, while the point not too far away, the shipper is waiting for a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="9545.201" offset="38284204">Well, when you have one agency distributing those cars over the system that kind of things certainly be reduced and maybe eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="9555.940" offset="38327150">Now the third thing that I should like to mention about these service benefits because -- so that the Court will get some sense of what's in this record is a mass of evidence that has to do with the effect of improved through routes and single line service which is often in many cases, some commodities are cheaper than even through rates by two railroad and the transit and loading and unloading privileges which this merger will make available to shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="9591.915" offset="38471032">Now, this evidence proves and it rather surprised me that that these shippers attached great importance to these transit and loading and unloading privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="9601.168" offset="38508022">What they mean briefly is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9604.048" offset="38519515">That if a shipper ships over the line of the single railroad and he wants to stop the car and have the product processed in some way and then move on, or if he wants to send -- start out a car half loaded and then load it completely, or if he wants to unload it, if that takes place on the line of a single railroad, it -- shipper can do it with the transfer privilege on the single line or through rate which is an advantageous rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9636.485" offset="38649292">But if, when he stops it from processing or loading or unloading, he wants to have it move on over another railroad, he pays what is in effect a higher rate, something like a combination rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9650.134" offset="38703940">Now, what this merger does is to make those privileges available to system wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="9657.256" offset="38732361">They are not now because the Northern Lines don't extend this kind of privilege to one another, but available over the entire system as well as over in many parts of the Milwaukee as a result of the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9670.982" offset="38787323">And anyone who flavors the testimony, even in the Examiner's report might ask, you don't have to go on the record to see what importance the shippers attached, economic importance, to these particular privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="9686.988" offset="38851375">They open up markets for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="9689.116" offset="38859839">They will enable a man in Nebraska who hasn't been able to -- a shipper, a lumber shipper in the first instance to the northwest who wants to have lumber processed in Nebraska and sold in Missouri to do it for the first time at a rate which will enable him to compete with lumber moving from another part of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="9708.998" offset="38939355">Now, I should like now to turn although I have to some extent anticipated myself to this question of whether these things can be done without merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="9719.757" offset="38982405">I have talked about the freight, the expedited schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="9727.641" offset="39013961">I think Mr. Kahn has made the point which was not I think left entirely clear in the argument this morning that the Commission did make some findings on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9738.654" offset="39057951">The -- they made the findings that Mr. Kahn referred to and the Examiner made a finding that there was no reasonable expectation that these railroads could achieve these improvements in service, or these coordinations if they remained independent competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="9759.780" offset="39142484">I think that the findings that the Commission made on that represent one area of agreement between the first and the second reports, because in the first report the majority of the Commission there said, “We agree that these carriers as competitors will not and cannot as a practical matter make the coordinations from which they derive grossly unequal benefits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="9786.838" offset="39250735">And the Commission in the second report found that most of these instances, these coordinations would or facilities would produce grossly unequal benefits, and therefore that as a practical matter, it was not reasonable to expect the railroads to make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="9806.895" offset="39330983">Now this can be illustrated and again to give you some flavor of the record, I should like to descend into details, it maybe a little bit variorum, and I think they may be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="9818.726" offset="39378317">One of the things that's going to be done on this merger is to coordinate routes so that the trains of the combined system move over the best and most expeditious route.</text>
            <text syncTime="9829.120" offset="39419904">For example, on the main line west, the main route will be composed of a segment of the line, the present line of the Northern Pacific from the Twin Cities to a point in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="9844.517" offset="39481448">At that point, the traffic will move on to what is now the main line of the Great Northern, which is a much better line, in many respects and will move on the line of the Great Northern all the way across the top of the country to Sandpoint in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="9862.982" offset="39555323">At that point, the traffic will be moved over to a line of the Northern Pacific to go to Spokane, and then from Spokane it will move on to the coast over a line of the Great Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="9877.643" offset="39613942">Now, if you stop to think about it that is the kind of thing, they're running, they're going to be running common trains that cannot be done by two, as a practical matter, by two independent competing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="9890.864" offset="39666813">Despite some suggestions this morning to the contrary, the Commission has no authority to compel one railroad to give another railroad trackage rights over its line.</text>
            <text syncTime="9904.114" offset="39719790">So that if any railroads try to do this, there would have to be arrangements for compensation worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="9910.432" offset="39745076">And since this is going to be done system wide on all the routes, what you would have to think about would be the two railroads sitting down to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="9921.829" offset="39790738">They were going to run trains over one another's routes, perhaps mixed trains, how they were going to pay one another for the -- on a fair basis for the advantages that each got out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9936.953" offset="39851133">Now, I submit if you stop to think about that quite apart from the practical difficulties which would I think would make the exchange ratio look easy, apart from those, you couldn't do that without ending what would practically a de facto pooling of revenues and sharing of profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="9955.672" offset="39926053">And that relationship could hardly be consistent with really effective and vigorous competition between the two lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="9964.504" offset="39961370">So this coordination of routes -- as a Commission and I should add here that the Commission in the first report, in the report which disapproved the merger, the Commission there found that coordination of routes between competing railroads was ordinarily not practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="9983.124" offset="40035871">So here again, there's really no dispute about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9986.674" offset="40050082">Now, the coordination of the routes is an essential part of all these improvements of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="9992.865" offset="40074846">It's obvious that it has a direct relationship with the schedules of the car supply, but it's also essential to the coordination of these terminal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="10002.302" offset="40112567">And the reason for that is that in order to construct these new terminal facilities, you have to rearrange the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="10009.237" offset="40140361">You have difficulty getting ground and cities usually of the appropriate kind and in most of these cities the two railroads come into the city from different directions as they do for example in St. Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="10024.696" offset="40202115">So that what as an essential part of building a common yard, a common switching and assembly yard, the trunk line traffic has to be moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="10035.740" offset="40246314">As I explained a moment ago, all of that trunk line traffic in St. Paul is going to come in to St. Paul, the main traffic, east and west over a line of the Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="10046.841" offset="40290722">Now, that is also true in these other terminals in Spokane and in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="10053.808" offset="40318621">Where they -- to do the terminal arrangements, they have to coordinate the routes, really they have to run mixed trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="10060.645" offset="40345997">Now, that again is not the kind of saying that can be done, these yards effectively and efficiently between two competing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="10072.987" offset="40395316">Of course to have a yard in which there are two companies operating, they're both -- each other is going to be want to be sure it gets its trains out just as quick as the other fellow does.</text>
            <text syncTime="10082.493" offset="40433351">You'll have duplicate yards, duplicate shipping crews, it's a switching crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="10087.670" offset="40454040">You can't do these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="10089.289" offset="40460518">Indeed, there is here I think a strange internal inconsistency in the argument of the anti-trust division which I think is worse comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10101.183" offset="40508061">If you did, could do all these things, these by voluntary coordinations between the carriers, what you would have would be the two carriers running mixed or combined trains with common crews, over each other's routes using common terminals and common repair facilities, in some degree, presumably using a managerial staff in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="10131.271" offset="40628433">They'd still have to have a common agency distributing the freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="10135.941" offset="40647137">You would have a relationship, a cooperative relationship that would be inconsistent with the existence of the kind of competition that the anti-trust division says it should be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="10150.133" offset="40703875">And indeed, it somewhat surprises me to hear them taking this line in this case because in other context, they have frequently pointed out the dangers and indeed the illegality that will arise from these cooperative and joint undertakings, which is exactly what they seem to be arguing for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="10175.318" offset="40804603">I think that I should now like to speak briefly to the -- to one matter and leave it without much comment and that's the matter of the savings to the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="10190.582" offset="40865729">I should merely like to point out to the Court that there is a direct relationship between the improvements in service and of the savings because the savings come in large part, not entirely, but in large part from the coordination of facilities and from the quicker routes and the other steps that will produce the better service to the shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="10216.722" offset="40970219">So that it is a mistake to think of these savings as being of only in direct benefit to the shippers, because they do have a direct relationship to the service improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="10229.879" offset="41022882">But apart from that the Commission made findings which all relate to matters that's entitled to give weight to under Section 5 (2), which pointed out that the savings would increase the pressure -- decrease the pressure for rate increases which comes from increasing costs that they would -- by improving the rate of return of the carriers put them in a better position to buy a modern and improved equipment, and that they would increase their capacity and power to compete with the trucks, which is -- and other modes of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10268.229" offset="41176273">Now the Department of Justice as I said in the beginning seems to admit these are --- these benefits exist in a way, but it says that they really are not important as against the loss of competition will be caused by the merger of the two Northern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="10292.859" offset="41274807">And as I said earlier, their view seems to be that almost as a matter of law you need something beside improvements in transportation services and facilities, you need something over and above and beyond that of a more extraordinary character.</text>

            <text syncTime="10371.132" offset="41587858">Now we've developed this legal argument in our brief and I don't want to retread what Mr. Kahn has said, but we point out in our brief a number of things about that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="10381.668" offset="41630072">One is that the act itself almost by term shows that Congress was not prepared to rely upon competition producing its benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="10391.862" offset="41670823">And we all -- we point out specifically that in the adequacy of transportation service is one of the four things in Section 5 (2) (c) that the Commission is required to give weight to when it is asked to consider a merger, and we also point out that the national transportation policy, which of course pervades in the degree the interpretation of the provisions of the acts, speaks in terms of efficient, economical, adequate and safe transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="10428.991" offset="41819303">Now, it is our view that you look at the statute and you look at the provisions of the statute, the very kinds of benefits that this case produces to shippers are the kinds of benefits that the Congress authorized the Commission to consider, and if it had a reasoned judgment on the matter and evidence to support it, could decide, justify the merger that suppressed substantial competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="10456.933" offset="41931107">And of course we argue too from the McLean case and the Sea Board case particularly that they were precisely cases of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="10464.995" offset="41963395">That's what the Commission did and this Court sustained it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh B. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="10487.773" offset="42054510">When they're -- well, I couldn't honestly say that I could read their briefs that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="10493.573" offset="42077706">I -- as I have said before, I have some difficulty in getting it and analyzing it precisely, but I would say they do say that you can't ever have a merger in that situation unless you have some very extraordinary and special benefit that goes far beyond improvements of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="10512.939" offset="42155133">And the only two I know anything about are the New Haven situation or the bankrupt carrier that's a -- now, Mr. Kahn has discussed the competitive effect of this merger was particularly with the view to suggesting that the department has exaggerated the quantitative extent to which competition is affected, and I don't want to cover any of that ground again.</text>
            <text syncTime="10546.838" offset="42290761">There are some things about the competitive situation that I think it might be useful for me to speak very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="10567.091" offset="42371741">One of them asked the -- they really relate not so much to the quantity of competition that is eliminated, but to the economic significance of that elimination and particularly economic significance in relation to the adequacy, efficiency and economy of transportation services because I think it's important to remember here that we, at least in our view, are not operating under a statute which gives the competition as such or in the abstract some overriding and controlling importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="10604.829" offset="42522728">It is an important consideration and the Commission treated it as being important, but it's important as it relates to the contribution it makes to good and improved transportation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="10618.230" offset="42576332">Now, so that economic consequences in that sense to which I wish to speak very briefly, the Committee -- the argument for the Department of Justice I think rolls together a number of things, specifically two of them particularly which are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="10638.428" offset="42657102">I think this has been clear, but I should like to be sure it's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="10642.892" offset="42674970">They take the traffic at points where there are only the two Northern lines and they combine that with the points at which there are the two Northern lines and one or more, sometimes three or four other railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="10659.357" offset="42740799">Now of course the effect of this merger at those points is quite different, there's a significant difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="10666.166" offset="42768071">At the points where you have only the Northern lines, the two Northern lines, you remove all way of competition by this merger, but those points are not significant enough, either in terms of value of -- on the volume of traffic produced, or in the markets they serve to support the argument on the other side, so they have to combine the 6% of the revenues that come from points of that kind, that is where there are only the two Northern lines, with the revenues from the points where there are other railroads in addition to the Northern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="10707.039" offset="42931493">And it's that way they derive their percentage of 43 or 44% which is said to be the effect of the extent to which it eliminates competition at least on a station basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="10721.223" offset="42988231">Now, I have said that there is a difference between the two situations and it's obvious, it is the question I suppose really is, if you eliminate one of three or four railroads, how economically significant is that in this industry in relation to the service and the rate the shipper will get?</text>
            <text syncTime="10745.102" offset="43083734">It -- true, it is an elimination or a reduction of competition, but there's nothing in this record that suggests in any way that the elimination of one of several competing railroads in this industry has effects that are quite as devastating on railroad service and railroad rates, as the argument on the other side suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="10768.258" offset="43176417">And there's some pretty hard empirical evidence that points in the contrary direction, that is the evidence of the shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="10775.963" offset="43207241">Now, there are large number of shippers who testified here, and a great many of these shippers came from these points where there will be a reduction by one in a number of railroads serving the points.</text>
            <text syncTime="10788.807" offset="43258650">Yet all of these shippers, practically unanimous, all of these shippers while saying, “Competition is a good thing, and we like competition,” all of them supported this merger particularly as it was conditioned to protect the Milwaukee and the Northwestern.</text>
            <text syncTime="10808.278" offset="43336495">Now that evidence seems to me to indicate pretty clearly that the shippers at least, so long as they have two or more railroads, believe that the benefits of this merger to them in their pragmatic judgment, the benefits of this merger to them are economically more consequence than the elimination of one railroad out of several at these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="10837.892" offset="43454986">Now I -- that is not of course is not a question to be decided essentially by a pool of shippers, but certainly the unanimity of the support from the shippers is pretty persuasive evidence that looking at economic consequences, there was nothing unreasonable in the judgment that the Commission made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="10860.388" offset="43544952">I think, since I have mentioned the shipper testimony, I should say one thing more about it because it -- this shipper testimony on several aspects of the case is rather embarrassing to the anti-trust division and in their reply brief they suggest that the court really shouldn't pay any attention to it because -- well they say that perhaps the shippers were brainwashed by the railroads and they also suggest that they are frightened of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="10890.925" offset="43667101">Well, as to the first question, the first suggestion, I merely observe that there were 200 and -- more than 200 of these shippers and about 39 associations representing shippers who testified, they were cross-examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="10906.764" offset="43730422">The Examiner accepted their evidence as credible and persuasive and there's plenty of evidence in this record that they don't hesitate to litigate and to oppose the railroads when they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="10919.675" offset="43782040">In fact they bitterly opposed the railroads in the first hearing in this case on the question of Milwaukee conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="10926.204" offset="43808162">But there really isn't any basis for the suggestion that the railroads brainwashed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="10930.982" offset="43827284">The suggestion we frightened them rests on, apparently on a footnote citation of an article by a professor in the trade journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="10941.108" offset="43867826">Rather a remarkable attempt to discredit at a large number of witnesses by a rather feeble weapon, I think, but I suggest that the -- that these witnesses deserve consideration and weight as was given to them both by the Examiner and by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="10960.446" offset="43945148">Now there are two other things about the economic consequences of the elimination of competition that will be eliminated here that I think are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="10972.019" offset="43991437">One has been referred to which is the conditions for the Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="10976.115" offset="44007842">And I merely say about that, that while the department attempts to dismiss the Milwaukee as a weak and ineffective competitor, again there is ample testimony in this record from the shippers that the Milwaukee has been, even without the conditions, an effective competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="10996.596" offset="44089762">And there's also evidence that they expect with the conditions as -- that it will be an even more effective competitor, and there's no doubt about the effective -- what those conditions will do to its competitive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="11009.265" offset="44140440">It's true it doesn't have as much money as the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="11012.856" offset="44154755">It doesn't have as big a volume of traffic, isn't as large, but those facts do not mean that the company is an ineffective competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="11026.335" offset="44208671">Indeed if I may take somewhat the same line I took a moment ago, I have often heard the anti-trust division attached great importance to the activities of small competitors on the ground that they make up in hunger, ambition and enterprise for their lack of resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="11046.846" offset="44290800">Well, the Milwaukee here is certainly has been and will be, I think on the basis of the facts, an effective competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="11056.688" offset="44330088">The other thing that I should like to mention before the Court rises is the question of intermodal competition which again as I think has been dismissed by the Department of Justice without a recognition of what the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="11078.578" offset="44417651">Here again, the evidence is there's a great deal of particularized evidence on what trucks are dong in this part of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="11086.518" offset="44449416">There may not be as much truck competition in the northwest as there is in the northern tier as there is elsewhere, but there's enough of it to exert a very direct and heavy pressure on these railroads competitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="11101.424" offset="44509080">We have cited in our brief testimony from some of these shippers, and along this the citations in one place of shippers who said, “The real competition today is not the rate competition is not between the railroads and the other railroads, it's between the trucks and the railroads.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11119.672" offset="44582013">And as far as these agricultural commodities are concerned, the bulk commodities, there's particularized evidence that trucks are moving in increasing quantities grain, agricultural commodities, lumber, paper products, lime, salt, a whole range of bulk products which one time were thought to be immune to truck competition, and of course no one disputes that they are moving -- have been moving large quantities of the merchandise traffic, which is the traffic that the move to the large part into this territory instead of out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11163.982" offset="44759333">The trucks have improved their time schedules as I made the reference to the Milwaukee situation a moment ago, and they're building highways so that their time between the Twin Cities and the West Coast in some instances will be less than that of the railroads today.</text>
            <text syncTime="11180.890" offset="44826937">So that this -- the trucks which also serve these points, not only they serve the points, not only where there are railroads left, but they serve the points where there will be one railroad left and they provide effective and direct competition today which in its strength and vigor is sufficiently compensates for the loss of one railroad at the points where there are several railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="11206.463" offset="44929233">Now, I've taken these things together.</text>
            <text syncTime="11210.224" offset="44944280">I should like to suggest to this point in the argument, I believe it was that, that the -- when the Commission made this balancing -- went through the balancing process in its second report, which is what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="11223.949" offset="44999137">It did not depreciate the value of competition, but as compared with what it did in the first report it engaged in a more thoughtful and detailed analysis of what kind of competition would be left, very important, and what the economic significance to the competition that was eliminated really was.</text>
