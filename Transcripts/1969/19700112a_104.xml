            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Zinn</label>
            <text syncTime="8.706" offset="138219">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.625" offset="149922">This is a federal tax lien case here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.771" offset="182418">It involves the question whether a federal tax lien with respect to a parcel of improved real property, located in Livingston County, Michigan is prior to the interest in that property of subsequent purchases of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.968" offset="247202">The United States acquired its lien in 1950, when it secured a tax court judgment against Thomas Donnelly for some $26,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.050" offset="295581">When that judgment went unpaid, United States acquired a lien under Section 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which appears at page 17 of our brief in the appendix and the lien arose in favor of the United States ?upon all property and rights to property whether real or personal belonging to such person.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.230" offset="416266">In 1945 in this Court's decision in the Glass City Bank case, it was held that the lien of the United States under Section 3670 applies not only to a taxpayer's present property, but also to any after acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.338" offset="488678">To ensure that its lien would be prior to the interest of subsequent purchases and others however, the United States must give due notice of the lien by filing a notice of the lien in accordance with the provisions of Section 3672 of the Internal Revenue Code, which also appear beginning on page 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.092" offset="583764">Section 3672 provides that ?such lien shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the collector; one, in the office in which the filing of such notice is authorized by the law of the State or Territory in which the property subject to the lien is situated, whenever the State or Territory has by law authorized the filing of such notice in an office within the State or Territory; Or Two, in the office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the judicial district in which the property is subject to the lien is situated whenever the State or Territory has not by law authorized the filing of such notice in an office within the State or Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.736" offset="790340">? In short, the question whether the United States is to file locally under Subdivision 1 of Section 3672 A or Subdivision 2 thereof, turns on whether the local law authorizes local filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.418" offset="865050">The Michigan statute which purported to authorize local filing here appears on page 18 of our brief, and with respect to real property, it provides in the pre penultimate line on page 18 that a description of the land upon which a lien is claimed is to be included in the notice of the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.819" offset="974660">The consistent practice of the United States, however, is not to describe any property in a notice of lien but simply to file what is commonly referred to as a blanket notice of lien which merely re-echoes the provisions of Section 3670, names the taxpayer and specifies the amount of his indebtedness to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.286" offset="1096495">In United States against Union Central Life Insurance Company, decided by this Court in 1961, it was held that the Michigan law because of its description requirement did not authorize local filing and that the United States in that case had properly filed its notice of lien in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.268" offset="1196492">Quoting from the opinion of Mr. Justice Black, 368 U.S. at 296, the Michigan law authorizing filing only if a description of the property was placed, was given, placed obstacles to the enforcement of federal tax liens that Congress had not permitted and consequently no state officer was quote ?authorized? for filing within the meaning of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.354" offset="1308818">It was therefore error for the Michigan courts to fail to give priority to the Government's lien here, notice of which had been filed in the District Court in accordance with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.676" offset="1358033">As in the Union Central case, the United States here filed its tax lien in the Eastern District Court for Michigan rather than would be local office of the recorder of deeds for Livingston County and the question is whether its filing was proper under Section 3672 of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.597" offset="1457716">The taxpayer, Thomas Donnelly, acquired the property in question here in 1949 by purchase with his wife as tenants by the entireties and it was held by the entireties until 1960 when Mrs. Donnelly died and by operation of law, Mr. Donnelly became a sole owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.733" offset="1542353">Shortly after Mrs. Donnelly's death, Mr. Donnelly sold the property to Mr. and Mrs. Carlson, who are the real parties in interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.116" offset="1587806">The Carlsons where bona fide purchasers of the property, admittedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.642" offset="1609958">They had an abstract prepared by the Livingston County Abstract Office which covered only the local filings in Livingston County, Michigan, and with specifically accepted covering any filings that were made in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.027" offset="1699506">The Attorneys, who passed upon the marketability of the title for the Carlsons, relied upon the abstract that had been prepared by the Livingston County Abstract Office and accordingly, they did not find notice of the federal tax lien that had been filed in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.888" offset="1778918">After the Carlsons purchased the property in 1960, the United States move to foreclose its tax lien, and the Carlsons objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.319" offset="1820609">They move for summary judgment in the District Court and summary judgment in their favor was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.267" offset="1844433">The Sixth Circuit affirmed on appeal without opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.792" offset="2622568">But there are a number of other reasons why a title searcher in 1960 should have searched the federal files as well as the local files.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.011" offset="2663424">One year after the Youngblood was decided, this Court held in the Glass City Bank case that the United States tax lien under Section 3670 applied to after acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.008" offset="2715355">Now obviously, after acquired property cannot be described in a notice which previously filed, so we think a reasonable lawyer or reasonable title searcher would well have been on notice as to the possibility of liens that federally filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.040" offset="2779512">Moreover, in 1952 as we pointed out in our brief, an article appeared in the Michigan law review which said that lawyers should perhaps even need to check federal filings.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.188" offset="3744162">And more recently in Cipriano against City of Houma, voting rights case, have looked to three factors to determine whether the decision should be retroactive or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.896" offset="3822947">The second factor is whether the purpose of the new rule would be frustrated, if the decision were applied prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.127" offset="3855862">And here, we think it would because as a result of the change in the Michigan law to which Mr. Justice Stewart referred, there will be no other cases probably that govern by Union Central and Union Central will stand by itself as one and only decision having no application outside of its four corners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.091" offset="4539747">The Sixth Circuit, it seems to us has held that no matter what the United States does to file a federal tax lien, whether it would be local or federal, it cannot prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.468" offset="4601292">The court below -- the District Court in addition to relying on its prospectivity argument also found that Union Central was distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.462" offset="4645177">It said that there was an unsuccessful filing attempt in the Union Central case with the local register of deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.264" offset="4680391">That is not the case so far as the opinion of this Court and the record show, although it was stipulated in that case, that the Oakland County register of deeds had a policy of not accepting non-descriptive federal filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.961" offset="4747264">The point the District Court seems to make is that had the United States' attempted to file federally or locally, it would have been accepted by the register of deeds here, and therefore this would have given notice to the Carlsons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.141" offset="4807973">We don't know if that's the case or not because the United States did file a non-descriptive notice in Maniaci and it was held that the subsequent purchases nevertheless prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.984" offset="6235303">So from 1944 on, as far as practitioners were concern in the State of Michigan, the Youngblood case represented the highest interpretation of the validity of the Michigan Recording Act and the Michigan Recording Act designated a local office for the filing of federal tax liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.922" offset="6315029">Now, this Court in its wisdom in the Union Central case in 1961, decided that this particular Michigan Act was invalid as to the facts involved in that case because of that one Clause in the Michigan Act which required the Government to put a description of land in the notice that they where filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.411" offset="6401024">But until this Court made that pronouncement in the end of 1961, as far as practitioner's were concerned in the State of Michigan, notwithstanding a Leonard Law Review article and the few other people that may have had some doubts about the Youngblood case, the Youngblood case was the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.212" offset="8064188">This exception appeared in each and every page of every abstract issued by this Livingston County office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.923" offset="8099088">Now, the Michigan statute that this Court construed in the Union Central case was on the books in the State of Michigan for approximately 36 years before it was repealed in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.425" offset="8169096">At the time of the Union Central case, the Michigan statute had been in the books almost 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.263" offset="8192397">The Youngblood case was the highest pronouncement of law at that time, the time that Carlsons' purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.749" offset="8222386">And as the trial court and as affirmed by the Court of Appeals believed the statute, the Michigan statute, had every appearance of being upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.976" offset="8275257">This Court had a situation before it in the Union Central case where the -- in 1953, the Michigan Attorney General rendered an opinion saying that from that time on, the register of deeds couldn't take federal notices without a legal description.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.992" offset="8347355">And in the Union Central case, it says from the time of that opinion until 1956, which was the repeal date of that Michigan statute, it was construed by this Court, the register of deeds would not accept federal tax lien noticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.077" offset="8411721">And the trial court, and we concur, found that this Court made its interpretation of the 1923 Michigan statute in light of the facts which existed between 1953 and 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.579" offset="8473684">And that this Court did not intend in the Union Central case to go back 30 years and strike out the entire series of transactions and filings in Michigan for a 30-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.783" offset="8526555">At the very most, this Court talked about a three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.015" offset="8547453">The Carlsons' purchase -- the lien in this matter was filed in 1950 at the time before the facts which were referred to in Union Central occurred and the trial court distinguished this case from the Union Central case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.046" offset="8603564">But the trial court went on further with the decision in the Chicot County case and the other decisions of this case indicating that where vested rights are involved that this Court may, in those circumstances, determine that the -- it's decisions will be prospective rather than retrospective as to the effects of transactions which occurred before the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.259" offset="8724459">Now, I grant you the Government argues in this case that the Chicot case and the Rockaway New Supply Company case and the Linkletter case, all dealt with other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.784" offset="8778480">But the premise is there and that if rights become vested that this Court has a right to make such a determination that these rights shall not be affected by a decision, and these decisions should not be retroactive where the affect would be such as it is in this Carlson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.559" offset="8865625">The Government is well able to protect itself in tax lien matters and has shown the ability to protect itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.767" offset="8906480">This Court should keep in mind in deciding whether to make the Union Central case retrospective as far as the Carlsons are concerned, the fact that the tax liens where filed in 1950, the foreclosure was not filed until December 30, 1966, almost four years after Donnelly died during which time the assets of Donnelly, if he had any could of have dissipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.018" offset="9027480">And 16 years, almost 17 years, after the tax lien notices where filed during which time, they were two extensions of Donnelly's liability, one extension which we don't admit that validity of was signed after Donnelly sold this property to the Carlsons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.895" offset="9098951">So in other words, Donnelly in 1961 signed an extension agreement with the Government continuing that liability for another fiver years and he didn't own the property anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.277" offset="9148479">Now, this issue was not litigated in lower court, but it shows the equities of the situation in this matter and the equities are basically what the trial court in the Court of Appeals felt should be considered in whether or not this Court should be retrospective or prospective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.168" offset="9444080">I'm talking about the affect on 40,000 titles in four other states other than the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.440" offset="9469158">Each of the statutes involved in that situation was adopted after the Union Central case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.589" offset="9497684">So if property purchasers, lawyers, title examiners, etcetera, in the four states concern, went to determine the relative effects of their statutes, they have Union Central to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.118" offset="9555884">They don't have a case on the books for 15 years that says just the opposite of the Union Central, which was the case in Michigan with the Youngblood, that on appeal from the decision of the second highest court, deciding that the Michigan had a valid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.590" offset="9621713">Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, these are post Union Central statutes and I say that the people in those states should let the chips fall where they may, but the Government shouldn't use this decision as a way of litigating the validity of the statutes in these four states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.329" offset="10988648">At that time, there was the Circuit Court and an appeal directly to the State Supreme Court, and the decision of the circuit court was not generally made public, unless somebody happen to be familiar with it or come across it in the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.419" offset="11057089">We have not discussed today, the issue that we have raised here in regard to the necessity of recording a tax lien notice, when after acquired property is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.280" offset="11104528">Now, this matter is covered in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.460" offset="11117171">We feel that is an issue that is never been passed upon by this Court and this is that the entireties property which was acquired by Donnelly and his wife in 1949, was not Donnelly's, or for that matter was not Donnelly's for the tax lien notice to attach to until 1960 when Mrs. Donnelly died and the property at that time became that of Donnelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.610" offset="11221765">And we cited in our brief, the Hutchinson case as well as the Nathanson case, and the American National Bank case dealing with law similar to Michigan or the Nathanson case, the Michigan law, all of which says that in an estate by the entireties, neither the husband or the wife individually own an interest in a piece of -- in the entireties property which is capable of standing alone of being levied upon for the tax liability of one spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.361" offset="11368782">The Hutchinson case by the Court of Appeals, as well as the American National Bank case, both indicate that the federal tax lien does not attach to entireties property until the death of one of the spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.354" offset="11448822">It is our position that a clear reading of the Internal Revenue Code Recording Provisions would require the filing of a notice as against after acquired property in a state where such a notice had not been previously filed at the time such property is acquired by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.283" offset="11548505">Now, the Glass City Bank case is my learned colleague indicated, says that a tax lien attaches to after acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.079" offset="11591659">But there is a void as far as the law is concerned, as to what the Government must do to perfect that tax lien against such after acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.840" offset="11646725">The lien is a legal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.099" offset="11663757">The notice of that lien is a notice to the world which perfects that lien as against intervening third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.859" offset="11698761">And in this situation, the Government has said in affect that if Union Central applies to the federal filing of the notice in this case, the 1950, that that notice in 1950 is good in perpetuity to all notices filed in the federal court on forever until those liens are no longer enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.643" offset="11793951">We feel that this is not the law and it is not the intent of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.994" offset="11815372">The Internal Revenue Code says, that notice shall be filed whenever the state has designated a state office and the word whenever means at such time as and I don't think that the Internal Revenue Code has to be construed to mean that a notice filed in the federal court is good forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.184" offset="11892067">I'm not saying that it affects liens that were existence against property, in the existence when the lien was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.240" offset="11920384">But if the state adopts a valid state recording law, it is our contention that the Government must at that time go an comply with that state law as to property which comes into existence after that state law is adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.025" offset="12971447">May it please the Court, just two or three brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.230" offset="12988270">First, here that the respondents are asking that a decision of this Court be applied prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.465" offset="13017213">They point to the fact that the United States filed locally in Wayne County in 1950 and locally in Genesee in Livingston County in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.618" offset="13061831">This is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.428" offset="13069040">The law was confused, but the respondents are the ones that are asking that it'd applied prospectively only, and contrary to what the District Court said on page 56 of the record, the next to last line, it says, prior to that decision referring to this Court's decision in Union Central, there was no indication that such statute would be declared per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.112" offset="13171858">On the contrary, every indication was that the statute would be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.114" offset="13191816">We have outlined previously that it was not just a law review article in 1952 pointing out the problem, Glass City Bank and Youngblood cannot stand together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.003" offset="13231417">That was the decision of this Court, and that should have put on notice, reasonable purchasers of property and others in Michigan.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Zinn</label>
            <text syncTime="3293.710" offset="13278229">Youngblood, decided by the Sixth Circuit in 1944, and holding that a description -- no, and Glass City Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.931" offset="13315114">Because Glass City Bank said that the United States lien applies to after acquired property, and there is no way who describe that for acquired property in a notice because we don't know what that property is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.454" offset="13377181">Respondents seek to support the judgment below on the ground that the United States should have refiled in 1960 after Michigan had passed the Uniform Tax Lien Registration Act in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.521" offset="13449488">With regard to that, I think that the differences between this Court's views and that of the Sixth Circuit are made quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.157" offset="13483969">With reference to the Sixth Circuit's opinion in the Faulk case which has pending on the Government's petition for certiorari in number 844, and the statement of Mr. Justice Black's in the Union Central case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.957" offset="13535169">In order for the United States to re-file, every time a delinquent taxpayer acquires property afterwards it has to follow that taxpayer around and keep tabs on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.760" offset="13582399">Now in the Faulk case which is quoted on page 13 of respondent's brief, the Sixth Circuit said ?some Government scrutiny of the affairs of delinquent taxpayers sufficient to enable it, to know where to properly file notice of lien? seem to have been contemplated by this entire statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.915" offset="13667035">Requiring the Government to investigate the affairs of the delinquent taxpayer to determine to what property the statutory lien attaches and therefore, where to properly file the required notice of lien in no way cuts down on the broad scope of the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.806" offset="13726595">That is not the case and that is to be compared with the statement of Mr. Justice Black, 368 U.S. 294 and ?it seems obvious that this expansive protection for the Government, that is the protection that its lien runs to after acquired property would be greatly reduced if to enforce it, Government agents were compelled to keep aware at all times of all property coming into the hands of its tax delinquents.?</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.774" offset="13838503">The Sixth Circuit has been out of steps since the Maniaci case in 1940. United States filed both locally and federally in that case and it lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.658" offset="13874030">It attempted to file locally in Youngblood and it lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.212" offset="13892211">Union Central is controlling here and there's no basis for a prospective only holding.</text>
