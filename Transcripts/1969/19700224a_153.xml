            <text syncTime="43.619" offset="277817">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.577" offset="293700">The principle issue in these cases is whether or not a guilty plea can be opened up to collateral attack in order to test in evidentiary defense which could have been tested at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.936" offset="359111">These are three habeas corpus petition cases in which the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ordered evidentiary hearings on the petitions of state prisoners who are detained by virtue of their pleas of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.451" offset="425148">The District Courts which initially considered these habeas petitions, declined to order such hearing because the primary allegation of each relator that a coerced confession had been obtained from him was not the direct attack on a guilty plea itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.397" offset="501008">Biased decisions in these cases, the Second Circuit has held that confessions which weren't introduced against a relator nevertheless can be attacked collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.719" offset="554297">I will address myself primarily to the nature of a plea of guilty as precluding a subsequent attack on the admissibility of potential evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.780" offset="594526">Mr. Juviler of the Office of District Attorney of New York County will also discuss this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.386" offset="620962">And in addition to claiming that a coerced confession was used against him, each of these relators makes other allegations on which the Second Circuit has also ordered evidentiary hearings and Mr. Juviler will discuss those allegations as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.854" offset="686791">These three men were all convicted in New York State of serious crimes following their pleas of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.460" offset="717197">All three were represented by counsel, all of them pleaded guilty to substantially reduced charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.397" offset="744991">Richardson satisfied two first degree murder charges by his plea to one charge of murder in the second degree after a plea to murder on the first degree had been rejected in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.141" offset="803924">Dash satisfied indictment charging with robbery in the first degree by pleading guilty to robbery in the second degree after he personally rejected a guilty plea to the higher charge and Williams satisfied an indictment charging robbery and rape for the first degree with his guilty plea to robbery in the second degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.278" offset="1212479">I would like to follow at that thought for a moment there because I think that one of the problems in these cases is that no matter how we look at these petitions and at the Second Circuit decision, no colloquy even the one in Richardson could ever satisfy the issue raised in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.579" offset="1297638">After the judgments of conviction became final in these cases, each of these relators sought collateral relief in New York by coram nobis which is a post-conviction procedure in New York for testing claims which are not apparent in the face of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.234" offset="1360332">Relief was denied in each case without a hearing and the denials were affirmed by the state appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.911" offset="1391052">Then each relator sought federal habeas corpus, claiming essentially that he after his arrest he gave a coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.751" offset="1442356">After the District Courts had dismissed these petitions the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered evidentiary hearings in three separate opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.517" offset="1481435">The Dash case was part of en banc decision, Richardson was decided to the same day and Williams about a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.618" offset="1525844">Basically, the majority opinion held in the Second Circuit that where a claim is made that evidence was illegally obtained and where it is also maintained that the existence and threatened use of that evidence at a trial substantially motivated a plea of guilty, a petitioner is entitled to evidentiary hearing to test his claims -- to test his claims that his confession was coerced that his plea was involuntary, that his plea was substantially motivated by the allegedly coerced confession that hold the whole range of allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.254" offset="1692400">We think that in rendering these decisions, the Court of Appeals has seriously misinterpreted the significance of a plea of guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.099" offset="6595793">They never regard it as a viable alternative and yet it seems, it would seem that the right to go to trial is really what is at issue in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.386" offset="6640933">Now, as I said briefly before, before the Jackson decision, the problem in Jackson was at the same jury passed on the question of guilt or innocence and on the question of the voluntariness of a confession and that procedure was upheld by this Court in 1953 in Stein against New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.234" offset="6716270">Since the Jackson decision applies to cases which had already been tried prior to June 22, 1964, the Second Circuit concluded that it applied also to cases in which there was no trial prior to 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.717" offset="6774262">But clearly, Jackson does not apply where there never was a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.797" offset="6798608">The problem arising from a case that had already been tried before 1964 is that a confession that the jury had already heard might have been coerced and therefore the conviction, that is the jury's verdict, would've been based on the coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.932" offset="6863078">And so now, we have to hold evidentiary hearings to determine whether or not that was the case, but as we've said here the convictions aren't based on confessions or any other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.625" offset="6917831">Now, the Second Circuit also found that these relators couldn't be deemed to had entered voluntary pleas of guilty if their pleas were substantially motivated by coerced confessions, the validity of which for practical purposes they were unable to contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.798" offset="6982614">But for this assertion to have any meaning it would have to be alleged factually that the pre-Jackson procedure in some way actually motivated the plea of guilty and counsel's advice to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.686" offset="7038098">In other words, the Stein procedure as a matter of law was so bad that it even prompted pleas of guilty, innocent man to plead guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2624.156" offset="10599946">First, that of Mr. Richardson because he attempts in a way to get under this rubric and say that his attorney just completely failed to protect him against the use of a coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.278" offset="10676433">When Mr. Richardson pleaded guilty, the colloquy situs precluded the dangers suggested in your question, Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.549" offset="10721573">As reflected on pages 90 and 91 of the appendix, the Court inquiry of Mr. Richardson, “Did you discuss this case fully with Mr. McCooe and Mr. Rosner,” those was his assigned counsel, “Yes sir, I did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.372" offset="10784893">“Did you understand them when you spoke to them about your case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.187" offset="10924074">“Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.070" offset="10923969">The Court then established that there were no threats made to induce the plea and no promises from a long list of public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.864" offset="10923865">Now, the Court inquires, “Did you commit this crime?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.577" offset="10923760">“Now, did you on or about March 24, 1963 in the County of New York willfully and feloniously strike Rosalie Smith with a knife there by causing her death?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.865" offset="10930866">If we have a danger of innocent man pleading guilty then the way to attack that is in the colloquy of pleading to protect the pleading procedure as has been suggested in the Bargain case by this Court and in the McCarthy case interpreting Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, but in neither of those cases was there one bit of a suggestion that this colloquy, this protection of the defendant must include any inquiry whatsoever from the Court as to the admissibility of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.162" offset="11096064">With respect to the other allegation in these petitions which include ineffective assistance of counsel and a judicial threat to induce a plea, our basic position is that the Court of Appeals deprived the District Court of a sound discretion when it overruled the denial of these allegations without a hearing and if there is to be no finality in criminal cases, no end to litigation after a conviction, then there should be no end to the sound discretion of the District Courts who are in the front lines and their colleagues in the state courts reviewing post-conviction claims for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.728" offset="11298252">It is established that if a claim in post-conviction proceedings is vague, conclusory or palpably incredible then it can be denied without a hearing and that was overlooked by the Court of Appeals in these three cases without dwelling at too great length on the specific facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.661" offset="11389994">Mr. Richardson who claims ineffective assistance in counsel in objecting to this coerced confession, in his petition in the District Court merely made conclusory allegations at pages A78 and A82 and surely there is nothing stated there which overcomes the colloquy which I read to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.888" offset="11498872">The Court of Appeals did not say otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.898" offset="11510993">They didn't order a hearing on the petition for habeas corpus filed in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.996" offset="11535339">They ordered a hearing on a supplementary affidavit that was attached to the appellate brief in the Second Circuit in complete disregard for the orderly procedures of federal habeas corpus, and this was over the objection of the state which we reassert in this Court that this matter in the supplementary affidavit was not presented to the District Court and it was not presented to the state courts and therefore the relator had not exhausted his available state remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2982.382" offset="12032920">Not only that, but the supplementary affidavit is contradicted by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.901" offset="12050996">It's contradicted by the pleading minutes and there is no explanation why Mr. Richardson after allegedly having been told by his attorney that he could test his confession by a writ of habeas corpus, waited for a minimum of two-and-a-half years before attempting to do so in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.773" offset="12162487">Mr. Dash was granted an evidentiary hearing by the Second Circuit on an allegation that when he appeared in Court for pleading, the judge threatened him off the record with the maximum sentence if he went to trial and was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.781" offset="12234480">Now, if that were true, it would establish a ground in New York State for a hearing -- for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.250" offset="12264364">New York is very, very careful to preclude judicial threats, but 11 New York State judges before the District Court passed on that petition and said there is not enough substance here for a hearing that included the coram nobis court, five judges of the appellate division and five of the seven judges of the New York Court of Appeals and this was a sound exercise of discretion because the defendant had waited for more than three years before he brought this claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.310" offset="12948564">The Williams petition was held sufficient for a hearing on a claim which is quite remarkable at page 50 in the footnote to this habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.897" offset="13010944">It's introduced by the information that six years after the plea of guilty, Mr. Williams' assigned counsel was disbarred for overzealousness in a divorce case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.067" offset="13063607">Now, when that disbarment notice was published, this petition, this claim was raised in the state court and then in the federal court that Mr. Davidson had just prior to the plea advised the relator that the charge to which the D.A. was allowing to plea was a misdemeanor not a felony and that relator did not discover the fact until sentenced on the felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.634" offset="13165902">Now, he was sentence to seven-and-a-half to 15 years for robbery in the second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.499" offset="13185337">It is palpably incredible that he would knowing at sentencing discovering then that this was not a misdemeanor, wait for six years before informing us as to this advice from counsel, particularly a man who was no stranger to the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.102" offset="13259734">The alibi claim on which the Second Circuit appears independently to have ordered an evidentiary hearing is also vague and palpably incredible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.017" offset="13303411">This claim is that Mr. Williams told his attorney that he had an alibi, that he was out of the jurisdiction and the attorney disregarded this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.472" offset="13349282">There is no statement as to where Mr. Williams was, there is no corroborating affidavit and Williams waited in this instance eight years before he first informed any one of this alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.459" offset="13401213">Now, if this attorney had suggested a trial on such an alibi then Mr. Williams would be here saying that the attorney was incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.949" offset="13447189">What is the hearing going to be into in the Williams case on this alibi?</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.251" offset="13468400">What is the purpose of this hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.396" offset="13480939">And I think these three petitions with their -- these additional allegations on which hearings have been ordered raise a very serious question in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.909" offset="13527019">How much are we going to ponder over past cases when the administration of criminal justice is currently in crisis?</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.399" offset="13568920">The wolf is at the door and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has said that we have to go poking in the chest in the attic to see whether there something amiss there and I think that the ordering of hearings on these allegations weakens and deprecates the great writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.357" offset="13712802">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.861" offset="13726804">There are two primary things that I would like to address myself to because I feel that there has been either misstatement or confusion about first of all, the facts in the case and secondly, just precisely what the court below did do in each of these cases and what it did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.638" offset="13813948">First and foremost, I think that it is clear that Second Circuit did not announce a new rule of law in any of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.621" offset="13853863">It merely reinterpreted and severely limited one of its own cases, United States against ex rel. Glenn against McMann.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.410" offset="13893047">Now, this was a very long overdue step because the Glenn decision was at odds with decisions in this Court as well as with the decisions in the Courts of Appeal of at least five other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.072" offset="13951666">Secondly, the court below in limiting this Glenn decision acknowledged that under certain circumstances, the existence of a coerced confession could coerce a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.431" offset="14009135">The surprising thing about this recognition is that it came so late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.133" offset="14035884">But it cannot be stressed enough that the Second Circuit did not hold that the bare allegation that a confession was coerced entitles a habeas petitioner either to a hearing or to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.861" offset="14098787">A certain specified cause an effect relationship has to be alleged and has to be proved and the cause an effect relationship varies in each one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.190" offset="14160123">In the Richardson case and to an extent in the Williams case, the reason that the defendant was prevented from raising his confession claim at trial was because he was represented by counsel who was incompetent or negligent and refused to lift a finger to help him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.076" offset="14235669">According to the allegations, now we're on the pleadings here, and this is not a question of what has been proved, these are un-controverted allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.629" offset="14285928">In the Dash case, the cause an effect relationship between the coerced confession and the guilty plea was that counsel was unable to do anything meaningful to prevent the coerced confession from being used to convict the defendant at trial and the reason for this was Jackson against Denno or Stein against New York, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.729" offset="14394284">The third thing that I would like to point out is that the decisions below do not automatically call into question the validity of all guilty pleas no matter how painstaking and how complete the colloquy at pleading has been or despite the fact that the defendant has been represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.376" offset="14476831">The Second Circuit merely held I think virtually every other Court in the country that in certain instances where you have off the record or allegations of off the record facts in a petition even a full colloquy at pleading and even representation by counsel do not create an irrebuttable presumption of voluntariness of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.740" offset="14582366">Moreover, the Second Circuit recognized that both these factors, the completeness of the colloquy and representation by counsel are entitled to great weight in the ultimate assessment of the voluntaries of the plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="4128.459" offset="16617200">And if you didn't present it at trial can we say that under those circumstances there has been a waiver because you have failed to present the claim in an acceptable state procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="7135.513" offset="28645439">This fingerprint record merely shows that two persons with the name William McKinley or Williams McKinley or McKinley Williams were in custody, one in Ohio and the other in New York and it expressly states that there are no fingerprint cards to support this statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="7223.012" offset="28995375">He admits that he had blood on his clothing and he admits that these people who died were his relatives and he further acknowledges that he gave the police a false alibi prior to the initiation of the coercive tactics which he now alleges, and he attributes this false alibi to his desire to avoid getting these three men in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="7261.288" offset="29148557">Further, Mr. Richardson acknowledges that he did have two conferences although they were brief with his attorney respecting the admissibility of his confession and the attorney came to a reasoned decision that it would be best or that it was not -- he was not going to succeed if he attempted to keep it out of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7282.676" offset="29234030">The only defense tendered to any court at any stage of the litigation against Mr. Richardson, is that in his District Court habeas corpus petitions which is surely a very weak foundation for a defense to a first degree murder charge.</text>
