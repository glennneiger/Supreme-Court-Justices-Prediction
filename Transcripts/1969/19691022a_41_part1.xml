            <text syncTime="513.934" offset="2159156">And just as constantly, it pledged to these Indian tribes that if they would give up their ancestral homes in the Southern States that the lands to be ceded to them west of the Mississippi would never be embraced in any state or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.768" offset="2246405">Now the Southern Indians did move west of the Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.517" offset="2505435">That pledge was not only reflected in the negotiations leading up to the treaties, it was reflected in the treaties themselves and as they further assurance, the United States gave to the Southern Tribes and it gave this to no other tribe in the United States, a fee simple title to the lands west of the Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="1018.828" offset="4178735">Indeed the treaty with the Choctaws specifically provided, the Article 24, that if any reasonable doubt existed, it must be construed most favorably to the Choctaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.970" offset="4227218">So speaking generically now as the Indian Tribes, we say this, “How shall down the Arkansas be construed?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.313" offset="4260655">Well the Court must say it must construed most favorably to the Indian Tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.644" offset="4441945">Yes and I think that Your Honor reached the real crux of this case by that inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.550" offset="4497533">When the United States held territorial lands, it held the beds on navigable rivers for the benefit of a future state, but the United States during territorial status had full authority to convey the river bed for purposes that were appropriate to the objects for which it held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.222" offset="4600247">There have been any number of decisions on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.356" offset="4612786">So then we -- this point comes up, well why would the United States have held this bed back in 1820?</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.520" offset="4653432">What would it did -- wanted to hold the bed of the Arkansas, give everything all around it but withhold, not the whole Arkansas but just the navigable portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.333" offset="4704737">Would it be holding it for a future state? They promised the Indians time after time that no -- that this area would never be embraced in any state or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.099" offset="4751757">They not only promised it to them, they put it in their treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.448" offset="4773177">They therefore could not have been in 1820, contemplating that they were reserving the navigable portion of the Arkansas for the benefit of a future state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.233" offset="4840260">Well, would it have been reserving it for the minerals that were in it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.407" offset="4856978">It gave the Indian Tribes all the minerals that lay above the navigable portion, why would it hold it for the navigable portion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.220" offset="4892296">Why would it want the ablest beds in 1820?</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.472" offset="5461243">My time is rather brief and -- but I should like to call the Court's attention to the reliance on the three cases that Oklahoma relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.036" offset="5495515">Two of them were decisions on the Supreme Court of Oklahoma and in none of these decisions, I will say were the Indian Tribes represented or was the Government represented on behalf of the Indian Tribes in any of these case nor were these treaties brought to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.415" offset="5569076">The two Oklahoma decisions are predicated upon the belief of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma and the stated belief of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma that the bed of the river was being held for the benefit of a future state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.951" offset="5627173">And if it was the intention of the United States and the Indian Tribes in the early 1800's that this area would never be embraced in any state, then the premise upon which the decisions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma are bottomed are paux.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.230" offset="5704286">Now, there is one case, and counsel for Oklahoma must comment on it at great length and he must try to show that it is related to the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.816" offset="5750680">I challenge him that he will not be able to do so and that is the Holt State -- United States versus Holt State Bank which is a decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.851" offset="5786728">Holt State Bank arose in Minnesota when the Chippewas ceded their aboriginal lands to the United States, reserving to themselves a right of occupancy within a certain area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.008" offset="5879411">Now, it's important -- now later, they did in their session and the Chippewas were the granting party, they were the moving party and that distinguishes and interdicts the application of Holt State Bank to this case because in our case, the United States was the granting party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.673" offset="5982020">Now, in Holt State Bank, this Court said of the Chippewas, if they had wanted to keep the bed of Mud Lake, they should have made some provision for it in their cession to the United States, but when the teaching of Holt versus State -- the United States versus Holt State Bank is applied to the facts in our case, then we submit this Court would have said had the United States being the granting party wanted to reserve the bed of the Arkansas River, then it should have accepted it from its grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.707" offset="6150248">Now, we say to the Court, that there was no grant moving from the United States to the Chippewas in Holt State Bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.167" offset="6584090">This Court said in the last page of its decision in Holt State Bank or rather with the minute that's left of me, most of the reservations said this Court in Holt State Bank, including the part -- the vicinity of Mud Lake was relinquished and ceded by the Chippewas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.057" offset="6675623">The session became effective through the President's approval, marks the board in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.780" offset="6710523">And in the last page of the Court's decision, this Court said, “The reservation came into being through a succession of treaties with the Chippewas whereby they ceded to the United States for aboriginal right of occupancy to the surrounding lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.351" offset="6772799">There was no formal setting apart of what was not ceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.973" offset="6791293">The effect of what was done in a general way, the effect of what was done was to reserve in a general way for the continued occupation of the Indians what remained of their aboriginal territory thus again be known and recognized as a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.070" offset="6859630">Now that fact is the distinguishing fact which interdicts the application of Holt State Bank to this case, but if the Court were applying the rule, the teachings in Holt State Bank to the facts in this case, it would have said this I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.101" offset="6959731">The United States was the granting party and had it wanted to reserve the bed of the Arkansas River, the navigable portion of the Arkansas River, it should have done so in its grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.936" offset="7019081">The fact that it agreed with the Indians that this area would never be embraced with any future state or territory evinced the intent to depart from the established purpose of reserving the beds of navigable streams for the benefit of future states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.753" offset="7110405">We respectfully submit that the United States had nothing, but a navigation easement on the Arkansas when Oklahoma became a state and Oklahoma therefore took no interest in the bed in the Arkansas River by being -- by a reason of it being admitted to the state, to the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.335" offset="7356688">All that I would say to that question very briefly is one, we have received the first patent of these lands in 1838, signed by President Van Buren and in that we are given the land dents down the Canadian River on the North to a junction with the Arkansas River and dents down the main channel of the Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.474" offset="7517288">And that is all we claim as the thalweg of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.960" offset="7543202">In that connection I might briefly show this map to Your Honors and that if you will notice between the 95th and 96th parallel on the lands marked to the Cherokees, I don't know what that section is, that the Arkansas River runs completely through the land of the Cherokees, i.e. it's bordered on both sides by the grant through the Cherokees in the Treaty of New Echota later -- of 1835 in the later patent, 1838.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.645" offset="7734000">It's after it comes to that line that there's a border between the Cherokees and the Choctaw.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.603" offset="8253733">We have reproduced an exact reproduction of Royce's map which indicates merely a change in the color of the line for the river on that part of the Arkansas where the Cherokee lands meets the Arkansas at the 95th parallel, approximately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.784" offset="8402526">In other words, that's a mere color, the line of the river, their map would indicate that the -- and I just don't want the Court mislead that the dark line would be the boundary of the grant for the Cherokee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.048" offset="8519555">I would like briefly to give a little background of the Cherokee Nation that prior to the revolution, its principal lands were North Carolina, Virginia and Georgia that consisted approximately some 80 million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.314" offset="8592593">They had absolute dominion over this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.854" offset="8606804">Following the revolution, there was a Treaty of Hopewell entered into in 1785 where the Cherokees then swore allegiance to the U.S. and the U.S. Government in turn agreed to protect the tribe and recognize its sovereignty to all of those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.210" offset="8716204">Not too long after that that the conflict begun between the white settlers and the Cherokees and the Choctaws and the Chickasaws and the Creeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.897" offset="8758941">The Southern Indians had became five civilized tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.991" offset="8779316">They were forced from Virgin -- North Carolina, Virginia, principally into Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.771" offset="8802408">At that time Georgia passed laws in effect providing that they could enjoy no rights that if any man or white man was found upon their land, that he -- that they had to have permission of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.264" offset="8864475">Following this Marshall opinion in Worcester came down in which he clearly recognized the sovereign of the tribe set aside although Georgia heeded and they find in -- with somewhat certainty saying that the Cherokees had sovereignty over their tribal lands, that they had control of the traffic over the Tennessee River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.028" offset="8995506">That they enjoyed all the rights of the river that the white man would have to get their permission in effect to use the river and the -- even in face of the Court's recognition of these rights and certainly the Cherokees were not going to accept less if they went west than what they had in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.127" offset="9087875">And even after Marshall spoke, the courts and the executive continued complete harassment of all these Southern Indian Tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.476" offset="9149315">First, the Cherokees moved to Arkansas in 1870 which became known as the old settlers and that was in exchange of land to move to Arkansas, but Arkansas was not satisfied with the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.160" offset="9240012">There was again the conflict between the whites and the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.727" offset="9266239">So following that, there was a treaty executed in 1828 between the Cherokees and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.763" offset="9298422">After the Arkansas whites had again insisted that they move further west and this treaty in effect without detail moved the old settlers into Arkansas along the old settler Cherokees into the lands west of Arkansas which became Indian Territory along with the other Indians that were further east in Georgia and generally the treaty granted the same rights, all of these treaties of 1817 and 1828 and 1825.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.486" offset="9477308">It provided that this land was to be as Mr. Kile has said, “Their permanent home, it was never to be encroached upon by any territory or state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.427" offset="9525060">It granted further and which one -- I think one Indian Commissioner in which -- in their speeches to Cherokees trying to get them to sign the Treaty of New Echota which shortly followed the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit which was a treaty for the Choctaw that this was an awful, that they were getting fee simple title and as he expressed it, they were getting white man's title for the first time and this was the only title ever issued to any Indians and they were confined to the five civilized tribes that ultimately settled in Indian Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.874" offset="9694856">The rest of the title were aboriginal titles which gave them the right of reservation and occupancy and so forth and now they could be given a clear promise of how they could be given a more complete jurisdiction over their territory is beyond me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.102" offset="9783777">And they agreed to possess to the Cherokees some 7,000 acres of land within this grant, I mean 7 million, excuse me, which show -- they started out with 80, it's not in exactly an excessive grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.170" offset="9872071">They also agreed by the treaties to issue the patent I have previously referred to, the patent granted this land in fee simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.453" offset="9925151">They gave them white man's title and it was described by meats and bounds and encompassed a whole grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.219" offset="9972276">Certainly the United States didn't intend to exclude a meandering stream running through this grant unless they had chosen to say so and this people knew how to draft instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.123" offset="10051897">They excluded the Fort Gibson, they excluded post roads, they excluded certain plains that would be available to all Indian Tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2805.134" offset="11323956">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.255" offset="11340361">I hesitate to detain the Court much longer in these cases arguing on the same side but perhaps I can perform some service to the Court as an amicus curiae if I attempt to very briefly summarize and perhaps simplify the issues as we see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.796" offset="11434506">The first fact which we would stress in this case is that here we have clear cut conveyances of large tracts of lands to these three Indian tribes, Choctaws and the Chickasaws, together with Cherokees separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.565" offset="11505664">The sequence of those grants seems to us of no great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.779" offset="11530533">It happens that from the point of view of the treaties the Choctaws come first and the Cherokee is second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.851" offset="11562820">From the point of view of the patents, it's the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.171" offset="11584031">The important thing however is that there were grants in fee simple to these tribes of very large tracts adjacent one to the other and between them, entirely surrounding and encompassing the navigable portion of the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.834" offset="11662712">But the fact that there's a conveyance in fee simple immediately distinguishes the Holt State Bank case which is invoked by the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.115" offset="11699806">There, there was no conveyance whatever nor was there even a setting aside of the portion of the aboriginal lands of the Chippewas which was reserved to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.584" offset="11749752">Those reserved lands, well lands which under the decisions of this Court, the United States always owned in -- always had the title to, the Indians simply had a right of occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.617" offset="11805863">Therefore the United States always owned the beds of the navigable rivers and of the Mud Lake which was at issue in the Holt State Bank case and there was no act, no transaction which ever changed that situation, whereas here, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.983" offset="11879320">The United States cedes these tracts to the Indian tribes and the burden it seems to us is on the other side to show why the beds of the river did not go with the grants.</text>
