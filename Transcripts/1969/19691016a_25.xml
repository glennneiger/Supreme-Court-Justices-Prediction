            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="64.662" offset="362036">Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.680" offset="378128">The principal question in these consolidated cases which are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is one of the Secretary of Agriculture has authority under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 to include in note marketing orders a provision for the payment of a premium to farmers who are located close to the center of the milk market.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.782" offset="494529">More specifically, the case involves the validity of the so-called “farm differential payments in the Boston Rhode Island Milk Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.416" offset="537057">Under which farmers whose farms are located within 40 miles of the center of the market are paid a differential over and above it the blended price of all farmers receive are 46 cents per 100 pounds of milk which is the equivalent of one cent a quart.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.573" offset="613648">There's also a provision in the order which provide for payment of 23 cents a 100 pounds for farmers who are located in the next area 40 to in effect, 40 to 80 miles from the center of the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.304" offset="660564">But that involves a very small percentage of the differentials involved in under the order and I therefore sure limit my discussion because its considerations of equally applicable to the 46 cent differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.708" offset="722213">The present case brought as a class action is by farmers in Vermont who are located beyond the area covered by these differentials and therefore under the order and not eligible for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.959" offset="783235">The District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case held with the statute does not authorized these particular differentials and enjoined the enforcement and payment of the differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.077" offset="835688">In so ruling of the Court appeals relied squarely on an earlier case which I shall discuss called Blair against Freeman which it struck down a similar differential in a New York-New Jersey Milk Marketing Order and I'd also say that the outset that these two decisions of the Court of Appeals saying the Secretary has no authority to include this differentials contrary to a decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in 1939, 30 years ago which specifically held these particular differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.484" offset="977272">Now, to put these statutory issues in the appropriate frame of reference, first, I just very briefly like it, refresh the Court on what I'm sure is already familiar to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.212" offset="1020217">The peculiarities of the way in which milk is sold in the problems that require this kind of legislation, and then I'd like to sketch the legislative history of full statutes involved and finally to describe the administrative background of this order and its predecessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.306" offset="1088554">We start with the fact of course, that milk basically has two uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.273" offset="1108511">The use of milk as fluid milk for drinking purposes which is known as Class I use and then the use of other milk for manufactured purposes, butter, cheese, ice cream which is known as Class II purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.286" offset="1168488">The demand for so-called fluid milk, milk for drinking is relatively static throughout the whole year.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.880" offset="1198895">But unfortunately for the milk industry, the production of the cows is not static.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.117" offset="1219793">The cows produce more milk in the spring and the summer than they do in the fall and the winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.702" offset="1246229">So, this means in order to meet the uniform demand for class milk, one milk throughout the year, it is necessary to add sufficient cows to produce that amount during the winter months. When they're not producing as much and accordingly, the result is in the spring and summer months, there is a surplus of milk production.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.738" offset="1330343">Milk of course is a highly perishable commodity and the result is that milk that is produced of the great distance from the market cannot compete with locally produced milk for the Class I use.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.405" offset="1381021">Although of course, it can compete the Class II use.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.110" offset="1391783">That is in the Boston market, fresh milk from Wisconsin cannot compete with Massachusetts' milk, but obviously manufactured cheese from Wisconsin easily competes with manufactured cheese from the Massachusetts area.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.097" offset="1451760">Now traditionally, milk is which is used for Class I purposes has commanded a substantially higher price in the market than milk that is used for Class II purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.324" offset="1500662">Now, the result of this combination of fact, this has been that without any regulation drastic and devastating cut throat competition developed among the farmers to try to get their milk sold for the Class I use which would yield them a higher amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.109" offset="1575790">The dairies for example would play different farmers off against each other driving the prices down.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.293" offset="1600554">And as a result by the time of the depression in the earlier 1930's, the milk prices had been drastically reduced and in some instance, farmers -- where farmers were forced to sell milk at less than their cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.299" offset="1656560">Now, in order to stabilize this completely disorganized milk market, two purposes were achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.677" offset="1690102">First, it was important to raise the price of milk and secondly, it was important to avoid the destructive competition among farmers to try to get access to this Class I market.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.229" offset="1740257">And the Secretary in the Boston area has followed the same practice that he has followed in most other areas. He employs a system of so-called Market Pooling.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.970" offset="1783202">Under which, the amount each farmer receives for his milk doe not depend upon the particular use that that farmer's milk is put.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.378" offset="1820923">He gets the same price whether or not his milk is use all for Class I purposes, all for Class II purposes, or in some blend.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.259" offset="1856449">The way this is done is by the use of a so-called blended price.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.811" offset="1878601">Under which, the Secretary of Agriculture sets minimum prices for Class I and Class II milk, then determines how or for what purposes the milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.176" offset="1920084">All the milk sold in the market has been used and on this basis calculates the total value of the milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.903" offset="1942967">Then in effect device this by the total volume and ends up with a blended price with each farmer's to receive and by definition of this price, of course, is less than the Class I price and there something more than the Class II price.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.898" offset="2002944">Now, the particular milk dealers, the dairies, the manufactures who are in the statute to call handlers, what happens to them is if a particular dealer sells of more milk in the --</text>

            <text syncTime="489.923" offset="2063026">I'll just add some if they're in explained, just take me one minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.586" offset="2073684">If the particular deal or sales more of his milk for Class I use which means he would under this calculation receive more than he has to pay his dairies, he in effect pays the excess into this producer's settlement fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.415" offset="2129063">Conversely, if more of the milk is use to Class II purposes so that he would not get enough on this calculation to pay his farmers what they're entitled to, he draws on this producer settlement fund, and the result is everyone gets the same price.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.991" offset="2211297">I want to make one thing very clear that in determining the blended price pay to all farmers under the statute, these differentials are deducted before this is calculated that is out of the pool which is divided among the all farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.816" offset="2274617">There is first pay out of various of statutory differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.728" offset="2286320">And that of course is why we have this case because the effect of taking out the 46 cent nearby farm differential in the Boston milk market is to reduce by 12 cents, the blended price that is paid to all the farmers.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="561.578" offset="2349641">The differentials come off the top so to speak?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="563.542" stopTime="640.559">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="564.291" offset="2360508">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.447" offset="2365210">They come off the top and then what is left is divided up and the theme of my argument will be that that precisely would Congress intended the scheme to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.701" offset="2398124">Now, these farm location differentials had their origins a long time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.966" offset="2423202">In the marketing practices at the 1920's, the mid 1920's, long before, there was any federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.361" offset="2456848">But that period under contracts that the various of the dairies had with cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.774" offset="2482448">Farmers, whose farms were located close to the Boston area, received the greater amount with their milk than farmers whose farms were located distance away.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.019" offset="2527483">And when I say a greater amount and I will keep referring to the greater amount, I want to stress one thing because this is -- there's a challenge by our opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.466" offset="2561233">This was an amount that exceeded the difference in the cost of transportation between bringing milk in from the distance and from nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.840" offset="2602715">The indications are that these men received roughly a dollar more for 100 pounds which again in a very rough estimate was very close to the 46 cents that they now receive under the Boston --</text>

            <text syncTime="644.371" offset="2680874">They are numbered Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.058" offset="2687561">One of them was the fact of course that the farmers located close to the market would traditionally able to sell more of their milk at the Class I use which produced the higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.135" offset="2739911">In addition to that, the farmers who are close in over the years had been able to make their milk production more even which was of advantage to the handlers to the dairies and then in the fact --</text>

            <text syncTime="670.188" offset="2784110">Why could they do that just because of their geographical location?</text>

            <text syncTime="674.657" offset="2801977">Well, its not that its not so much of the geographical locate, just developed over the years that they found that in order to do business with the handlers who is selling the most of the milk for Class I uses, it was important to continue -- for their relationship that they have an even production.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="689.888" offset="2862895">But you can't and how the cows know that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="693.461" offset="2877210">Oh, well this entails them apparently in very involved farming practices through the use of artificial insemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.161" offset="2912005">They are able at some cost to spread the milk production over.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.334" offset="2936665">The expression they use is the cows of freshened, and apparently, the cows of freshened some of them in a way that they produced their milk in the fall and in the winter rather than in the spring and summer, and that is the technique they use.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.130" offset="2991940">Now, there's another advantage of course to the producers of having this relationship with the nearby farmers which is that these men were available in the event of an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.937" offset="3031124">That is if sudden those days if late in the day, they suddenly discovered they needed more milk, they could just send a truck out and get this milk more easily, then if they have to go a great distance away when we didn't have modern methods of refrigeration, and also of course in bad weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.460" offset="3089220">If you had a very bad snow storm in the area, it would be much better to have the source of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.687" offset="3118164">Now, when Congress passed the Agriculture Adjustment Act in 1933, very early in the administration of this Act, the Secretary issued a so-called license to the Boston border.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.725" offset="3170304">This was the predecessor to the present order type of arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.146" offset="3187963">And under this license, the license continued the previous advantage that the nearby farmers had enjoyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.237" offset="3220355">That is the nearby farmers got more for their milk than the distant farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.197" offset="3236133">To be sure, it was not in the present form of the differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.321" offset="3248671">It was not paying them a certain amount over and above the regular price.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.473" offset="3265285">It was, however, reflected a high up price paid for milk from the nearby farm is then was paid for the distant farm farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.333" offset="3304678">Two years later from reasons unrelated to the differentially, Boston license was invalidated by a District Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.142" offset="3339891">Partly as a result of this Court's decision in the Schechter case, Congress in 1935 amended the Agriculture Adjustment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.923" offset="3383045">The Amendment added the identical language it is now in Section 8c (5) which I'll come to in a couple of minutes dealing with milk marketing orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.144" offset="3427976">And in making these amendments, the committee report stated that the provisions dealing with milk marketing and distribution and I quote, “Follow the methods employed by cooperative associations of producers prior to the enactment of the Agricultural Adjustment Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="851.317" offset="3508642">Now shortly thereafter, a new order was issued for Boston in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.364" offset="3536854">This order for the first time specifically provided for higher prices to any farmer whose farm is located within 40 miles of the state house of Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.663" offset="3581994">Again, it provided of them not for the mechanism of differential a premium to this nearby for farmers of approximately 46 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.261" offset="3616371">This was done by providing that these nearby farmers want to receive the Class I price rather than the somewhat low of branded -- blended price.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.910" offset="3651062">This order remain in effect for only six months when another District Court in Massachusetts upheld the amended statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.981" offset="3683244">The Secretary then suspended the order and the order remained suspended until Congress had passed the Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.489" offset="3725354">That act utilized and bought in the identical language dealing with milk marketing orders that had been under the 1935 amendments to the triple Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.668" offset="3766000">But in addition to this, there was a specific provision in the 1937 Act Section 4 that stated, that it expressly ratified, legalized and confirmed all existing licenses market orders and provisions that had been issued under the Agriculture Adjustment Act and its amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.662" offset="3842069">The Secretary reinstated the farm location differential in the Boston milk marketing order in 1937 and this time, for the first instance, explicitly provided for the 46-cent and then the 23-cent differential depending upon the distance from Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.920" offset="3923048">And since that time, since 1937, every milk marketing order, the Secretary has issued for this New England area has included similar differentials both the amount of 46 cents and the 40 miles within the center of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.939" offset="3979160">This included 1949 marketing orders for Springfield and Wister, 1958 when he passed/adopted an order for southeast to New England consisting of Rhode Island and Southern Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.573" offset="4033703">And finally, in 1964 when after extensive hearings, the Secretary consolidated before previous orders for this area into the present order.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.479" offset="4081246">And I would just like to quote three sentences which we set forth at our brief on pages 16 to 18 in which the Secretary explained why in 1964, he was reject in both proposals to eliminate the differential and proposals on the other side of the differential should be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.839" offset="4150732">He said as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.620" offset="4157837">Such farm location differentials have been in effect under the several New England orders since the inception of the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.260" offset="4188453">The differentials were adopted to reflect in the pricing structure of the orders, historical price relationships by location which prevailed in these markets.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="1039.015" offset="4259401">It was found that customarily somewhat higher values, above those which normally reflect the transportation costs, attached to milk produced near the principle consumption centers as compare to the market value of milk produced in a more distant areas of the milk shade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.848" offset="4326797">So, if I may just very briefly recapitulate what I think we have before us is the following. First, since before the time of federal regulation, farmers located close to the Boston and New England milk marketing areas have always received more for their milk over above the transportation differential than farmers located further away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.686" offset="4422092">Secondly, that when Congress in 1937 passed the Agricultural Marketing Adjustment Agreement Act, it ratified confirmed and legalized all previous licenses, orders and provisions which of course, included the nearby differential provisions of the Boston orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.711" offset="4502235">Just in passing, the Court of Appeals discounted this and said, it believed that all of that provision was intended to do is to avoid a lapse under the statute, and we have explained in our brief while we think that while that was one of the purposes, the legislative history also indicates that was further intended to approve and confirmed and ratify everything that had been done before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.882" offset="4586872">I now like to turn to the statutory provisions involve in the case which we think determine the in control or legality of the farm location differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.712" offset="4626265">They're set out at the bottom of pages 2 to 4 of our brief and it begins the statutes speaks of milk and its products terms and conditions or orders it says in the case of milk and its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.731" offset="4670255">Orders pursuant to this section shall contain one or more of the following terms and conditions and accept this provide else when no others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.611" offset="4697840">And then over at the bottom of page 3, it should to provide -- milk orders may provide for the payment to all producers and associations of producers, delivering milk to all handlers of uniform prices for all milk so delivered, irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.142" offset="4783940">And then it goes on it says, subject only to adjustments for volume, market and production differentials customarily applied by the handlers subject to such order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.419" offset="4829080">Now, the Court of Appeals found that these orders were beyond the Secretary's authority for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.683" offset="4854053">First, they apparently believe that the irrespective of the use provision by any consideration of the fact that historically farmers were receiving a higher amount for their milk because a larger portion of that was available in use for Class I purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.322" offset="4928658">And secondly, the Court said, this in any event was not a market differential as that term is use in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.235" offset="4956348">Now, I first like to turn to the question of the Irrespective of Uses Clause which the Court in this case relied squarely on the prior holding in Blair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.262" offset="4996472">And after saying that it accepted the whole naturally the holding in Blair that you, Secretary was barred from taking any account of the prior use of the milk, and then went on and examine what the Secretary had said in this, this case in concluded on the basis of the statements over the time that he promulgated all the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.478" offset="5077243">That in fact, he had relied on this impermissible factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.482" offset="5093334">Now, we think that contrary to the view of the Court of --</text>

            <text syncTime="1267.934" offset="5175150">Yes Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.872" offset="5178911">For one thing in the Blair case, the Secretary had relied solely on the fact of the use of the milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.730" offset="5210258">That is the higher percentage class used, Class I use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.850" offset="5226768">Whereas in this case, we think he has indicated that the other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.530" offset="5241501">Secondly in the Blair case, the Secretary relied solely on the claim not that this was a market differential, but this was another of the statutory differentials relating to the place at which the milk was delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.438" offset="5301164">That was the sole basis of this opinion at the Blair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.481" offset="5313285">And for those reasons quite frankly, we did not feel that case would be inappropriate one to take to this Court for presenting the broad question of the Secretary's authority to include these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.211" offset="5360201">Now, this cost it seems to us the Irrespective Abuse Clause it seems to us, has nothing to do with differentials at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.719" offset="5390294">Rather, it's purpose is to make it clear that the Secretary may pay a uniform price to all farmers even though a particular farmer's milk was sold for the higher Class I use than someone else's milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.156" offset="5459989">Indeed, it was that factor that that was the basis for the unsuccessful attack in this Court in the Rock Royal Cooperative case in 307 U.S. upon the whole marketing equalization program that contention there was that it denied the farmer of his milk was being use for Class I purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.508" offset="5537416">It took us property without Due Process of law and it was discriminatory that he didn't get the full value of his milk, that he got only the blended price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.406" offset="5568972">And we think in Stark against Wickard, this Court made it very clear that that was the sole purpose of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.344" offset="5592795">Now of course under this arrangement, all of the farmers, all of the nearby farmers get the identical price for their milk without regard to the use made of their milk by the particular handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.109" offset="5647757">Statute speaks and the use is made of that such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.832" offset="5670745">Every single one of the farmers located within this nearby area gets the blended price, plus the differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.633" offset="5701883">He gets it whether his handler sells all of his milk for Class I use, all of his milk for Class II use or some blend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.204" offset="5732185">And we fail for a think that the validity of these differentials does not at all depend upon the Irrespective of Use Clause that the way of determine the validity of these differentials is looking to the next clause which deals with the adjustments and differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.621" offset="5789863">And therefore, it seems to us the critical question in the case is whether this market different leaves, differentials are market differentials customarily applied by the handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.692" offset="5834167">The act of course does not define market differentials, and we think what this phrase means is a differential that customarily has been applied by the handlers in the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.637" offset="6085883">The Court of Appeals said that all it is covered by the phrase market differential is payments which a farmer receives extra payments for delivering his milk to the country -- city plant rather than to the country plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.634" offset="6149935">That is, it's a differential for delivering they say in the city market rather than the country market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.753" offset="6174386">That interpretation rest on a statement in the committee reports which so describes the market differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.910" offset="6211062">We think in the light of all this history that this decrypting was merely intended to be illustrative of the type of market differential and it was not intended to define the outer limits of the differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.319" offset="6260694">We have set forth in our brief, it's somewhat complicated the reasons why if this language was construed as the Court of Appeals construed it, it would not be particularly meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.528" offset="6301445">There be other phrase of the statute that will embrace the type of differential at the Court of Appeals thought was the market differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.168" offset="6336031">Now as I pointed out earlier that in 1939, the First Circuit upheld the validity of the market differentials in the 1937 Boston Milk Marketing Order and express -- explicitly held that they were market differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.922" offset="6415026">And in addition to that as we develop in our brief, we think that this Court's decision in the Rock Royal Case, although, it dealt not with differentials paid on a market wise basis but by individual handlers, nevertheless since the operative language of the two sets in the statute is the same as equally applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.899" offset="6587016">Mr. Justice, I think the whole history of this statute shows that, what Congress was trying to do in this case was to stabilize milk markets to eliminate the cut throat competition within the existing pricing structure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.265" offset="6708433">That's right because that Mr. Justice, it was the fact that payments would tied to the end use that led to this drastic and devastating competition among the farmers driving down the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.155" offset="6755976">And that's what they were attempting to do, it seems to us, was to eliminate as a fact that leading to the depressing of milk prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.952" offset="6787218">Farmers fighting each other to see which one could have the greatest share of the Class I market and preventing the handlers from using this is to leaver to fight them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.103" offset="6827760">But once that was accomplished, once that type of the limp competition was eliminated, it seems that what cut to us that would Congress was trying to do was to say that that was as far as you could go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.418" offset="6869034">You could eliminate this type of pricing competition that was not to be the radical realignment, the radical changing of the structure of the milk marketing that is results from this decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.318" offset="6920652">Now, the respondents repeatedly tell us that this is a very unfair thing that the effect of this differential is basically requiring the farmers in the distant markets to subsidies a nearby farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.064" offset="6991600">And they say, if in fact this nearby milk has some value to do the handlers, let the handlers pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.495" offset="7017305">Don't make us pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.714" offset="7026186">This again it seems to us rests on the mistaken notion that under the act, all farmers have to be treated equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.287" offset="7060564">We think under the act, what it is that all farmers are to be treated equitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.122" offset="7083865">That is they are to receive the same prices subject to the various differentials provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.029" offset="7107480">And if as we believe the market differentials that here are permissible that farm location differentials are valid as market differentials, it seems it's quite immaterial with the effect of paying this differential as to reduce the blended price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.828" offset="7166725">That's precisely we think, but the statute contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.547" offset="7181563">And if the handlers would give them discretion to decide to whom to make payments for the additional values, how much under what circumstances fee -- its very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.895" offset="7222941">This will be exactly this sort of thing that Congress was trying to prevent; the same kind of cut throat competition that you have back in the early days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.578" offset="7261706">And finally, the arc man it seems to us rests on a mistaken, at least, a dubious factual assumption, the assumption that somehow, if you'll eliminated the nearby differential and increase the blended price, the distant farmers would be much better off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.597" offset="7325759">Well of course they'll be much better off immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.733" offset="7334327">They get 12 cents more a 100-pound, but it doesn't follow at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.701" offset="7358151">But in the long run, they'll be any better off because once you increase the blended price in the Boston market, the result is likely to be that handlers operating in other areas will begin to bring their milk into the Boston market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.598" offset="7413739">This will create a surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.913" offset="7419068">This in turn will result in depressing the price in the Boston market and the end result for all that appears is that the prices maybe driven down, indeed even below the present level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.224" offset="7464312">And then there's another problem is which is that everyone knows farms is having a hard time today that the nearby farmers for more than 30 years have acted on the assumption that would receive this differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.113" offset="7515826">That these differentials have suddenly terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.828" offset="7526693">There's a reason to believe that a large number of nearby farmers in the Boston area have may decide either that they can use their land more profitably for something other than farming and they sell out to the real estate, subdivided it, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.891" offset="7578937">So, the end result again is likely that it be a serious shortage of milk for the nearby area and once again, leading to great instability in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.907" offset="7623032">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.842" offset="7678725">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.433" offset="7693145">I'm Lawrence D. Hollman, counsel for petitioner's Frederick T. Zuber et al, seven nearby milk farmers located within the 46-cent or nearby zone within the Massachusetts, Rhode Island milk marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.409" offset="7777050">They and some two thousand other farmers have been consistently for over 30 years under federal orders recipients of the nearby differentials at the identical race that are now in effect 46 cents and 23 cents either under the Massachusetts, Rhode Island order or under the constituent Boston and secondary market orders which were consolidated in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.574" offset="7901706">Essentially, these are farmers who deliver their milk to urban centers within the concentrated populations of New England, Massachusetts for example on Boston, Worcester, Springfield, Brockton, Holy Oak, Fall River cities which are fairly sizeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.477" offset="7985298">And one other point, these nearby farmers are not the large and affluent farmers within the marketing area, anymore than are the distant farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.080" offset="8035662">There's evidence in the original record affidavits that were submitted by the seven nearby farmers, file as Government exhibit three in support of its opposition of preliminary injunction, which indicates that their return on investment is a very neither one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.428" offset="8101073">And that without the nearby differential, that could well shift their neither profits to losses as a result of their dairying operations.</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_d_hollman" startTime="2025.485" stopTime="2413.312">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence D. Hollman</label>
            <text syncTime="2025.485" offset="8205354">Which was 46 cents and 23 cents Your Honor.46 cents?Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.184" offset="8224057">Of the same identical rate under the Boston order, originally promulgated in 1937 after the Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of 37 and under the secondary marketing orders which will promulgated by the Secretary in 1949 for Worcester and Springfield, and in 1958 I believe for Southeastern New England.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.242" offset="8320293">Approximately the same differentials were also paid under the 1936 Boston order of the Secretary and essentially the same in subsequence that is the same amount to the same people were paid under licenses, Boston license, issued under the 1933 Act or perhaps even more importantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.679" offset="8410049">Approximately the same amount was paid to these nearby farmers before federal regulation began and here I'd like to supplement certain comments that Mr. Freidman made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.786" offset="8458533">Before federal regulation commence in these markets, most large for preponderance of the farmers in the Mass, Rhode Island markets, both nearby and distant were members of cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.973" offset="8507225">These cooperatives, the largest of which I believe at the time and still today is New England Milk Producers Association, entered into collective bargaining agreements with handlers that started in the 20's and perhaps even shortly before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.044" offset="8567515">Under these collective bargain agreements, the nearby farmers receive a higher price which in effect reflected the 46-cent differential that they received today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.603" offset="8625821">But the one problem that develop with respect to these collective bargaining agreements in the early 30's and why federal regulation was necessary and indeed why the triple A in part was pass was because destructive competition had in sued within the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.629" offset="8689873">This was competition among the handlers and let me explain this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.027" offset="8711502">Under the collective bargaining agreements, a handler would agree to pay certain prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.335" offset="8736684">A handler or dairy would agree to pay certain prices to the cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.146" offset="8751940">The cooperatives at that time were also using a system not at all dissimilar in fact quite similar to the equalization fluid and blend price enforced today under the Secretary's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.566" offset="8805648">And under that equalization and blending classified price system in nearby farmers received a higher price by approximately 46 cents per hundredweight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.482" offset="8853295">But all handlers would not enter into these agreements with the cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.877" offset="8870849">And as long as you had any significant number of handlers who would not do so, they could then go to other farmers within the market place not numbers of the cooperative, and offer them a price not equal to the Class I fluid milk price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.770" offset="8930408">But just slightly above the blend price that the cooperatives were paying to their members under the collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.799" offset="8958516">As a result of that, they could charge lower prices these outside handlers not members of the collective bargaining agreements could charge lower prices to consumers and thereby increase their consumer markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.102" offset="9015777">As a result the coops who are members of the collective or parties to the collective bargaining agreements, then had to reduce their price which means they had to put pressure on their producers to take lower prices and this kept going on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.303" offset="9072619">So that what Congress intended to do as at under the triple A of 33 and the 35 Act expressly to follow the same patterns that the cooperatives had followed and they stated this in their committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.416" offset="9129044">But to bring all handlers in under regulation because it is the handlers who are regulated under the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.194" offset="9156106">Not the producers as such directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.591" offset="9165720">A producers have no right to go into court to appeal from an order under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.622" offset="9189857">Their right is established here for example under this Court's holding and Stark against Wickard, to the extent they can complain of any diminishment in what they should rightfully or otherwise, get from the equalization pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.105" offset="9239803">But the regulations is a regulation of handlers and as long as a particular farmer or groups of farmers sell to a handler who markets some milk in this market today for fluid milk purposes, that farmer gets the advantage of the blend price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.392" offset="9308975">Now in fact, the requirement here is really quite minimal that is much of the milk that many farmers sell to handlers is use for the lower price, manufacturing purposes; cheese, butter, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.021" offset="9371460">But because their handler may shift no more than a 25% of his milk into the market for fluid purposes during a few months of the year, and I believe 15% during three other months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.046" offset="9427571">That handler qualifies all his farmers for the fluid milk price, even though, most or all or large part of their milk is going for Class II are manufactured milk purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.180" offset="9476054">I'd like to comment on what the interest is of the nearby farmers here because I think there are at least three points which reflect in the opinion of the Court below and on the equities here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.248" offset="9532374">The nearby farmers have consistently received these differentials over the years and always in excess of transportation and handling cost savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.081" offset="9575737">Overwhelmingly, these orders have been approved by referendum both the Mass, Rhode Island Order in 64, the Boston order in 37, and the secondary market orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.741" offset="9622340">Each time, an overwhelming approval by farmers and farmers must vote to approve this order by a vote more than two thirds of the farmers in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.805" offset="9654627">If that vote is not obtained, there is no regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.730" offset="9666330">This is a unique partnership between the Secretary and the farmers and perhaps the most salient point here is that the nearby farmers who have voted for this order have always been a minority of the farmers in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.849" offset="9718784">The distant farmers have I think consistently over the years numbered well over 50%, indeed over the two third that is necessary to approved the order that --</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.171" offset="9792031">My understanding Your Honor is that the system the Secretary employs is one-farmer-one-vote by referendum and approving these orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.982" offset="9827349">Now, in fact however Your Honor, the statute also authorizes cooperatives to vote for their members and so, in this voting from time to time, I think quite consistently in fact, the cooperatives due vote for their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.679" offset="9886072">The largest cooperative in the Mass, Rhode Island market, I believe Your Honor, is still today is NEMPA which is more heavily distant producers than nearby producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2576.760" offset="10410402">The 46-cent and 23-cent differentials were retained in the identical rate that they were under the constituent orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.128" offset="10451884">What did happen was that as a result of bringing into the Boston order which was the by far largest order here counting for over 75% of the farmers in the market by bringing in secondary markets which had high fluid use, the ultimate result for those distant producers, marketing in the Boston order just before consolidation was to increase the amount of money they receive in the 12-month period after consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.697" offset="10570167">Three cents more per hundredweight in what they had received before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.726" offset="10590229">One other quite obvious reason that the nearby farmers are interested here and indeed, they sort to intervene before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.047" offset="10623561">That intervention was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.556" offset="10629622">It was pursued on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.828" offset="10670686">Thereafter, the District Court rendered it summary judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.172" offset="10688031">At that point, the nearby farmers sought a stay of the summary judgment order in aid of their appeal on intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.791" offset="10722513">In that proceeding, the Court of Appeals denied the stay, a stay which already been denied in effect to the Government by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.126" offset="10755845">Court of Appeals denied the stay but gave the nearby farmer applicants for intervention, the choice by mooting their appeal on the intervention point to go -- to take -- to become interveners for the purpose of filing an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.684" offset="10822092">Not to enter into the District Court proceeding which had already terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.934" offset="10839124">In effect, that was a Hobson's choice since for the nearby farmers not to have elected that option would have meant that the escrow fund would have been distributed out to the distant farmers, farmers who would never relied on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.575" offset="10901713">As a result, the nearby farmers chose the route, which enable them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.315" offset="10920626">One, to prosecute an appeal at that time the Government have not noted an appeal and also to move before the District Court for a stay since the Court of Appeals had denied the state of a nearby farmers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.694" offset="11126157">These are certainly crucial words in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.061" offset="11187597">They had to be variations that were customarily paid by the handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.543" offset="11205569">Usual market variations, I believe that's what this Court in 39 decision in Rock Royal referred to the matters and they had to be not sporadically applied by handlers before the act was pass and before the order, I'm sorry, before the order took effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.496" offset="11273383">They had to be customarily applied by handlers before that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.722" offset="11482258">It was not identical with the differential involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.738" offset="11498350">It provided not only for farm location but said also that farmers must deliver to plants located within the nearby zone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.093" offset="11555715">They did so years ago and we're advised today by the Market Administrator in the market that virtually all nearby farmers delivered the plants within the market's core -- close to the major markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.655" offset="11605974">We believe one of the major reasons that the Court of Appeals went astray as Mr. Friedman is already commented, is that they looked to -- they made erroneous factual assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.743" offset="11654353">They thought that the differential pre 1937 was not one paid over and above transportation and handling cost savings was not one paid to distant farmers who delivered to a nearby zone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.933" offset="11907114">Frankly, the committee report language regarding market differential is not a model of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.299" offset="11936580">Among other things, the report language would indicate that the differentials they were talking about were usually paid in secondary markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.135" offset="11983914">And I believe the Court in Blair said that market differential there depended upon the nature of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.575" offset="12013693">Nature of the market I believe, they thought of a secondary markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.673" offset="12034069">But in fact, not only the nearby differentials but the country station differentials which respondent say in the Court of Appeals below says, where market differentials are those paid in primary markets and traditionally, they've been paid in primary markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.359" offset="12112854">While the lower court did not get into the question of substantial evidence, they certainly looked to certain excerpts from the evidence in analyzing the interpretation and construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.886" offset="12186937">For that reason and because we believe that if this Court reverses finding that the Secretary had the authority to put a nearby farm location differential in the Mass, Rhode Island market, then it can at that point dispose of this case rather than remanding it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.302" offset="14016554">First, I'd like to make a couple of preliminary observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.322" offset="14040691">This particular differential has no relationship at all to any 40-mile zone from any principal consumption center or the City of Boston or any other city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.957" offset="14103176">That was true of the 1937 greater Boston order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.404" offset="14125014">But at the present time under the consolidated orders, all dairy farmers within the State of Connecticut and all dairy farmers within the State of Massachusetts other than one county are all classified as nearby producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.223" offset="14192306">Initially, the under the greater Boston market order, there were over 7,400 distant producers serving that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.466" offset="14237236">They supplied approximately 92% of the milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.418" offset="14253014">At that time, there were 672 nearby producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.821" offset="14274644">And at the present time as the petitioners have indicated, there are over 2,000 approximately 2,200 nearby producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.741" offset="14322291">So, the percentage under the old regime was nearby producers for something about 8% or so?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Patrick Ryan</label>
            <text syncTime="3564.662" offset="14361997">Approximately one third.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.328" offset="14368684">The significance -- the significance of that Your Honor, Mr. Justice is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.168" offset="14396061">That under the Boston order, the distant producers, so-called distant producers only paid under this nearby differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.077" offset="14431692">Two to three cents per hundredweight, they did not have to pay the 46 cents simply for the reason if they were so many distant producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.870" offset="14478817">As their numbers have been cut and as the nearby producers have increased in number, the differential that is deducted from their milk price has grown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.784" offset="14526464">Initially, it was a factor that was regarded as admittedly illegal, but that they could afford to wink at it so to speak, in order to get the benefits of federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.670" offset="14570036">But at the present time it has grown like the proverbial topsy and it has a resulted in its incorporation and to other others simply because of the fact that existed in the Boston order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.341" offset="14624684">Now on that connection, I think its important to realize that this particular differential exist in only one other milk order in the United States out of approximate 75 federal milk marketing orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.290" offset="14680482">That fact conclusively indicates that is not a vital provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.876" offset="14706918">It's not a necessary provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.664" offset="14714023">The only effect that it has is to discriminate against the marketings of distant producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.299" offset="14740564">The only other milk order which contain is particular differential is a Connecticut federal milk marketing order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.585" offset="14769716">And that illustrates very graphically the injury that a differential provision of this type can effect upon distant producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.433" offset="14821125">Under the Connecticut milk order, there are only 89 to 95 dairy farmers that are characterized as distant or non-nearby dairy farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.134" offset="14871907">There are approximately 2,000 that are characterized as nearby dairy farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.884" offset="14894895">All of your dairy farmers within the State of Connecticut are termed nearby dairy farmers even though at least 50% of the milk for that market is supplied by out of state dairy farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.387" offset="14956962">Now, the result is under the computation in that exactly reverse situation that the distant dairy farmers marketing under that order have to pay 44 cents for every hundred pounds of milk of their needed milk that they regularly market in the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.205" offset="15044211">Now, how this is benefit the Connecticut nearby producer?</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.100" offset="15059780">It increases his price not by 46 cents but by 2 cents per hundredweight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.399" offset="15093008">That is simply a trivital to the fact that there are not enough distant producers to pay this differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.935" offset="15123101">The distant producers under that order loose from $5,000.00 to $6,000.00 a year in order to benefit the nearby producer in the amount of approximately $12.50 a month.</text>

            <text syncTime="3806.796" offset="15330513">The distant farmer in Vermont, take for example, if he wants to market his milk, his needed milk, although, he is supplied Boston, say for instance for over 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.856" offset="15382758">He has to pay this differential to nearby producers located in the States of Connecticut and Massachusetts and Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.223" offset="15432286">Rhode Island is a very small factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.329" offset="15440645">They produce only about 1% of the milk for the market and are not significant factor in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.434" offset="15473142">However, if the Vermont producer or the main producer of the New Hampshire producer wants to market his needed milk in the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.408" offset="15517027">He also has to pay the same differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.627" offset="15529880">Only this time in a much larger amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.958" offset="15543254">By the same token, the Connecticut producer collects both ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="4226.867" offset="17010813">That a more basic violation of the act could not be comprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.919" offset="17027009">It's our contention that initially the Agricultural Adjustment Act was passed for the simple reason that all dairy farmers were receiving very low prices for the milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.613" offset="17077791">The fact that some dairy farmers have received higher prices than others in the 1920's has no real relevancy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.606" offset="17113840">The fact is that the private sector of the milk industry that cooperatives and so forth, there were varying prices that actually contributed to the market instability here and it resulted eventually in all producers receiving low prices for their milk, below the cost the production actually in the 1929 to '33 period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.058" offset="17211643">And consequently because of the fact that a state as this Court held in Bowman versus Ceiling could not regulate the price of milk that moved across interstate borders, the Congress was force to meet this problem by the enactment of the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.245" offset="17292309">That provided primarily for solving the problem through marketing agreements and supplementing licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.969" offset="17327208">But the licenses and the marketing agreements were at that time relegated solely to the prevention of unfair trade practices and the act was very vague and nebulous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.033" offset="17379453">As a result, many different features were included within these licenses that were doubtful legality and definitely against public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.602" offset="17417801">As a result, the handlers actually refuse to comply with the different provisions of these licenses as did the producers and this compounded the situation, in fact that Congress was well aware from different reports from the Federal Trade Commission that the situation was such that the act would have to be amended if it was to be made workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.500" offset="17517380">And in 1935, they so amend the act so extensively that is referred to as the 1935 Act which is the Court has also characterized it as such some of its decisions of that particular 1935 Act get away with the licenses and included a provision whereby the Secretary was authorized to issue milk marketing orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.051" offset="17619571">But the Congress was very definite and stating that these orders could contain the enumerated terms and conditions and no others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.533" offset="17669517">The Secretary of course has discretion concerning which terms to include in this particular others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.618" offset="17697834">But he of course, cannot amend the act or reappeal by including within it various provisions without any statutory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.345" offset="17736704">And as the petitioners have indicated the primary problem involved here in the milk industry is not only that milk is highly perishable, but also that there is a surplus of milk, a necessary surplus even in a short production season of the year approximately 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.969" offset="17815280">This, of course results in a much larger surplus during the flash production season of the year and this is unnecessary surplus and in a Secretary has found as recently as 1957 that without regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4484.219" offset="18040247">This is in the record that you have to maintain the necessary reserved in order to protect the consumer by an adequate milk supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.987" offset="18075355">And it is the contention of the respondents here that the Congress was motivated to solve this problem by apportioning the burdens of surplus along with the benefits of the Class I or fluid milk price through the issuance of a program that call for a uniform price to all dairy farmers, irrespective of the use of their particular milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.892" offset="18194892">Now, of course, this was the big problem that some dealers had a fluid milk outlet for their milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.055" offset="18227597">Producers that were selling to that particular handler or dealer where sometimes able to obtain a higher price than other dairy farmers and other handlers serving another handler who was able not to sell in the fluid milk market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.623" offset="18301889">And although the petitioners here cite the case of Rock Royal is authority for this differential, we contend that it was -- is clearly just the opposite and the Rock Royal actually, it was -- there were no producers before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.868" offset="18374823">It was a case that involves solely handlers and it was shortly after the passage of the 1937 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.158" offset="18408051">The handlers contended that it violated their constitutional rights to require them to pay a part of the monies that they have obtained from the Class I sales into the market wide pool or producer settlement fund in order that these monies would be paid over to other handlers who have low fluid sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.318" offset="18516616">Most of their milk was dispose of for manufacturing purposes, but it's obvious that the congressional plan couldn't work unless there was a provision of this nature and also that Congress did not provide for any great unusual situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.046" offset="18595506">They provided for minimum milk prices that the handler was obligated to pay for milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.751" offset="18622360">Now, the Court in Rock Royal held that it was not a violation of Due Process or the taking of the handler's property to require him to pay the excess of his fluid sales over the market wide average into the producer settlement fund for distribution to other handlers who in turn would pay these monies to their own producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.691" offset="18730088">Now, its very evident that if a handler could not retain these monies over the market wide blend price and pay them into his own producer and was obligated to pay this into the fund that a dairy farmers that server that particular handler certainly couldn't make the same claim that this could be accomplish indirectly through a nearby differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.565" offset="18845654">Now, we contend that the words irrespective of use simply mean that a dairy farmer is entitle to the payment of the uniform price irrespective of the use of his milk and in every case in which this Court has considered the milk appeal, they have indicated that this is the interpretation of the congressional language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.831" offset="18934680">Now, the contentions of the petitioners would actually nullify the act, if they were to delete that language and simply say that this means that you can pay a dairy farm around the basis of use of his milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.232" offset="19004270">This is clearly just the opposite of what the Congress contended should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.482" offset="19025272">Now, the petitioners acknowledge that in the Blair case that the adjustments to the uniform price in that case involved a location differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.885" offset="19086921">Location differential really is nothing more than a differential that is allowed for the transportation element that enters into the price of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.850" offset="19130807">Milk that is delivered to one part of the milk shed naturally is has to be delivered to the primary consumption center.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.328" offset="19168632">These are the large cities and the dairy farmer does have to pay for those transportation cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="4815.170" offset="19364028">And you have to have the system whereby you set up zones and fix a particular transportation charge for each zone as related to the principal consumption center because this is the where the milk is going, this is where its produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.445" offset="19445112">And of course, the Court in Blair held that this was not a proper differential to justify the one that was in the New York order in which was very similar to the one that is in this order that that related strictly to transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.845" offset="19514702">Now, if the petitioners -- I don't understand whether they currently maintain that that is a proper differential that would support the location differential that would support the nearby differential involve in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.685" offset="19582098">But they seem to be limiting their argument at the present time to the fact that it is a market differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.270" offset="19608430">Now, the reports clearly state that a market differential is a differential that is paid to a dairy farmer for delivering his milk to a city market rather than to a country plant because in a country plant, there are double handling cost involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.111" offset="19679796">And the measure of this particular market differential is normally the difference between the receiving cost that the country plant and that at the city plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.936" offset="19727130">And the dairy farmers pay that particular differential because he actually performs a service there and he accomplishes a reduction and the cost of the handler that maintains the various country plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.839" offset="19794735">Now the Congress, if the reports are examined both the House and Senate reports show that they gave great consideration to this particular 1935 Act because of the reason Schechter case and the recent case of Panama versus Ryan, the other particular case that dealt with delegation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.450" offset="19897135">It was very careful to spell out in complete detail what provision the Secretary could include in this milk orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.230" offset="19932244">And we contend that there's a no possible basis for saying that there's any statutory justification for the nearby differential when that particular differential is not even mention either in the act or in any of the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.595" offset="19993788">Now, the act provides for a volume market and production differentials and our understanding of the petitioner's contention here is that the market differential is simply illustrative in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.254" offset="20052407">Now if this was true, there'd be no point in the Congress specifying the volume differential, the production differential, the butter fat differential, the quality differential, the location differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.692" offset="20110190">They could simply have set all customary market differentials, if this was what they meant by market differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.456" offset="20141223">But it was not and this is clearly reflected in the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.322" offset="20164629">Incidentally, the nearby producer can deliver his milk to a country plant and still receive this nearby differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.524" offset="20205484">Whereas the distant producer can deliver his milk right to the market center and he does not receive this differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.153" offset="20239966">And in fact he has to pay the nearby producer this particular differential out of his milk price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.367" offset="20268805">So, it's just exactly the opposite of what the Congress has defined the market differential to be; one for delivery to the city market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.444" offset="20309138">Also, the only exception to the uniform price that is authorized by the act is one which is provided for in Section 8c (5) (B) pertaining to new producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.565" offset="20365667">The Congress was concern that handlers were bringing milk into various markets and beating down local prices within that reach of market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.044" offset="20407568">But it was also concerned that if wanted to make sure that new producers would be given reasonable opportunities to enter markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.480" offset="20445288">In other words, that these would not be close markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.723" offset="20458245">Consequently, provision 8c (5) (B) provides that a new producer is to conceive the same price as any other producer after he serves a particular market for two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.514" offset="20513416">Now, the two months probationary period is obviously for the purpose of assuring that he is going to regularly supply that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.210" offset="20548211">During that period, he receives the lowest price use classification price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.591" offset="20573706">During that particular two months and this is to assure that he will not market his milk in a particular region only when it's an opportunity time for him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.902" offset="20618951">Now, under the particular provision 8c (5) (B) pertaining to new producers that specifically states that that lowest used price that he is to receive during those two months is subject to all other adjustments authorize under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.128" offset="20695855">Now for instance, he would receive the butter fat differential if his milk wanted it, he would be subject to the transportation differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.267" offset="20732426">He would be subject to the market differential for direct delivery of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.291" offset="20752488">But under the act he would also, if this nearby differential is a valid differential, he would also be subject to the nearby differential and this would result in a new producer whom the act requires to receive the lowest possible price during the first two months of his delivery because of the fact that he is never supplied this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.419" offset="20849037">He would receive a differential under this nearby differential provision which would pay him because of the fluid use his milk on a historical basis, even though he had never supplied the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.157" offset="20916015">Now, this is a double link consistency that cannot be attributed to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.921" offset="20939107">This is an inconsistency that is particularly applicable only to the Secretary and even if he didn't pay this nearby differential to these new producers, this simply could not be explain the way by a second violation because the act requires that all of the adjustments be taken into account even in respect to these new producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="5257.441" offset="21133145">But that to one side, what is the reason from the Secretary's point of view, what is the reason why other milk marketing orders do not contain these nearby differentials?</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.593" offset="21173791">Do you know?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_patrick_ryan" startTime="5267.814" stopTime="6311.675">
            <label>Mr. Charles Patrick Ryan</label>
            <text syncTime="5267.814" offset="21174627">Well, he has not given a reason for other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.463" offset="21193226">He has said in respect to Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut producers that historically, dairy farmers in the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut because of their location with reference to the large population concentrations of New England have disposed of a substantially larger percentage of their production for fluid use than have dairy farmers in the up country area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.083" offset="21295731">Hence, nearby producers have been able to realize that price higher in relation to more distant producers than can be accounted for by the advantage of the transportation to market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.970" offset="21335228">Under market wide pooling here in propose and without some adjustment mechanism, the nearby producer notwithstanding would be paid on the basis of the air utilization of all milk in the milk shed rather than according to the utilization of his milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.894" offset="21402937">Now, this is a direct admission of a violation of the act because the act specifically states that no dairy farmer is to be paid on the basis of the use of his milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.625" offset="21457899">He is to be paid a uniform price irrespective of the use of his milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.784" offset="21478484">The Secretary also found that under a regulated market, the nearby producer also obtains the protection of the federal regulatory program and receives in many instances, a higher price and he would otherwise received.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.515" offset="21557478">So, we come to the a situation where prior to federal regulation, all dairy farmers where receiving low prices and even prior to the 1964 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.471" offset="21613275">Much of the local produced milk had been dispose of for manufacturing your surplus purposes and its just not an accuracy to say that nearby producers consistently supply the fluid milk market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.514" offset="21681403">In fact as recently as 1946, the Secretary had to amend the Boston order because of the fact that the nearby producers where supplying milk to the country plants and were receiving actually a higher price than what they were entitled to at those particular plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.873" offset="21762905">Now, we also feel that this Court's specifically stated in Rock Royal that any variants between uniform prices would result in a discrimination and would actually cause certain producers to bear an unfair burden of the surplus market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.381" offset="21856946">And this is exactly what the nearby differential does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.722" offset="21870216">It reserves the fluid milk market or a larger percentage of it to nearby producers and it cast on other producers who regularly supply the market a larger share of the burden of surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.297" offset="21928521">Now, the Secretary has also admitted that nearby milk has no inherent value that should be compensated for by nearby producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.769" offset="21974497">In his New York decision, all of these particular factors where raised in apparent justification for this differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.879" offset="22010859">He rejected all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.649" offset="22017964">He rejected the factor of inherent value of nearby milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.267" offset="22036459">He rejected the factor of its availability or its accessibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.950" offset="22055163">He rejected the factor of so-called increased production cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.966" offset="22079195">He rejected everything except the fact that he thought they should be paid on the basis of the historical use of their milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.982" offset="22115349">And of course, this is a direct violation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.220" offset="22128201">Now also in Hood, in the Hood case decided on the very same day that the Rock Royal case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.082" offset="22159653">This Court also stated in that case that the producers, the intervene in that case where not entitled to maintain a historically price under this particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.353" offset="22228825">The lower court had stated that the only right to a historical price higher price that producer's head depended upon the unconstitutionality of this Act and that they were entitled only to a blend price or to the uniform price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.474" offset="22301236">And we feel that the Hood case is a direct authority for our position here that historical prices are not the criterion for insertion into a milk order that the criterion is uniform prices rather than varying historical prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.708" offset="22370200">Now, the petitioners have also indicated that there some question as to the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.825" offset="22394650">Actually, the case in the New York-New Jersey milk order was also heard on motions for summary judgment, cross motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.551" offset="22437595">I don't know of any milk case that hasn't been heard on excerpts from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.051" offset="22463613">Now, when they say excerpts from the record, they imply that there some deficiency here, but there is no deficiency in the Blair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.499" offset="22505409">There was a 15,000-page record with hundreds of exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.507" offset="22525367">It was necessary to excerpt a relevant material in order that the Court could actually comprehend the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.760" offset="22558386">The same thing occurred in this case and every page of the administrative record that was pertinent to the issue was before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.124" offset="22607914">And the nearby producers, although they presently say that they were denied intervention in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.608" offset="22637798">They were accorded every opportunity to present whatever argument that they might desired to in that case in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.835" offset="22674683">They filed a brief amicus curiae through the state of or rather the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.042" offset="22711568">And the District Court had every conceivable argument that could be made before when it ruled that this particular provision was beyond the statutory power of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.675" offset="22758066">Now, we also contend that this is not only discriminatory as well as beyond the statutory power of the Secretary, but that it constitutes a trade barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.012" offset="22811460">In other words, the fact for instance in the Connecticut order illustrates this very graphically where you only have 89 or to 95 dairy farmers that are able to market their milk on a regular basis in that particular order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.353" offset="22888782">Now, they have to pay a large share of there milk price, even though it benefits the nearby producer by only 2 cents per carton, cart hundred pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.417" offset="22941027">And the inconceivable to contend that this was meant to reward nearby producers, 2 cents per hundredweight rather than to penalize distant producers and to keep distant producers out of this particular market or any market that has this particular penalty provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.591" offset="23021693">Now, if this particular differential was legalized and it spread to other markets, one can readily visualize that it would simply create chaos and disorderly marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.973" offset="23091284">In fact the very reason that this particular milk order that consolidated order came about was because of the different and varying conditions that these differentials participated, that they actually commanded to which market the milk would go.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.897" offset="23178951">It was very uneconomical and very unrealistic because the farmer wanted his milk to go the market where he would get this differential rather than have it go to a market where it could be distributed most economically for the benefit of the consumer in all dairy farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.776" offset="23258467">So, we contend that is a much more discriminatory and vicious differential then was look and validated in the Blair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.813" offset="23298591">In the Blair case, we had a differential where when the fluid milk in the market reach 80% total.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.260" offset="23336417">This particular differential would actually seize to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.038" offset="23351568">In this particular differential, it would have to reach 100% before it would seize to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.532" offset="23381452">In other words, the differential provides that is 46 cents or such lesser amount as will equal the Class I or fluid milk price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.205" offset="23428159">This means that when surplus and the market is the greatest, the differential is the greatest. And the nearby producer can actually increase his production and contribute to this surplus without worrying that his is going to sustain a reduction in this differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.417" offset="23509034">On the other hand, the distant producer, he, when he increases his production actually increases the amount that he pays under this protector of differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.467" offset="23557204">So actually, it provides protection to the nearby producer and at the same time it injures the distant producer when he needs this protection the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.242" offset="23604328">Now, we don't think that there's any possible basis that has been set forth here for remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.457" offset="23633168">The Court has fully considered all of the factors involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.222" offset="23656260">And we would also like to mention that the producer association that was mentioned by Mr. Hollman, the New England Milk Producers Association, does vote for the farmers on whether a milk order as a whole should be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5909.703" offset="23742151">But no dairy farmer has the right to vote on this particular provision of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.524" offset="23773497">Now, this is very crucial when you realize that the New England Milk Producers Association which is Boston base actually attempted to intervene in the suit as a defendant without advising any of their membership of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.286" offset="23848521">And it's a matter of record that its counsel fails to consult its membership whenever he proposes vary administrative provision that will effect their very livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5948.112" offset="23895855">And we contend that that any attempt that remand here would actually simply cause the respondents to have the attorneys for the nearby producers represent them because the NEMPA is actually controlled by nearby producer's representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.630" offset="23989896">Now, they have a much larger proportion of their membership in the distant areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.905" offset="24014973">But in the particular dairy field that we're examining here today, dairy farmers did not take that much interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5988.921" offset="24059068">I shouldn't say interest, but they're unable to effectuate changes in these dairy organizations as much as they would like to particularly when they are not advice as to what this actually going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.469" offset="24109223">So, if under any question of remand or any vote here, we would find that the New England New England Milk Producers Association would vote for the great majority or the plaintiffs that have brought this action and that the attorneys for the New England Milk Producers Associations is Mr. Hollman his associate counsel below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.592" offset="24201697">Now, we also feel that the Congress specifically intended to prevent this type of thing because there's another type of pooling other than market wide pooling which is called individual handler pooling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6039.924" offset="24263032">Under this particular provision, alternative provision of the act, all dairy farmers serving the same handler have to be also paid a uniform price, but the price does vary amongst handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.441" offset="24321128">Now, this particular type of pooling individual handler pooling is only appropriate in a market where the supplies are very short and where there is practical uniformity amongst all handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.047" offset="24383509">And this type of pooling has been found to be totally inappropriate for this particular market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.941" offset="24411094">But the important thing is that in order to institute that type of pooling, the Congress has provided that every producer should have one vote on that particular issue alone in a separate referendum on that one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6092.618" offset="24473893">And this, in our mind indicates that the Congress was concern that the associations could sometimes vote hand different things that would affect their membership if they fail to consult with them and the Congress wanted to preclude this type of happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.121" offset="24547871">Also, we would like to point out that in respect to summary judgment that the Lehigh Valley case was heard on motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6126.466" offset="24609207">The New York Currency Producers versus Wickard case was heard on motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.609" offset="24641808">And indeed, the petitioners here propose in January, shortly after the institution of this suit that the case be heard on cross motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.841" offset="24690709">Now subsequently, they withdrew that particular proposal, but nevertheless, they were desirers of disposing of the suit at that time and nothing was brought up in the District Court that would in anyway reflect on the propriety of the granting of summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.228" offset="24756328">The record was very voluminous five large files in the administrative record numbered many hundreds of pages as illustrated by the 753-page appendix here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.911" offset="24819022">So, every facet of this particular differential was considered and also the act requires that the Secretary institute only differential that had been customarily applied by handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.014" offset="24883388">Now, the record, the administrative record reflects that this differential had never been applied by handlers, and this is the reason why the petitioners advert to the contracts of various cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.942" offset="24939186">None of these being in a matter of record and in this case or any other case that I know of, there's no document dairy evidence whatsoever to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.139" offset="24975966">The fact is that the records choose conclusively that this particular differential did not exist until August 1, 1937 in the Boston order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.312" offset="25016613">It could not have been legalized or validated by the Congress because of the fact that the 1937 reenactment occurred on June 3, 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.289" offset="25064573">Of this particular differential was instituted subsequent to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6244.668" offset="25082023">So, there's no actual question of reenactment even involved this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.392" offset="25104906">Also, they alleged that similar differentials existed prior the 1937 however.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.120" offset="25139806">But actually, this is not the case because the similar differentials actually number one, required delivery of the milk to the city market and the nearby differential does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.279" offset="25196440">So, we have that distinguishment here between the pre 1937 and the post 1937 differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="6281.650" offset="25229981">Also, the similar differentials that they're referring to is actually what is known under the act base rating.</text>
            <text syncTime="6289.006" offset="25259447">Base rating requires that all dairy farmers receive the same fluid or Class I milk price for their base milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.989" offset="25299362">But under the 1936 order, only the nearby producer received the Class I or fluid milk price for his base milk.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Patrick Ryan</label>
            <text syncTime="6313.849" offset="25358817">It means this that they compute the demand, the normal demands of the market and they divide up the market, the fluid milk market and assign each producer a base.</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.203" offset="25412211">And the base is a quota that he supposed to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6330.870" offset="25426840">For that particular quota, he will received the fluid milk for Class I milk price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6337.188" offset="25452126">Anything he produces in excess of that, he will receive the manufactured or surplus price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6344.280" offset="25480443">Now, he is free to produce as much milk as he likes, but any milk produce in excess of his base is paid for at the surplus price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.925" offset="25527045">Under the act and this has been reaffirmed in 1965 in the Food and Agriculture Act, all producers are entitled to received that fluid or Class I price for their base milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="6370.586" offset="25585768">You cannot give it that price to the nearby producers and the rest of the surplus to the distant producers and this is what is referred to a similar differentials by the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.808" offset="25650552">Actually, this is an admission of the illegality of the so-called similar differentials because of the very fact that they are related to use and constitute a violation of the base rating plans of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6409.392" offset="25740936">Now, they have mentioned the case of the Green Valley Creamery from the First Circuit has been authority for the promulgation of this particular nearby differential as a market differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.080" offset="25791718">We just like to point out that in the Green Valley case, there were no producers before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.137" offset="25815960">That was a handler case for enforcement and involved entirely different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.318" offset="25836648">Moreover, the Court there did not even examine this issue for the very reason that it was not properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6444.404" offset="25880952">This was the contention of the Government that handlers could not question disbursements from out of the pool and that therefore, when the handlers attempted to raise this argument concerning the nearby differential, the Government's argument was accepted that this particular contention or issue could not be raise by handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6466.096" offset="25967783">So, we have the Government contending that they have relied on the Green Valley decision when that Court actually accepted its argument for that particular issue concerning the legality of a nearby differential was not even before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.713" offset="26026193">Also the Green Valley Court actually fail to realize that the market differential which it said was a valid differential on which we agree was already in the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6496.085" offset="26087737">It confused the market differential with the nearby differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.124" offset="26107904">The Court and Green Valley thought that there was a benefit in a service provided when milk was delivered to the city market and it stated that it was of the impression that nearby producers did deliver their milk to the city market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.808" offset="26170598">Now, there is no question but what this is a compensable service or value.</text>
            <text syncTime="6522.976" offset="26195257">But this was already in the order and a reading of the Green Valley case will illustrate that that Court did not realize that this particular differential was already in the order and the producers were compensated for delivering their milk to the city market.</text>

            <text syncTime="6588.885" offset="26458885">At that time the act in this program was in a very fledgling state and they needed the enforcement support of the State of Massachusetts.</text>

            <text syncTime="6669.302" offset="26780609">This was found by the lower court to be a fact also.</text>
            <text syncTime="6673.431" offset="26797119">In order words, the case of Whiting Milk Company, United States versus Whiting Milk Company in the Boston market in the 30's found that is little as 2,000 quarts of milk or one tank load of milk introduce in the Boston market, not subject to regulation or control could affect the entire price of all dairy farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6697.374" offset="26892831">Consequently, you had to have control of the interstate milk and unless the local authorities would enforce that control why you had no way of actually controlling the milk market price of all the dairy farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6712.385" offset="26952913">So, this was a temporary concession in that respect, although, it was recognized that it was a deviation from the requirements of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6722.428" offset="26993037">Now, as I indicated has grown and the only evidence that was introduce during 1935 hearing, 1936 hearings was the testimony of one individual who referred to the alleged milk price receive by one dairy farmer out of about 20,000 that were supplying the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6748.731" offset="27098258">And even that price to one dairy farmer was admittedly subject to correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.164" offset="27128038">The only other evidence that was introduce that would purport to justify this was the prices paid by two handlers, smaller handlers out of hundreds that were operating in that particular market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6771.656" offset="27190000">So there actually wasn't any real evidential basis for the awarding to this differential, and this is all brought out in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="6843.252" offset="27476407">I just like to briefly emphasize some additional aspects of the factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="6851.978" offset="27511306">Vermont, unlike I think almost any other state in the country is overwhelmingly dependent on the dairy industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="6979.480" offset="28021321">Fifth, I should say that the Vermont farmers who are the overwhelming majority of the non-nearby producers have bought this nearby differential from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6990.964" offset="28067192">They have never acquiesced in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6993.628" offset="28077850">They have always opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6996.183" offset="28088090">And of course, when it comes to vote on a milk order, they have to vote for the milk order in order to avoid the chaos of unregulated milk market where they sell most of their milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="7011.977" offset="28151306">If they didn't vote for the order with this nearby differential in it, they'd be out of the ball game anyway, if I may use that slang.</text>
            <text syncTime="7022.393" offset="28192893">Sixth, there's been no record of any disruption of the New York-New Jersey milk market since the decision in Blair.</text>
            <text syncTime="7033.621" offset="28237824">Seventh, and this is already been said in Vermont, we wonder why Vermont should be the only shall we say recipient of this nearby differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.620" offset="28293831">We are most of the non-nearby producers and this nearby differential is only found in New England milk orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="7057.441" offset="28333119">So finally in conclusion, it is our position that this is not the nearby differential or farm location differential is not an authorize adjustment the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="7076.051" offset="28407620">It in fact constitutes really a de facto tariff which must be paid by Vermont farmers for the privileges of selling milk in Southern New England.</text>

            <text syncTime="7106.351" offset="28528828">First, Mr. Justice Harlan asked the question of the origin of this phrase “nearby differentials”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7112.786" offset="28554533">I think that's colloquial phrase but what the Secretary, the word Secretary used in this order in 1964, he spoke of it as farm location differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="7122.618" offset="28593821">Farm location differential which I think is a more accurate representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7126.766" offset="28610435">Now, Mr. Justice Black asked the question whether anybody would loose as a result of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7135.137" offset="28643871">They were presented in the District Court in opposition to the motion for summary judgments and it is referred to at page 84 of the record, affidavits by some of the nearby farmers which indicated that if this differential is abandoned, if this differential is struck out, they will in fact not be getting back the total expenses as result of the blended price they received.</text>
            <text syncTime="7160.076" offset="28743659">And then I'd like to refer to --</text>

            <text syncTime="7165.793" offset="28766542">I'd like to refer the two questions that Mr. Justice Stewart asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="7169.304" offset="28780544">The first you inquired Mr. Justice as to how the cooperatives vote?</text>
            <text syncTime="7173.871" offset="28798830">They do vote as a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7175.170" offset="28804054">That is if there is a division all the votes are cast in one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="7179.707" offset="28822235">On the other hand, it seems very clear that if that this vote must represent from votes of the majority and --</text>

            <text syncTime="7188.925" offset="28859120">And of course, the evidence in this case that indicates that when this 1964 order was put to a vote, it was approve by something like 89% of all the farmers in the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="7214.971" offset="28963297">Now finally, I'd like to talk just a minute about this point that they are only two other orders in the whole United States that have this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7223.266" offset="28996420">Originally, a few years ago, there were four orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="7226.138" offset="29007914">The New York-New Jersey order that was struck down, an order in Chicago which was subsequently vacated because of the unwillingness of the handlers to accept certain changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7239.274" offset="29060472">The present order which been struck down and the Connecticut order which of course is now under litigation before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the Cranston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7248.426" offset="29097044">While, these are only four out of 70 orders, they it covered roughly 40% of all the milk production in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7258.663" offset="29138004">And in addition to that, we have something which I think it's quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7263.072" offset="29155662">There's testimony in this record at page 549 and I'd like to refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7270.857" offset="29186800">As to the extent of the hold's problem of how these differentials come into being, what that causes is 549 statements -- statement that in the State of California and the State of California is a state, one of the states that has no federal regulation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7301.585" offset="29309680">This is statement of State of California, produces located nearby Los Angeles distributing plants are able to obtain more favorable contracts and thus, a higher Class I utilization then produces that are located in the central valley or any other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="7319.923" offset="29383032">In order words, even without a milk marketing order at the present time, handlers are willing to pay more to farmers who located near the or -- near the center of the market than to distant farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7335.598" offset="29445726">No coercion, no claimant, the distant farmers are required to accept to the -- quite accept this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7341.554" offset="29469550">This is the operation, the normal operation of the market and I think the reason why we don't have anymore of these provisions in milk marketing orders is just the way markets have a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="7352.342" offset="29512704">Some of the areas of the country, smaller areas what has happen is you haven't had the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="7357.415" offset="29533080">The farmers had been closer in.</text>
            <text syncTime="7359.271" offset="29540498">You haven't hired this kind of competition for the Class I market characterized these Eastern markets.</text>
