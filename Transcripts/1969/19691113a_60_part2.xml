            <label>Mr. Frank C. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="4.122" offset="119829">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.859" offset="142817">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.049" offset="159535">Before attempting to reply in detail that the arguments of counsel for the petitioners and the assistance list to general.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.967" offset="199241">I would like to address myself briefly to the record, particularly, because when this case was here before there was no factual record before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.154" offset="243963">It seems to us, first of all, that the exact language of either man of Senator Bacon's will is of great importance to every question which is presented in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.679" offset="294118">After first directing that this property something over a hundred acres originally, beheld entrust for the benefit of his wife and two daughters during their lifetimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.374" offset="336854">Senator Bacon then provided following the death of the last of them for the creation of this charitable trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.968" offset="363290">Using the following language and with the indulgence I quote “entrust for the sole, perpetual and on and then use benefit and enjoyment of the white women, white girls, white boys, and white children of the City of Macon to be by them forever use then enjoyed us a park and pleasure ground subject to the restrictions Government, Management rules and control of the Board of Managers is here enough to provide it for.”</text>
            <text syncTime="93.224" offset="476244">The said property onto no circumstances or at any time for any reason devoted to any other purpose or use except in so far as here ends specifically authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.282" offset="524518">He further stated and I quote, “I thank occasion to say that I'm limiting the use and enjoyment of this property perpetually to white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.051" offset="559626">I am not influenced by any on kindness or feeling or one of consideration for the Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.668" offset="582092">I am however without hesitation and the opinion that are in the social relations for two races white and negro should be forever suffered and that they should not have pleasure or recreation grounds to be use or enjoyed together and in common.”</text>
            <text syncTime="134.688" offset="642173">In family, in explaining the motivation for this request Senator Bacon stated first of all that it was in appreciation to the citizens of Macon a propaganda that had been bestowed upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.933" offset="691075">But especially, it was a memorial to his two decease sons.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.323" offset="708629">Using the language, I should at the same time link their memories with the pleasures and enjoyments of the women and children and girls and boys of there own race in the community of which they once belong to happy the part.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.937" offset="763068">Now, we submit that Senator Bacons purpose and intent was stated as clearly as is possible in the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.630" offset="793893">There are no conflicts or inconsistencies in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.400" offset="808939">He spelled out one purpose and one purpose only and that was the operation of a park on a racially restricted basis for the sole and exclusive benefit of the white citizens or segment of them of the city of Macon.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank C. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="195.457" offset="885217">It was provided, Your Honor, that with the permission on of the Board of Managers which how speak about in just a moment that white men and the community would be permitted to use authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.466" offset="925236">That was a discretionary use so in the discretion of the Board of Managers.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="209.875" offset="942895">How would the direct and how that provision is administered?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_c_jones" startTime="213.069" stopTime="635.026">
            <label>Mr. Frank C. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="213.069" offset="955643">Yes sir, I think of fast statement is that the record indicates that white men were permitted over the years to use authority freely without restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.977" offset="995244">It seems to us that the argument that there with two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.258" offset="1008410">A preeminent park on the one hand and a park only for white persons on the other simply cannot be supported by any fair reading of the language of the will itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.142" offset="1051982">Next, I'd like to direct the attention of the Court briefly to the matter of city control of the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.820" offset="1074657">It seems to us that opposing counsel have attempted to create the impression that the City of Macon somehow round up with a matter to this simple ownership of this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.071" offset="1115617">We say the record not only fails to support this conclusion but clearly shows a contrary was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.855" offset="1142784">To begin with, all though Senator Bacon and the will named the City of Macon as the trustee and authorized it to appoint the first Board of Managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.416" offset="1181027">He gave the city no power or whatever with respect to the operation of the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.379" offset="1200880">Instead, he provided that the seven member Board of Managers which would be a self perpetuating body accepted only to the right of the city to confirm any successor appointment to that board, “shall at all times they have complete an unrestricted control and management of the said property with power to make all need for regulations for the preservation and improvement of the same and rules for the use and enjoyment there on.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.199" offset="1312162">With power to exclude it anytime, any place on all person of either sex and maybe deemed objectionable on whose conduct or character made by said Board be a judge or considered objectionable or such as to render for any reason and the judgment of said board.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.187" offset="1372139">Their presence and said grounds inconsistent with on prejudicial that a proper and law successful use and enjoyment of the same for the purposes here in contemplated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="326.864" offset="1410800">Again, it seems to us that by the clearest possible language Senator Bacon best total control of the operation of the park not in the City of Macon but in this independent group of private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.999" offset="1459388">He authorized the board, furthermore, to use a portion of the property lying to the east of a street man owners North Avenue “in any amount of they may deem best” for producing income to defray expenses connected with the operation management and preservation of the property and in various other way is given total and absolute control.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.052" offset="1543607">The Board of Managers was not made answerable at any way of a city and the city had no authority to remove any member of the board or otherwise to exercise supervision over at in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.897" offset="1586970">The record further shows that the Board of Managers did in fact exercise complete management that control exactly as contemplated by Senator Bacon.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.346" offset="1624795">The record include detailed the minutes of many leadings of the board over a period of 30 years in which the most minute matters were carefully considered and decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.864" offset="1662830">The record shows a city that did nothing without the authorization and approval of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.912" offset="1682996">The serious conduct in interest in Baconsfield were at all times completely consistent with its limited status as holder of the naked legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.199" offset="1720195">In no time that the city treat the property as being “public property” as it has been referred to in the brief of opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.671" offset="1754049">The city did not treat this property in the same way at all that the city treated the 40 or 50 other city parks which won in free sample by city.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.343" offset="1792711">I think an excellent example of this is the way in which the swimming pool has been referred to in this case before it was handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.876" offset="1822908">The land on which this pool was constructed was not in the park proper but in the income producing area lying to the east of what is now known as North Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.352" offset="1864808">The pool was constructed in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.244" offset="1880377">It was constructed on a property that was leased by the Board of Managers to the City of Macon.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.724" offset="1902320">Copy of the lease is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.471" offset="1909217">I think of reference to it clearly demonstrates that it is a standard lease similar to the other types of leases of property and income producing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.354" offset="1944743">The lease capital resides that the premises and the pool to be constructed by the city shall be use and operated in accordance with item 9 of Senator Bacons will.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.374" offset="1984867">And in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board of Managers and it was provided that the board contaminate the agreement in the event of a breach not corrected within five days after written notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.421" offset="2033037">I'll take it a self evident that if the City of Macon at ever --at any time regarded this as being public property in the sense in which that expression has been use in the brief of opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.670" offset="2078072">There would never had been in any such a lease arrangement is that why that with respect to the swimming pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.945" offset="2103150">Counsel has suggested in this case that there is some significance of a special nature to the 1920 deed that's been referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.039" offset="2139512">I think as we've pointed out completely in our brief that that had absolutely no effect upon the nature of the interest of a city.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.600" offset="2173785">It was provided as I pointed out that the charitable trust would not come into being until after the death of the survivor of Senator Bacon's widow and two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.255" offset="2212342">And the sold papers as the record clearly shows of a 1920 deed was to make it possible for the vesting of possession in the city as trustee to commence in 1920 rather than being postponed until the death of the survivor of those three members of Senator Bacon's family.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.183" offset="2300113">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.127" offset="2307845">When this case was here before there was no factual record of any kind before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.135" offset="2331878">There was nothing specifically to show the extend of the city involvement at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.139" offset="2355911">In consequently the assumption is recorded in the majority opinion that it was assumed that there was a continuation of city involvement in the operation of the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.470" offset="2397288">The record mail before the Court is a fully developed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.083" offset="2411708">It shows clearly and without contradiction that since 1964 when the City of Macon resigned its trustee and its resignation was accepted by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.021" offset="2459460">The city has had no involvement of any kind or character with Baconsfield Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.563" offset="2481612">No funds had been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.130" offset="2487881">No city employees have assisted in maintenance or preservation has been absolutely nothing in the way of involvement or a connection by the City of Macon with the operation or maintenance of this park.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.262" offset="2536469">The Board of Managers since 1964 has provided all of the funds for the operation and maintenance of the park using the income produced from the leases of property and the income producing area for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.288" offset="2588505">In 1968 to complete the record on that park, receivers were appointed by the trial court and a continuing to operate the park gestures of the Board of Managers had done part of that time pending the final outcome of this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.411" offset="2989014">Certainly as far as in relations between the city and the Board of Managers are concerned, every action of the city has been consistent with its limited status as trustee and with the recognition of complete control on the part of the Board of Managers.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.252" offset="3212413">Mr. Justice Brennan, that's very difficult to the term when precisely from the record but I was about to make a statement that it appears that at least 50% of the total cost of operation and maintenance found its source and the income produce from the income producing property left by Senator Bacon.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.766" offset="3282422">And the perhaps 50% or less of the total cost of operation and maintenance is attributable to city funds directly or indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.555" offset="3317635">The record as completed this as is simply impossible mathematically to determine the exact percentage of support from the city and from the Board of Managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.428" offset="3361102">In our view of the evidences as to pre 1964 involvement by the city is largely immaterial to the issues that are presented in the present posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.107" offset="3407809">And I mention these facts solely because in our judgment with due respect opposing counsel if greatly over emphasized the extent in nature of that involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.027" offset="3451486">It is true as I have already pointed out that WPA funds were made available in 1935 in connection with the development of the park and cities labor was made available thereafter for a period of perhaps 30 years in connection with the operation of the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.156" offset="3520031">But I would ask the Court to keep in mind as the record shows that this property consists largely of grass and strawberry and trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.358" offset="3552841">Well over 50% out of it or at least 50% is in trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.260" offset="3568410">The only structure of any kind on the property other than in the income producing area to the east of North Avenue is the club house that has been referred to by counsel in the argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.807" offset="3618565">As I mentioned just a moment ago during the same period perhaps a $100,000.00 of income attributable to Senator Bacons own the quest has also been use in the operation and maintenance of the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.025" offset="3667466">We would also direct the Courts attention to the fact that the record shows that in 1920 when the early vesting of possession in the city was agreed upon at that same time $13,000.00 in bonds and interest that had been left by Senator Bacon for this purpose were turned over to the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.097" offset="3755760">And the city agreed to make a 5% annual payment on the $13,000.00 or $650.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.630" offset="3785853">I think this is of significance in the total picture I would calculate that the amount of the principal and interest of the bonds that were turned over to the city in 1920, plus the 5% payments that it was obligated to make went over the year have amounted to about $43,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.205" offset="3856175">So that to that extent that part of the city involvement is attributable directly to funds left by Senator Bacon himself four years in connection with the development of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.397" offset="3896926">That in addition to the about $100,000.00 it came from the income on the income producing property to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.911" offset="3935065">Finally with respect to that evidence, again I'll make the statement that the record never shows in anyway that the city is sole to exercise control in its dealings with the Board of Managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.352" offset="3980831">But instead everything that it did in those dealings was entirely consistent with its limited status as hold her own leave the naked legal title recognizing complete control on the Board of Managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.708" offset="4030255">This case, may it please the Court, has been before the Supreme Court of Georgia on three occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.415" offset="4053034">Twice seems the decision of this Court and Evans versus Newton.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.553" offset="4073618">Shortly after Evans versus Newton was handed down in March of 1966, the Supreme Court of Georgia held at the sole purpose for which the trust was created has become impossible of accomplishment and has been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.563" offset="4145612">This being based upon the decision of this Court and Evans versus Newton that it was impossible for Senator Bacons trust to be carried out on the Court with a racial restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.788" offset="4186572">To respond that held by the Supreme Court that a resulting trust under a Georgia statute was implied for the benefit of the heirs of the testator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.315" offset="4220635">Incidentally, I checked on that statute suggest today and I find that it's been in the Georgia law at least since the code of 1863 which was the earliest available code from my inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.794" offset="4262536">So far as I know, it's purely declaratory of the common law and has been in the Georgia code since the first code was prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.464" offset="4293256">The case was remanded by the Supreme Court of Georgia to the trial court for determination and ask to who were the heirs of Senator Bacon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.747" offset="4326379">In the third and final appearance of this case before the state Supreme Court in December 1968, the decision with respect towards the writ was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.661" offset="4365981">The Supreme Court reiterated its holding that the trust terminated under state law. Noting that petitioners had sought no review of that ruling by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.640" offset="4405896">He held further that the cy pres doctrine could not be applied on the Georgia law and rejected various other contentions of petitioners including all of those urge before the Court yesterday and today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.821" offset="4454693">It held that in short applying state law or trust created under a Georgia will and relating to Georgia property had failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.275" offset="4496488">And again on the state law, the property had reverted to the heirs of the testator.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.124" offset="6511888">We submit, first of all, that all of the petitioners contentions in this case ignore the distinction that must made between the Federal question of the manner in which the park would have to be operated if it continued in existence as a park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.089" offset="6571760">And the state law questions involving the construction of Senator Bacon will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.410" offset="6592972">As we see it, the federal interest of petitioners is simply that if Baconsfield will continued an operation as a park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.550" offset="6621602">It would have to be operated on a nondiscriminatory basis by whoever save this trustee in obedience to Evans versus Newton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.085" offset="6655666">There is no basis in Evans versus Newton as we read it on the other hand or any other decision of this Court for petitioner's argument that there is an additional federal requirement that the state courts must construed Senator Bacon will and an amount of it will resolved in Baconsfield continuing as a park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.276" offset="6728495">When such a construction would be directly contrary to the clear expression of the testator himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.637" offset="6761932">As we understand the proud decision of this Court, the construction of a will and the determination of the matter of reversion or state law questions to be determined by state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.712" offset="6806235">As responded out by Mr. Justice Black in the descending opinion on Evans versus Newton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.960" offset="6827238">So far as I have been able to find the power of the state to decide such a question that of reversion has been taken for granted and every proud opinion in this Court is ever written in touching the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.247" offset="6876348">We ask that the Court keep in mind that this was in its some exceptions Senator Bacons private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.343" offset="6900694">It never became ‘public property”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.395" offset="6912920">It was left and trust for the exclusive benefit of a limited class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.812" offset="6934653">The racial limitation was a product exclusively of Senator Bacons personal social philosophy and not that of the city or state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.455" offset="6973210">As we see it when this case was remanded to the Supreme Court of Georgia by this Court and Evans versus Newton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.880" offset="6998915">The Supreme Court of Georgia had before it two facts that were controlling upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.123" offset="7019813">First of all, this Court that held at Baconsfield could not be operated in accordance with the racial restriction contained in Senator Bacons will by anyone its trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.621" offset="7061817">And secondly, the will itself is clear that he wanted a park operated only in accordance with the racial restriction and not otherwise that was further found as a matter of an interpretation of the will by the Supreme Court of Georgia itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.722" offset="7362226">The Supreme Court of Georgia and we interpret the will not as saying two things but is saying one thing and that is the operation of a park only for white persons and not with the mixing of the races.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.216" offset="7408201">Not to tell what two purpose is one to have a park for whites, and secondly, a purpose that there not be a mixing of the races in the park but a single indivisible purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.189" offset="7444146">And that was a construction and interpretation of the will placed upon it on the state law by the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.176" offset="7476120">Face as we see at with the impossibility of reconciling those two facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.575" offset="7493674">The Supreme Court then held or Georgia held that on the state law that trust had failed and the property had reverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.694" offset="7522200">It seems to us that the state Supreme Court decision had nothing to do with racial discrimination as such because that issue was eliminated by this court and Evans versus Newton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.596" offset="7561801">Holding the park could no longer be operated on accordance with the racial limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.452" offset="7585207">We disagree very strongly with the statement in their brief and I believe Mr. Nabrit repeated this in oral argument that the Georgia decision might be sided, “for the proposition that state court may generally decree reversion of properties for a breach of a racial condition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.236" offset="7656364">It seems to us that by that argument they forget that this should not involve property of pledge to a subject to a racial condition nor doesn't involve property that was originally perfect nor does involve property between public properties in the full sense of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.971" offset="7715297">It was an inception of Senator Bacon's property and it is fundamental as we understand the law that a person who creates a charitable trust may condition the use of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.120" offset="7759809">We do not argue with the testator can require that its property be use in a manner contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.144" offset="7783946">But on the other hand, we do say that this property may not be use in a manner of violating above the expressed conditions or imposed upon the use of a property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.269" offset="7820413">But under those circumstances, there would be a failure of the trust and the property would go according to whatever the applicable law of this state might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.052" offset="7859597">It seems to us further that that contention that Negroes might be discourages by the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court from asserting their rights as a hollow argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.435" offset="7905155">This was not again public property in the usual sense of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.906" offset="7923022">It was trust property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.713" offset="7930232">The use of which was subject to condition set for in the Senator Bacon's will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.462" offset="7949249">As a practical matter furthermore, it seems to us unlikely that there is a similar situation in existence anyway on the country and more over, the Georgia decision could hardly encourage some of the testamentary trust because Evans versus Newton is now the law of the land establishing that first of all a person cannot effectively device all conveyors property to municipal corporation and trust where racial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.657" offset="8049977">And secondly, a municipality cannot accept such a trust to his trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.495" offset="8069308">So, we don't see have a decision of the Georgia Court which is an obedience to that mandate of this court could be set in any respect to encourage similar or racially oriented testamentary trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.610" offset="8121762">As we understand the effect of the argument that's being made by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.710" offset="8142242">They say that the Supreme Court of Georgia or not in applying federal law but in its determination and application of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.757" offset="8174425">I'd like to comment specifically on that in more detailed and just a moment in replying to the argument of Mr. Claiborne for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.421" offset="8209011">Finally with reference to this branch in my argument, it seems to us that the mere recognition by the state's Supreme Court that the trust is failed does not end of itself constitute impermissible state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.398" offset="8264913">The fact that the Georgia Court run to decision which is not in accord with the contention of the petitioners, doesn't mean in and out itself that the state has denied them any constitutionally protected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.161" offset="8316008">As we see it one must have a right before it can be denied and neither the negro citizens nor the whites citizens of the City of Macon have the right on the federal state law to require that Bacons property be use as an integrated park in direct violation of the expressed terms of his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.904" offset="8402944">We don't believe at persons belonging to a particular class or group or religion may create rights simply by setting claims in the state court and having them denied and as we see it that is the effect of the position of the petitioners in the present case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.486" offset="8841279">And that being so, I think their involuntarily removal of the city as trustee would have been held by this Court to have been impermissible state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.227" offset="10700257">It seems to me that Mr. Claiborne yesterday post the question that I suggest must be confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.327" offset="10736724">Isn't it really true as he said that the state statute which provide and in terms of what has actually been done in this case would be pretty obviously on Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.630" offset="10793880">That hypothetical law would say something like this that even if a testator expresses no intent on the issue of reversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.673" offset="10830033">And even if there were no difficulties in administering apart nonracially and even if the name beneficiaries could still get benefit and there benefit was not diminish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.198" offset="10876113">For the charitable trust to the way racial limitation fails if Federal law prevents that racial limitation from being imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.549" offset="10917595">As I hear urge yesterday, I don't think if really can make a difference that the rule have just stated is not Georgia's common law and not a statute law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.117" offset="10963884">The essence of the case I think is simply that Georgia acting through its Courts has chosen to give special emphasis to the racial rule and to destroy a public park and give it away or rather to have it integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.670" offset="11026056">By this decision the state is chosen to regard the racial rule as the essential and to reject the idea that a perpetual park is the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.578" offset="11069733">A park for the benefit of white people is not becoming possible or illegal and this is clear I think, if one accepts the simple proposition the park still benefits white people even if Negroes are admitted to the park at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.618" offset="11129814">And today, if maybe supposed that the Alexander school number three, a public school right across the street from the park is using that playground then white - negro children at that school are playing in the park today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.736" offset="11182268">The judgment stands this will be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.038" offset="11203480">Mr. Justice Harlan asked yesterday, if our position would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.595" offset="11225736">If the testator provided for a racial reverted and I said, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.561" offset="11249664">I think, I should add to my answer that the definitive article on this subject was written by Professor Hilarious Clark in the LRU in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.153" offset="11303999">In that article I think, contains all the arguments that charitable trust are really totally involved in state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.567" offset="11337644">But the case relied on by the heirs, this North Carolina Barringer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.703" offset="11366170">I think, it shows the difference between that kind of case, on the present one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.355" offset="11392815">In that case which is discussed at pages 47 and 48 of our brief, the North Carolina Court had two deeds before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.779" offset="11438477">And one deed had an expressed racial reverted and the Court gave effect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.408" offset="11465017">And we think that was wrong not for the reasons I have expressed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.286" offset="11484557">But the other deed in that case didn't have it good -- it had a racial limitation but didn't provide a condition and the North Carolina Court said, it wouldn't step in and make the racial choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.609" offset="11537847">That's what -- and it said second situation that something comfortable to that second deed in the North Carolina case that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.672" offset="11574105">It's the Georgia Court that stepped in and made the choice that today no park is to be preferred to an integrated park and Bacon really didn't make that choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.763" offset="11862392">That he wanted a park, that they wanted it for white people and they didn't want Negroes in it, that's the purpose of the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.852" offset="11902830">There is no -- their decision was that when Negroes had to be admitted to the park somehow it became impossible to have a park, did become impossible to have an all white park.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.686" offset="11998124">I make to be sure there is a kind of equality created by destroying the park for everyone since before only Negroes were excluded and now everyone is excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.336" offset="12060714">But that kind of superficial equality doesn't for me fulfill the states obligation to afford Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.140" offset="12087881">The equal protection of the laws but we object to it the forfeiture itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.102" offset="12115780">And the message of that kind of forfeiture decreed by state law it seems to me is pretty plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.737" offset="12142320">Says something like this to Negroes, it says that the law honor us a will leaving land to a city for whites only.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.630" offset="12365928">My view is that there were no Georgia cases which clearly determined this that the statute Mr. -- these two statutes Mr. Jones has referred to set out on page 55 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.126" offset="12427891">Our what the Georgia Court was using and if those statutes only have any meaning when the testators intend can't be follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.451" offset="12477210">That's the only time that you use this statutes it is the first one, when a valid charitable be quest is incapable for some reason of execution in the exact manner provided by the testator, donor or founder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.500" offset="12537396">The Court of Equity will carried into effect in such a way as will as nearly as possible effectuate is intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.064" offset="12571669">Obviously, Bacon's will couldn't be carried out exactly as he intended it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.725" offset="12590268">Well, as I understand at Georgia Courts opinion said as I phrase statute didn't come in to play at all because under Georgia law given the provision to Mr. Bacon's will, Senator Bacon's will, there you were selecting the general charitable purpose and my question is, if that holding represent a deviation beside Georgia law?</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.380" offset="12768841">Well, I think that wherever city makes a present political judgment, prudential judgment that it wants to abandon a public facility that maybe done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.397" offset="12820982">However, I think that kind of decision is subject to examination by a proper court as to whether or not to substitute is to whether they are really doing this as a method affording desegregation, for example.</text>
