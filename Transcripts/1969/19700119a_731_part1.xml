            <text syncTime="208.823" offset="938715">And the other two issues involved are due process issues, one having to do with the composition of panel and its conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.680" offset="982079">In fact, the advisory committee that is the University disciplinary committee, its confusion of functions being essentially everything and therefore inherently biased, presumptively biased.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.165" offset="1040071">And I think in this case also biased as a matter of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.318" offset="1304639">However, she testified that she saw him do this some two, three or four months before the leaflet was prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.071" offset="1331702">So, we assumed that there is only witness against him, the president of the university and the president incidentally only testified that he received one personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.878" offset="1378931">He did not see it hand it to anyone else.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.048" offset="1619571">Also at the disciplinary hearing, there was no evidence presented whatsoever of disruption of the campus, eminent disruption, proposed disruption, suspicion to disruption, possible disruption, none, it was just not coming for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.330" offset="1700655">At the hearing in the District Court, there was no evidence of actual disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.873" offset="1734823">The only evidence of possible or prospective disruption was the president of the university is, you know to use the phrase vague and undifferentiated fear just been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.731" offset="1790307">He referred that as inflammatory, get students all stirred up, talking about other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.861" offset="1810787">Oh, there was one other bit of testimony on that, the Dean of Students objected that the students received the leaflet as they're walking across the campus, they would stop and read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.752" offset="1878392">And the case, the disciplinary action was not taken until at least one month after the leaflet was handed out, so that this is not a case where we really need to rely on forecasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.880" offset="1966895">The idea of whether the -- on first issue, whether the void for vagueness doctrine should apply on the campus, I believe is aptly covered on the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.223" offset="2008273">I will only mention here that it just seemed inconceivable that it shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.500" offset="2041396">It seems much more reasonable to me to apply it there where you got the people thinking about things, erudite, literally, scholarly, talented, to write rules than in the small towns that are held so rigidly to First Amendment standards as specificity in drafting their ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.612" offset="2137840">As to what the standard might be, I think the same approach as was taken in Dombrowski v. Pfister.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.994" offset="2171382">Dombrowski referred to the loyalty oath cases as setting forth an appropriate standard for other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.174" offset="2204087">This is really not much of a different context though because we're still on the campus, at least not that much of a different context.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.168" offset="2324041">But on the other hand, the people who were doing the drafting at least at the time and in the context in which they were originally drafting were probably proceeding on the assumption that these students were coming to these institutions to study and to learn, and they didn't give them perhaps the kind of detailed attention they would give them if they were rewriting them today?</text>

            <text syncTime="592.288" offset="2472521">The regulations were revised every year though.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.139" offset="2487881">There were quite current at the time in 1967 and some of the regulations involved on the procedures followed by the disciplinary committee had been rewritten that very year.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.002" offset="2547336">The regulations were rewritten immediately after this case was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.120" offset="2563845">I do not know what the result is; perhaps the opposing counsel can help us on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.891" offset="2618911">And whether we're talking about the facial or applicatory constitutionality of this situation, I think the case does have to be considered in light of what the university is first and it is considerably more than just a group of scholars and learners and second, in light of what is happening in universities today and as obviously, there is much unrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.842" offset="2790693">Various authorities have attributed this to the failure to extend constitutional rights in the universities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.249" offset="5504397">I want to first take care a little matter of the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.412" offset="5521011">It was made in my brief in which it alleged that I had made some erroneous statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.528" offset="5541491">Only two points that I want to raise in connection to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.378" offset="5552880">One is to the effect that I have left the impression at least that the leafleting activity that this petitioner has been charged with and found guilty of was connected in some way with the arrival on the campus, Mr. Carmichael when ensuing riot that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.162" offset="5648071">I am wrong about that and I apologize to the Court and to opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.630" offset="5669909">There had been a number of leaflets passed out at about this time and some of them before and that some after the riot occurred down the campus in the summer of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.817" offset="5730617">There was one of them for instance that demanded that the administration invite Mr. Carmichael there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.266" offset="5756426">They later did and the riot did result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.151" offset="5771995">However, this particular leaflet which advocated and urged the student body to boycott registration at the school was passed out after the riot had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.189" offset="5820165">Now, the second point that I would make in the reply brief is in regard to the charge against this petitioner of being in violation of city county or state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.893" offset="5870947">It is urged here that by the words of Dr. Payne who was the Dean of Students and who presided over these hearings that he agreed that this was not used against the student and the hearings,. The record will not bear Mr. Boult out on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.438" offset="5945135">I think he has failed to read the entire record in regard to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.654" offset="5961958">What actually took place, Mr. Hedgepeth on page 12 of the transcript of the proceedings of the FAC hearing made it clear that we were, or the school was relying upon any disorderly conduct or conduct unfitting a student or any that violated the rule of the handbook there at the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.029" offset="6067493">Further on and about 70 to 78, there were about eight-full pages where it was developed as to just what Mr. Jones had been convicted of and paid the fine in the Metropolitan Court IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.950" offset="6139173">So, those are the two points I want to raise on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.587" offset="6153697">The -- we have made two issues out of the four that the petitioner had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.140" offset="6179924">We feel that there only two things involved, one is the entire matter of the procedure including the due process rights of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.383" offset="6220884">As stated earlier, there were five original petitioners, two of them were dismissed at the time of the hearing, I mean charges against them were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.797" offset="6266546">The other three were found guilty of acts that warranted their suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.287" offset="6292564">Now, that's another thing that I want to make clear to the Court and that is the fact that these students were not expelled, they were suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.209" offset="6332165">They have not -- this petitioner has not gone back to school and sought readmission since the suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.151" offset="6371976">I don't know whether the school would allow him readmittance or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.616" offset="6389844">His was an out of state student and he came down there and he did things that they felt to be and found to be disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.853" offset="6418787">This one piece of literature tried to impress his will upon the other students, for example and calls them not to register for school and thereby disrupt the entire procedure.</text>
