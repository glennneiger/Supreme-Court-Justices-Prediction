            <label>Mr. Arthur B. LaFrance</label>
            <text syncTime="24.377" offset="202961">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.217" offset="218321">Mr. Padnos closed by saying that when he sought was the opportunity to get into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.670" offset="252071">I might begin by saying that that is precisely what the appellant seek in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.806" offset="276626">The appellants initiated this proceeding by bringing a civil rights action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.634" offset="311944">They allege in their complaint that they wished, intended to sue their husbands for divorce in the Connecticut Superior Courts, but that is welfare recipients they could not afford to pay the court cost of approximately $60.00 or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.029" offset="381534">As a consequence, they had set their divorce papers to the Superior Court for New Haven County, with applications asking that court to waive the filing fees and to arrange service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.288" offset="438585">These papers where all set back by the clerk of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.825" offset="460737">Upon received of these papers, appellants then asked Superior Court Judge Longo and after speaking with him, the State Supreme Court Administrator Justice Carter to reverse the position which had been taken by the Superior Court Clerk Edward Orimits.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.134" offset="546001">They sustained that position and as a consequence, appellants were effectively bard from access to the courts of the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.161" offset="582050">They further alleged in their complaint in the District Court that this denied them constitutional rights involving Due Process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.235" offset="634399">The appellee is moved to dismiss their motion with sustain by a -- or granted by a three-judge-panel and this direct appeal was taken to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.730" offset="676300">The question which is thus presented is has Connecticut by erecting economic barriers to its court denied these appellants the rights to Due Process and equal protection of laws guaranteed to them by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.711" offset="756234">If I may turn first to our Due Process contention, we founded upon the right to petition for redress of grievances, a right which is expressed in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and which is incorporated into the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.691" offset="824153">The decisions of this Court in NAACP versus Button, United Mine Workers versus The Brotherhood of Railway Engineers and the United Mine Workers -- I'm sorry, the United Mine Workers versus Illinois Bar Association and the Brotherhood of Railway Trainman versus Virginia, all of these cases are squarely precedent for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.031" offset="925508">The appellees may attempt to distinguish them on the ground that the litigation contemplated in Button was of a political nature whereas the litigation appellants contemplate is of a personal nature, but that distinction was rejected in the Mine Worker's case; a second distinction maybe that these cases involved the right of assembly rather than the right to petition for redress of grievances, but we submit that the language of these three cases discusses these two rights independently and accords to them equal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.677" offset="1064166">The right of assembly and the right to petition for redress of grievances indeed in these cases, their would hardly have been any point to assembly at all if it had not been to unable individuals as here to bring suits on their on behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.341" offset="1130830">This is a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.463" offset="1143265">This Court has said that the right sue and defend in the courts is the alternative of force in an organize society.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.524" offset="1175552">It is the right conservative of all other rights and lies at the foundations of orderly Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.119" offset="1201883">Turning to our equal protection contention, it is clear that the equal protection of the laws can be denied by economic discrimination as surely as racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.222" offset="1250262">This Court recognized that in Edwards versus California in 1941 and as reaffirmed it in many decisions sense most recently in McDonald versus Board of Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.792" offset="1296551">Perhaps the most significant case here is Griffin versus Illinois where this Court held that appellant remedies could not be denied to a person convicted of crime simply because of its inability to purchase a transcript for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.697" offset="1368231">Appellees brief at great length has attempted to distinguish Griffin from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.623" offset="1395921">Appellees have set first that Griffin is a criminal case and that this is a civil case, the present proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.557" offset="1427686">And point of fact, however, this is a distinction which is not recognized by the constitution appears no where in the Equal Protection Clause and was not expressed by this Court in the decision in Griffin versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.238" offset="1478363">That decision dealt not with criminal procedure, but with court procedure, and it is court procedure which these appellants seek to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.781" offset="1512532">A second distinction offered in their brief by appellees is that in Griffin, liberty was involved whereas these appellants are at large to go about as they choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.283" offset="1558507">But in point of fact, the liberty of these appellants is substantially curd by their inability to obtain divorces in the courts of Connecticut and this Court has recognized that liberty consist of more than simply freedom from physical restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.223" offset="1630292">A final point which appellees have made in their brief is that Griffin should not govern here because in Griffin, the state was the participating adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.845" offset="1664773">It was the state which had put Mr. Griffin in custody whereas the divorce actions contemplated by appellants are private matters between husband and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.051" offset="1713674">This however is an elusory distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.123" offset="1729870">It is the state which has bard these appellants from its courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.691" offset="1748156">It is the state which has said to these appellants that they may not settle their marital affairs out of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.004" offset="1777413">Thus on the one hand, the state has required these appellants to go in the court and at the same time has told them that they may not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.310" offset="1806670">We submit then that the state is fully as much as an adversary in this proceeding at it was in Griffin versus Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.750" offset="1892456">Are their quarrels within the form of litigation or not but the divorce matter that is a civil case which can only be decided by a judicial decree and cannot be compromised is that right?</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="493.859" offset="2080852">They could agree to live apart if they were to agree to that which in point a fact most of them have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.552" offset="2111676">What would happen is that they would be locked into marriages which were meaningless, which was barren.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.798" offset="2140620">They would also be cut off from some rather important rights, the right to remarried, the right to appropriate, the right to form new families.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.100" offset="2173848">And this Court is said that those rights are rights of considerably significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.453" offset="2203209">I might also note as we have in our brief that denial of access to divorce for the poor opposes peculiar problems which may not be post for other segments of society because denial of that access aggravates the economic circumstances under which the poor live.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.777" offset="2288577">It may also further weakened the family structure patterns which sociologist indicate are prevalent among the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.164" offset="2334030">Whether or not that peculiar problem for the poor are cognoscible by this Court, it is at least clear that by Connecticut's law, anybody who is cutoff from divorce is cutoff from remarriage and is cutoff from appropriation with anyone other than her legal spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.578" offset="2423683">What we are submitting is that since and in fact these marriages have seized to exist in legal contemplation; that fact ought to be recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.900" offset="6768995">The statute that's under attack in this case, that portion of it, 52-259 excuse me, they shall be paid to the clerks of the Supreme Court or the Superior Court for which civil cost $45.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.400" offset="6842974">That is the entry fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.404" offset="6854990">Now the problem in this case is not particularly the court cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.984" offset="6877351">It's the marrying which cases started at least in Connecticut that client or person goes usually to a lawyer if he has or a person has a case, the writ is drawn, the lawyer gives it to the sheriff or brought a proper officer for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.199" offset="6954256">And the service officer makes a fee, makes a service and returns the writ to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.851" offset="6980796">Now, the fee payable to the sheriff is paid by the client or the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.112" offset="7017890">The state does not enter into that angle of the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.334" offset="7034713">The case is returned to court after service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.857" offset="7048819">Now if they are not arrest in defendants, the sheriff has to go over the court or with the representations affidavit made the lawyer showing the type of service which would most likely reach the attention of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.172" offset="7122066">Very often, that calls for publication and sometimes a series of publications, two or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.602" offset="7155816">So, it was on their basis of these features and many other features that we argued in the lower court that this is matter of legislative action rather than judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.065" offset="7229691">Every state in the union so far as I know including the support of the Federal Courts have entry fees and court fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.490" offset="7263336">They're waived in the Federal Court by a form of pauper statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.946" offset="7285175">That is true to in some other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.150" offset="7294056">They have form of pauper statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.826" offset="7304714">But there are so many factors to be taken into consideration for form of pauper statute that it would seem to me a pauper domain for the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.847" offset="7360825">And then that regard, we mentioned in the brief that in Connecticut right now as of July 1, they've started through the Welfare department of pilot program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.884" offset="7428953">Including in it is a legal services and appropriations for it and last week before coming down, we checked in the progress of this pilot program which is funded by the Welfare department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.094" offset="7493841">It's mentioned in our brief and there' a schedule attached there to showing the appropriations available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.692" offset="7528218">Now that case among other actions they've had through the legal assistance program in Middlesex in County, it's involved and I think three counties, smaller counties to give it a test program, to promote and advocate legislation in the next turn around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.016" offset="7641485">They have six divorces' cases printing since July 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.920" offset="7673145">They are making or negotiating a contract with the Middlesex Bar Association to conduct this because it was not only divorce case and it's not only welfare cases that probably need access to courts, but there are many, many indigence probably who can't afford litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.715" offset="7752244">Some of there rights are waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.418" offset="7767082">The OEO or legal assistance in New Haven has paid for entry fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.949" offset="7793204">They do have appropriations entry fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.230" offset="7806370">They could have well brought this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.825" offset="7816714">It seems to me in one situation bringing the a declaratory judgment in the Connecticut Court give the Connecticut Courts of proper way to pass on this issue in a judicial fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.087" offset="7861750">The Federal Court has held this and another cases that the clerk and the judge who says you can't get in to court unless you pay the entry fee, I have no power to waive the statute, but I can't -- the judicial capacity, we're acting these administrators and the Federal Court says that exactly that that they're acting in administrative capacity when they say they have no power to waive the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.667" offset="7972091">Whether the Connecticut Courts would have done anything on that, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.773" offset="7996541">No one else, they do and I don't have the opportunity to pass on it as a group decided the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.361" offset="8034889">The only issues here are the -- if there is any constitutional problem in this case, it's whether or not the entry fees statute provides equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.411" offset="8103016">It seems necessary to have these entry fee statutes, court cost, if they're reasonable in nature and do not impose an undo burden and no unfair discrimination, no invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.808" offset="8180652">They are arbitrary or harsh, then, the fall has been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.815" offset="8208656">I do not know if this is a case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.109" offset="8221821">There was no other similar situation and this Court has not expanded the Griffin doctrine to situations such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.276" offset="8258497">The civil suit which doesn't have in and over itself for a no state participation whatsoever, it's a dispute between two individuals and this case here, if the judgment was rendered on this case, this is for welfare recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.215" offset="8330282">Hundreds of other people in Connecticut that are indigent can't afford it, but there not welfare recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.960" offset="8357240">The judgment of this case could well revert and reverse discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.876" offset="8380959">That's why we say it's a matter for the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.889" offset="8476985">At Due Process, the parties, the plaintiffs made the same claim in the Federal Court about the Due Process, but Due Process -- this three-judge court didn't even consider the issue of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.321" offset="8534664">I think Due Process is pertinent cases of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.235" offset="8566324">They have the right to go to get into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.377" offset="8578968">The only thing is the condition of getting in is him by a reasonably entry fee as these entry fees prevails throughout the United States or court cost prevailed throughout the United States.</text>
