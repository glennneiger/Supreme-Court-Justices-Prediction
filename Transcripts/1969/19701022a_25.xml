            <text syncTime="37.470" offset="253262">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.445" offset="257128">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.575" offset="273638">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.436" offset="297148">That Court decided that in passing on certain applications to purchase public lands in containing Oil Shale, the Secretary of Interior must ignore administrative actions which became final almost 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.581" offset="357648">Actions which purported to cancel the claims to possession on which the applications were based.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.813" offset="382621">If the clients were effectively canceled, there could be no right to purchase these lands today.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.743" offset="406340">For 50 years, the lands have been available to new claimants, only by lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.903" offset="431000">The statute which made that change.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.218" offset="440195">The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 provided however that existing valid claims could still qualify for purchase under the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.791" offset="478542">Only if the clients were, and “thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="102.448" offset="513128">The old law was the General Mining Act of 1872 and it conferred an exclusive possessory right on persons who made the discovery of valuable minerals on the public domain and then performed certain technical functions on the land and at the local County Courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.534" offset="585540">That claim remained valid for as long as the individual complied with the requirements of the United States Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.895" offset="614902">In particular, the law required the annual performance of $100.00 worth of so called assessment work every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.189" offset="648129">That requirement is the only one under the law that might be thought that have to do with maintaining a claim once it is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.682" offset="678118">In terms, the statute states only that failure to do the work opens the land to relocation by another prospector.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.895" offset="706957">But in my argument, I shall show that the Government too, often re-acquired possessory rights in this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.332" offset="736737">During the 1920’s, the Secretary discovered that assessment work was not being done on a vast bulk of Oil Shale claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.822" offset="766621">At first, he sought to treat any failure to do the required work however technical as automatically canceling the claims and then a case which vividly illustrated the resulting inequities, Wilbur versus Krushnic.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.173" offset="824090">This Court held that that drastic rule is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.645" offset="837987">It left open however the possibility that claims could be canceled by direct Government action during a period while assessment work at last.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.046" offset="875604">The Secretary took that hint and during the following three years, brought actions against over 20,000 of these claims covering an area of over 2,800,000 acres in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.956" offset="931192">To cancel those claims for failure to do the required maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.275" offset="948433">In each of these cases, the Secretary was prepared to show that the assessment work was not being done up to the very moment when he acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.586" offset="977690">And that the Government had physically inspected and posted the claims in reclaiming them much as a private individual might have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.518" offset="1009455">Many claimants did not even respond to the Secretary’s process, not include 75% of the lands at issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.710" offset="1046235">Other claimants responded to the process but permitted the proceedings against them to become final at the administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.943" offset="1075179">That’s the remainder of the land at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.168" offset="1092002">One set of claimants however, had been doing their assessment work up to the very date of the Krushnic decision, and promptly offered to resume doing that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.089" offset="1131708">That case came to this Court as Ickes versus The Virginia-Colorado Development Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.301" offset="1152606">And the Court decided that that offer was sufficient to show that the claimants were maintaining their claims as the statute required.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.475" offset="1189282">In its opinion at page 646, that ask how could the valid claims of the plaintiff be thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated manifestly by a resumption of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.241" offset="1240377">Plaintiff was entitled to resume and the bill alleged that plaintiff had made arrangements for resumption and that work would have been resumed if the Department of Interior had not intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.087" offset="1295757">To my knowledge, that fully distinguishes all the claims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.801" offset="1314565">Now respondents will probably examine the subsequent history in much greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.687" offset="1338075">But let me say this, in the ensuing 25 years, few, if any persons worked the claims as few if any had worked then since 1920.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.013" offset="1383424">I ask Mr. Strauss, if all that’s required to do assessment work, not less than a $100.00 worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="331.569" offset="1429608">That’s it.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.967" offset="1439222">While the Secretary did state following Virginia-Colorado on the basis of language appearing in that decision that he felt constrained to regard his prior decisions as void.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.007" offset="1483421">There were very few claimants who sought reopening or corresponded within regarding this.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.844" offset="1506722">There were 20,000 cancelled claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.445" offset="1517171">In the first ten years following the decision in Virginia-Colorado so far as the record in this case shows, five private claimants wrote to the Secretary inquiring about the status of their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.722" offset="1574222">And it was not until 1950, 15 years after Virginia-Colorado that the first patent involving a canceled claim was issued and that appears from Exhibit 95, plaintiff’s Exhibit 95 at page 148 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.547" offset="1645589">From that year until 1960, patents were issued on only 74,000 acres of the almost 3 million acres of land involved in these cancellations.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.540" offset="1701491">In 1962, in the administrative proceedings challenged here, the Secretary decided that Virginia-Colorado did not require him to ignore cancellations which had become final before that case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.608" offset="1753840">Of respondent’s numerous contentions, only one is properly here that Virginia-Colorado held that the administrative cancellations of the 1930’s were alter various of the Secretary’s authority and hence that their claims survive these proceedings unimpaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.795" offset="1818520">The District Court and Court of Appeals agreed with that contention, it was the only contention those Court’s passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.408" offset="1844955">It held that the old cancellations must be regarded as void.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.308" offset="1860629">This Court granted certiorari in the case on October 13th of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.163" offset="1880064">Thus we find ourself in the situation where a claim to an exclusive possessory right, that’s the claim, it is granted by the statute, made in 1919, may have to be honored today even though for 30 or 40 years the claimants may never have set foot on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.669" offset="1954043">It is the United States which in fact has been the exclusive possessor of these premises for most of this time and which has used the land for many purposes, this is set out in our brief at page 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.498" offset="2005347">Indeed, the Government’s effective possession of these lands has been foreign access of the Colorado prescription period of 18 years even if one starts to count in 1931, or 1932, when it asserted its right to proceed in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.003" offset="2067414">The significance to the case is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.502" offset="2077341">When Congress passed the Mineral Leasing Act in 1920, it shows leasing over private ownership as the preferable means of developing Government land including these minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.620" offset="2121853">It did so in order to avoid monopolization and the sequestration of fuel resources, to assure a commensurate return to the Government and perhaps particularly important today to promote environmental interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.530" offset="2173471">Under a lease, the Government can control the mode of production far more effectively than if this land were in private ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.280" offset="2200534">This factor, indeed all of these factors remain relevant to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.188" offset="2216103">The Mineral Leasing Act as I said before did provide as an exception that claims would be patented, could be reduced to private ownership, if they had been maintained under the prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.171" offset="2260093">But again, it’s the only requirement under the 1872 Act that had anything to do with maintaining a location.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.195" offset="2288201">Once it was made, once the technical requirements of filing the location had been followed out was the requirement that you do a $100.00 worth of work a year on the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.018" offset="2335431">The proponent of that requirement Senator Cole of California told the Senate in 1872 and this is said out at page 13 of our amended reply brief, that the provision was intended and I quote “to ensure good faith in the working of the mines, to prevent there being held by owners an indefinite length of time without working, to require the miner to use a little diligence or exertion in the working of its mine or else leave it subject to a beneficial use by some other party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="588.523" offset="2457475">Of course, if you did make a valuable discovery on the lands you would want to do that work, otherwise somebody come in and take it away it from you.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.405" offset="2493001">The conceptual framework of that process relocation is interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.322" offset="2512645">As it shown by this Court’s opinion in 1005 in volume 104 of the reports which is cited in respondent’s brief at page 10 and which was a principal precedent in both the Krushnic and the Virginia-Colorado decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.975" offset="2571264">The interest which the relocator acquired, required not from the previous possessor but from the United States which had to receive it in some fashion and as we note in our reply at page 14, this Court has frequently acquitted failure to do assessment work with abandonment of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.583" offset="2653706">To this extent, the remark which appears in the Virginia-Colorado decision, that failure to do assessment work gives the Government no ground of forfeiture on abandonment grounds as plainly incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.821" offset="2706683">It may have been correct in that case where 15 months after there was a failure to do assessment work the claimants came forward and said, “we’re going to start right up again” but it certainly was not correct as a statement of general law.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.533" offset="2769481">Now it is true that in general, the maintenance requirements were privately enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.300" offset="2792573">That was because in general, the United States had no need for this land but there are cases in which the Government does want its land.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.215" offset="2828204">It may want to create a national park or an irrigation project.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.504" offset="2849416">And in cases like that, there was an established body of law set out in our brief beginning at page 52 to the effect that the Secretary could withdraw the land from further location and in that circumstance, the assessment work was not done, the Government could retrieve the land for its own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.910" offset="2934993">This is not a small matter either.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.015" offset="2943457">In the recent construction of the Grand Canyon dam, there were over 7,000 of these old claims on the land there.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.432" offset="2985148">The claims which had to be cleared off the land and it was necessary for the Government to go to considerable expense because this Court had said in Virginia-Colorado that it could place no reliance on the fact that the claimants of those lands hadn’t been doing and recording their assessment work as the statute requires for many years since.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.885" offset="3070934">As I say the Secretary did rule in a small but consistent body of law that in these situations where the Government had a special use for land.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.615" offset="3105834">Private planes would remain valid only as long as they were maintained and then they would revert back to the public for the purpose for which the land around it had been withdrawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.501" offset="3205413">The only thing in the prior law that has to do with maintenance is the requirement of assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.850" offset="3230804">There is no other provision of the prior law that says anything about continuing to work the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.689" offset="3294124">Well I think occupancy in continued prospect, at least the continued prospecting part of it might very well be considered as maintenance or assessment work as the Court is aware from the Coleman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.049" offset="3343548">There have been many situations where persons have taken the Government’s land extensively for mineral purposes and actually wanted it for a seaside resort or something of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.955" offset="3579173">People in the Denver office saw these things coming in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.001" offset="4299421">Individual Secretaries by mistakes they may make in construing the law simply can’t forfeit the government’s right in the public lands. We’re dealing with 3 Million acres of public land here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.190" offset="4344142">Today, only 74,000 acres of that land has been reduced to patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.195" offset="4364204">The first of those patents was issued in 1950 and I really think that the Court would have no difficulty in dealing with that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.223" offset="4404224">As I was saying, sometimes in this body of law which permitted the Government to retrieve land which it needed for specific purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.385" offset="4444871">Sometimes, the Secretary used the words assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.800" offset="4458559">Sometimes he just talks about maintaining the claim and respondent say, “Well therefore those opinions didn’t have anything to do with assessment work” But again, the only provision in the statute which in any way relates the maintaining of claim is the provision for assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.741" offset="4534314">There simply is nothing else in the statute relevant on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.664" offset="4554062">Now, in our view the Leasing Act is just like a withdrawal for a national park or a fort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.853" offset="4578826">It reflects the Congressional judgment about how the public lands ought to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.771" offset="4602441">And so, in our view, it gives the Government the same right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.470" offset="4625220">And now, the significant aspect is that that act ended, eliminated the possibility that some private individual could come in to the lands that were affected and put a claim on them, that would end this old claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.688" offset="4690108">Because the Act withdrew not only the minerals, not only the Oil Shale from location, it withdrew the lands themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.907" offset="4719052">Even if you found gold or copper on the land, you could get it only by lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.016" offset="4735457">As we show in our Amended reply brief at pages 9 to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.986" offset="4759280">It seems to us that there are four ways that one could interpret this provision of the 1920 Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.667" offset="4786030">First one could say, that assessment work must be done and as soon as it’s not done for any period of time, however brief, whether or not the Government finds out about it at that time, the land is automatically retrieved for Government’s use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.282" offset="4856456">That is what this Court rejected in Wilbur versus Krushnic and we don’t urge it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.775" offset="4878503">The second possibility is the government’s position in Virginia-Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.266" offset="4900446">That the Secretary could act as a private relocator could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.108" offset="4915806">Where he has a specific need for the land where it is been withdrawn for particular Government purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.027" offset="4939525">He may go on and if he finds land where assessment work isn’t being done at that time, he stakes it, brings an adversary proceeding to cancel the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.099" offset="4983724">The third possibility is what we think this Court said in Virginia-Colorado, which is that the Government can go around periodically and more or less make demands on the holder to these claims to come forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.826" offset="5042657">That was what the claimants in Virginia-Colorado did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.493" offset="5053315">This Court said that they did it and relied on there having done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.420" offset="5073063">The Court said, they wanted to resume their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.373" offset="5084871">They would have resumed their work if the Government hadn’t been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.823" offset="5098663">That is a -- perhaps a very fine line to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.610" offset="5113814">It isn’t fully adequate but it’s certainly better than the fourth interpretation of the statute which is respondent’s interpretation of the statute, and that is that there is no requirement of maintenance at all, that the government has no interest in whether a claimant develops this land or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.682" offset="5174105">When somebody went out in the winter of 1919 and staked 30,000 acres over a five day period, that’s perhaps too large and I think it was -- there were several that were 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 acres over that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.847" offset="5238784">That that was the end of the government’s interest in the Oil Shale on that land and there is simply no way that the Government can retrieve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.796" offset="5266578">The best short comment I know on that position was offered in the house by Representative Taylor in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.544" offset="5289566">His credentials on land issues are impeccable and are vouched for by respondents themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.477" offset="5309315">They made these remarks after Virginia-Colorado was decided in an evident disagreement with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.845" offset="5330735">He said, people have been holding it -- that is the Oil Shale lands for years and years without complying that the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.760" offset="5366366">That is the assessment work law, and without being entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.945" offset="5383189">This is to require than to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.907" offset="5394996">That is to maintain their claims or else let the land revert back.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.095" offset="6075747">This Court clearly enough could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.870" offset="6110856">Respondent’s view of the bill makes it into a good deal more than a savings clause because in their view, it creates an indefeasible possessory right in public land regarding which they have no effective obligation of care, or maintenance, or development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.821" offset="6178670">No such right ever existed under these nations mining laws and respondents can point to no statement and Congress or elsewhere suggesting that that would be the just or desirable way to dispose off our lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.214" offset="6228198">75% of the lands involved in this case would never work on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.387" offset="7160874">Because the transaction is done there, it’s a six year statute of limitations on undoing the transactions, six years has passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.657" offset="7197968">Second as to the period before the decision and it’s the period before 1935, I should think an overruling would permit the Government to rely on a failure to do assessment work at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.060" offset="7279574">I should think an overruling would have no effect on what was done to the land between the date of this Court’s decision in 1935 and the date of its decision overruling the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.136" offset="7335894">But certainly the opinion was there and one can’t deny its presence in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.903" offset="7362957">A more difficult question would arise as to certain claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.323" offset="7388662">There are claims for example, the (Inaudible) claims and the Oiler claims in this case represent about a thousand acres of the land involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.587" offset="7429726">A thousand out of 18,000 acres for the land involved in this case which were rather diligently most of the Oil Shale claims involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.700" offset="7474134">Most of the Oil Shale claims involved here simply want to look that between 1920 and a time in the 1950’s when a speculator came around, brought up shares in them, very small amounts of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.669" offset="7530036">But those that were rather diligently worked and those that show some continuity of title, I should think there might be some equitable considerations involved there which would govern the Government’s use of the failure to do the work even before 1935, this Court has entertained that kind of relief in Simpson versus Union Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.231" offset="7620315">It seems to me a very apt case of 377 U.S 13, page 24 and 25 of the opinion, the Court reserved the question whether when all the facts are known, there maybe any equities that would warrant only perspective application and damage suits of the rule governing price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.550" offset="7705579">We announced today, the Court referred to that opinion again last year in the Donnelly case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.601" offset="7733791">Certainly there are some similar disposition would be appropriate here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.847" offset="8254777">What happened in that case was that individuals had been working their land, continued to work their land, applied for patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.439" offset="8289155">And the Secretary decided on a very technical basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.868" offset="8302843">That in one year, a year after which they continued to work and that which no one took any notice at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.859" offset="8330846">In one year, there had been a lapse on one of the pieces of land and therefore you can’t have a patent to that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.793" offset="8354565">That’s a pretty inequitable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.668" offset="8362088">The Court and the Secretaries generally have avoided canceling public land claims on that kind of basis and the Government doesn’t want to be able to do so in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.402" offset="8404929">I think on that sort of basis, we’d be very happy to have Krushnic continued in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.250" offset="8428335">I do want to talk briefly about this issue of subject matter jurisdiction, that is whether Virginia-Colorado requires the Court to treat these old claims as void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.563" offset="8481625">That was the only issue which was presented and decide -- not presented but which was decided in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.253" offset="8508374">The courts below never had to reach these questions of the administrative practice because they concluded that Virginia-Colorado in itself was sufficient to show that the claims were void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.828" offset="8554663">But we think the contrary conclusion follows very strongly from the fact that the 1920 Act saving clause, authorized the Secretary to patent only certain claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.229" offset="8604296">Those claims which were valid before February 25, 1920 and which had been maintained since that date in accordance with the laws under which they were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.699" offset="8646196">When an application for patent was made, then the Secretary would have to determine two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.707" offset="8666154">First, was the claim valid on February 25, 1920?</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.641" offset="8681932">Second, has it been maintained since that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.485" offset="8697292">And if he didn’t make that second determination, he might dispose off the public domain to a party not entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.523" offset="8721429">In West versus Standard Oil, this Court said, “whereby by the terms of an Act, the Secretary is required upon application of the claimant to issue a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.348" offset="8756746">Congress by implication confers upon the Secretary, the power to make all the determinations of law as well as the fact which are essential to the duty, to the performance to the duties specifically imposed” Here, the duty was to patent lands on which they were existing valid claims which had been thereafter maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.226" offset="8832293">And there obviously was much of a duty to inquire into the question, what constituted maintenance and whether it had been done because there was to ask what was required for validity, and whether the existing claim was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.436" offset="8881089">And this Court recognized that in the Krushnic decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.654" offset="8893942">At page 318 of this Court’s report, it specifically refers to the necessity that the Officer, the Secretary in this case read the law and therefore in a certain sense construe it in order to form a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.355" offset="8952769">And the Court there specifically noted that there was a question left open as to the meaning of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.812" offset="8974608">It said that the question left open was whether the United States could proceed against these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.594" offset="8997700">If there is a form of challenge on behalf of the United States for the valid existence of the claim which was intervening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.066" offset="9027688">And that of course is the precise situation in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.445" offset="9045138">The Secretary acted within the range left open by the Court in Krushnic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.247" offset="9068335">He acted and ordered to determine whether these claims had been maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.812" offset="9086621">On this analysis, the only possible objection to subject matter jurisdiction is the issue of timing, the challenged cancellations arose not out of patent applications but out of contest which the Secretary brought before patent applications were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.308" offset="9148583">And applications need never be made under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.221" offset="9160286">The Secretary brought these proceedings to clear the land while evidence remain fresh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.062" offset="9179617">And that seems to me a perfectly appropriate thing for him to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.593" offset="9193723">Respondents seem to argue that even if the Secretary would have subject matter jurisdiction to consider these issues when they were brought to him on a claim for patent, he had no power to be aggressive about them but that question was settled by the Cameron case as we show on our brief at pages 36 to 37, where the summary of argument in this Court shows precisely the same argument to have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.855" offset="9282748">That case did involve discovery not maintenance, but we’ve already shown that at least at the stage of an application for patent, the Secretary would have to consider both issues under the 1920 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.387" offset="9332903">If I may, I’ll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.389" offset="9368952">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.971" offset="9379297">I shall address my argument to only three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.552" offset="9397582">The first two are the points that I understand from Mr. Strauss’s argument are crucial to the Government’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.868" offset="9422869">First, one of those points is a procedural point and another is a point that goes to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.616" offset="9441886">As I understood him to say on the procedural point that it is the view of the Government that the only question now before this Court is the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.900" offset="9482951">That is to say, did the Secretary of interior have jurisdiction to cancel claims for assessment work as he purported to do on two separate occasions in the late 20’s and early 30’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.900" offset="9534986">We are -- it is our view that that is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.209" offset="9544182">That is that that procedural point is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.133" offset="9551914">It is our view to state it very summarily before development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.803" offset="9566542">The only questions before this Court are precisely the questions that we raised in the District Court, but which the District Court or one of which it did not have to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.106" offset="9611786">In the District Court, we object it, rather sought review of the Secretary's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.033" offset="9635506">Speaking very broadly upon three grounds that went to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.459" offset="9649194">One upon the ground that this Court had held that the Secretary had no jurisdiction to the -- very broadly the medaled and assessment work matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.576" offset="9685661">Secondly, that even if that construction of this Court’s decision in Krushnic and in Virginia-Colorado was not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.803" offset="9718575">Those decisions clearly held that it was error for the Secretary to cancel claims for failures to do assessment work, even if that was not a jurisdictional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.220" offset="9764237">And in the third place we argued, that the undisputed facts as to the course of administrative conduct, from the period of 1935 until the proceedings that ultimately issued in this case here were such that they had those -- that administrative conduct had established an administrative rule which could not be changed retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.333" offset="9856711">Now the District Court having found that in its view, the Secretary under Virginia-Colorado had no jurisdiction as to assess the court matters, quite naturally did not go to the other due points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.087" offset="9911672">The Court of Appeals in affirming the District Court took the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.815" offset="9930585">That is the procedure, so that it is argued that there is no available for consideration by the Court are three alternate and independent positions that go to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.265" offset="9972381">Secondly, we take the opposite view of course that the Government’s position because the Government’s position as we understand it hinges upon its contention that the word maintenance in the saving clause of the 1920 Leasing Act confers rights upon the Government with respect to claims and reference to assessment work that did not therefore exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.696" offset="10070183">I believe in response to question counsel almost said that they construed the word maintenance to meet an assessment work.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="2505.074" offset="10123682">Thank you very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.985" offset="10131310">Thereafter maintained as I understand it, it is the gist of their case that that means that assessment work must be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.217" offset="10160253">We dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.162" offset="10167986">Thirdly and in conclusion, I shall endeavor to establish that even if the question were now open, if you should as we do not but you should but if you should respond to the government's request, to reconsider the Virginia-Colorado case that that case correctly decided that the Secretary has no jurisdiction as to assessment work matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.173" offset="10256071">Before coming to develop those points in some what more detail, if I may, I should like to advert briefly the three aspects of the background that a pertinent, we submit to the consideration of those three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.579" offset="10305703">One has to do with the development in respect of Oil Shale in the early days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.263" offset="10328377">Another has to do with certain broad historical circumstances that relates to the development of the mining laws in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.937" offset="10355127">The place of the Oil Shale question in perspective and the third has to do --</text>

          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2566.700" stopTime="2572.450">
            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="2566.700" offset="10370173">Is the Shale Oil achieved the cause of contention?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fowler_hamilton" startTime="2572.450" stopTime="2853.079">
            <label>Mr. Fowler Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="2572.450" offset="10393161">The sole cause of contention Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.172" offset="10400057">Yes, the lands, the public lands that contain Shale Oil or the some of them, a limited amount that is all cause of contention, yes sir, within that historical background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.552" offset="10453556">Between 1950 and 1920, they develop a great interest in Oil Shale because there was widespread conviction that our country was running out of hydrocarbon energy because of the great draft of the war and because of the great draft upon our requirements it was put by the development of the automobile and the use of petroleum instead of coal and number of industrial uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.029" offset="10535476">An Oil Shale industry had existed in the world since the 17th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.466" offset="10549269">The Scott’s had quite an active one in the 19 -- in the 20th centuries and there was great boom as all sides can see it out on the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.982" offset="10579257">Now, in the Western slope of the continental divide, Colorado primarily some in Utah and some in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.643" offset="10605902">People went out to State and develop these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.880" offset="10614888">This activity continued down through the 1920’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.804" offset="10630562">Prior to 1920, a number of claims were staked for Oil Shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.892" offset="10650937">The development work continued down until the depression in the early 1930’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.142" offset="10679986">Now, coming against that background to the mining laws themselves, and while Mr. Justice Black this case only considered, it deals with Oil Shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.774" offset="10722513">The law that is applicable, it nowhere speaks expressly of Oil Shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.516" offset="10741426">We’re dealing broadly with the whole scope of the mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.258" offset="10756368">And as you will recall, the mining laws are the principle law taken in connection with the Home State Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.756" offset="10782386">Under which approximately 2/3 of the total of 2 Billion acres at the various times our Government has owned has passed from public ownership into private ownership because as the country expanded westward, the Government found itself with increasingly large quantities of public land on its hands and they had a problem of disposing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.468" offset="10861275">The principle law was the mining law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.060" offset="10871620">Indeed, when Gold was struck in California in 1848, President Polk -- we refer to it in our brief, made a great speech about it, and that produced the gold rush at 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.445" offset="10921148">There were no mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.952" offset="10927208">No laws to deal with federal land of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.546" offset="10937553">These miners went out there and they developed customs and they enforced these customs by vigilante measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.838" offset="10958764">All the people who developed the gold in California were trespassers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.034" offset="10975483">The early cases even held that their possessory rights which were developed by custom and enforced by vigilante measures, that the Federal Courts had no jurisdiction over these rival claims because they -- the land belonged to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.103" offset="11027832">The Federal Government didn’t recognize the right before mining the ground on a large scale that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.013" offset="11055417">So the first mining law of consequence, it was perhaps was passed in 1865.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.177" offset="11076106">And the purpose of it was two-fold, the purpose was to get peace and to provide some kind of the federal supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.504" offset="11101393">The only thing it provided as to mining claims was that Federal Court should have jurisdiction of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.608" offset="11125844">Even though the Federal Government owned the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.291" offset="11136502">Secondly, it provided that the law of possession, that is to say the custom of the miners would determine who is entitled to what, in connection with these possessory rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.464" offset="11173177">There was no provision for a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.319" offset="11180596">There was no provision for the Secretary of Interior or any other Government agency doing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.519" offset="11197419">Although the federal land office in the Department of Interior of course have been established back in 1810.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.273" offset="11224482">The next step was a passage of the series of three statutes between 1866 and 1872, and those in essence constitute the framework with which this Court will decide this case as interpreted in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.556" offset="11289579">On essence, what that statutory framework provided was that a claim would be granted, this is the first time there was a reference to the granting of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.465" offset="11333256">Anyone who discovered valuable minerals on the land could comment and state the claim and he got a possessory right which as this Court said in Krushnic, without any action of any Government agency at all, he could mortgage, he could sell, he could dispose off, he could leave by inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.407" offset="11409011">There was not then and there never has been, any place in the Federal Government where you can even find out where these mineral claims are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.696" offset="11442134">The policing of whether or not the claims were developed and how they are dealt with was left solely to another provision of the statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.112" offset="11475780">And that brings us to the assessment work provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.941" offset="11487169">Thus the framework provided that if a man did a $100.00 worth of assessment work on each claim per year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.479" offset="11605243">A claim could only be for 20 acres but eight men could go together and claim a quarter or section of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.798" offset="11638575">Claim a 160 acres and that became a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.726" offset="11650278">If one man located 20 acres, that was a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.270" offset="11664488">But if eight men went in and pooled their resources and that was always done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.722" offset="11682252">They could get a 160 acres and that would be a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.253" offset="11692387">So what the statute said was that if these people spent a $100.00 per claim per year in assessment work, their claim can’t be jumped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.249" offset="11744319">What that meant was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.953" offset="11751215">If they didn’t spend the assessment work, somebody else could come in and locate on that claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="4148.548" offset="16697553">I only wanted one point to touch on and that is, between 1935 and 1961, that is to say, after the decision of this Court in the Virginia-Carolina case, the Department of Interior and we submit that the evidences is uncontradicted the uncontradictable administered these lands as it stated time and time again upon the principle, that the old assessment work decisions were invalid, void, and have no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.211" offset="16844257">As quoted in our brief, the Government’s response to our interrogatories in which they said they had no evidence that any government official had ever taken any act or had done anything on the assumption that these claims were in any way tinged within validity because of the old assessment work decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.198" offset="16932133">Furthermore, we described in detail in our brief the circumstances that show that the existence of these claims did not in any way impair the use of land for public parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.686" offset="16978108">The use of it for reservoirs or for any other purpose, because these claims just like any other claims are always generally accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.727" offset="17014262">Whenever there is a reservation of Government land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.406" offset="17025024">The Government says, “This reservation shall apply only to the public land that is not encumbered by claims” Now as I mentioned earlier, there is no way for the Government to know what land has claims or not unless he goes out and searches the local county offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.495" offset="17093360">So that the practice is always been, whenever a grant is made of public lands for any of the purposes, they are discussed in the Government’s brief to contain a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.229" offset="17128260">For example in 1916, oil shale as it refers tend to be valuable minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.924" offset="17163055">The geological survey said, we do not want them reserved because we want to keep them open for location and grant because we want to have these possesses developed to get the shale out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.380" offset="17208926">The Navy wanted a reservation of oil shale land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.598" offset="17225749">In recognition of the fact that the reservation would not cover claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.980" offset="17243303">They ask and got a reservation of twice as much land as they thought they needed because they anticipated that about half of them would be covered with claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="4549.302" offset="18300531">He did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.006" offset="18307427">Then the solicitor took -- there was no notice to anybody about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.751" offset="18322369">No operative will be heard, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.845" offset="18330728">Then the Solicitor took the cases up, reviewed them on appeal and confirmed his original instruction in a decision called the Union Oil Case which is the one which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.695" offset="18366151">In which he conceded that the -- there was a right of appeal in 1935 to the courts but he held that there had been latches.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.272" offset="18400423">The trial in the court below was solely on the question of latches because we introduced voluminous evidence all from the Government files to show this unbroken conduct where they had recognized the validity of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.597" offset="18453713">In our briefs, we have set forth the number of acres that were patented on page 40 in a map.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.462" offset="18473253">By far the greater part of the land has been patented in Colorado and it’s the big part of the land that’s been patented for oil share was covered by these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.087" offset="18503764">So I don’t think it’s really disputable that there is no latches.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.456" offset="18513168">The District Court found there was no latches, they said there's been a dearth of any evidence and the Tenth Circuit confirmed that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4747.803" offset="19094549">The background of it is this briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.132" offset="19115865">If you recall that the mining laws that I have described which there was a direct grant of a claim went back primarily what's called -- so-called hardrock metals, they came out of the gold rush to California and a hardrock minerals unlike petroleum and natural gas are found characteristically either in loads in which you have a vain which under our law as you know you can follow wherever the gold goes or there are placer claims like those out in the open where you -- like gold in a river bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.147" offset="19227982">In the ‘90’s, the last session, the question came up as to which one of this categories, oil and gas fitted in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.271" offset="19256508">The Interior said first it is patentable as a placer, then the Interior, the Secretary said he didn’t think it was then he finally said he thought oil and gas was and finally Congress confirmed that by saying that oil and gas was patentable as a placer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.354" offset="19320769">Then the question arose because in 1909, oil and gas were going to be withdrawn from further location and the Interior in connection with various withdrawals that it had made, had decided that if a man was looking for oil or gas and was drilling and hadn’t hit it but was still looking, it was unfair to cut him off even though he hadn’t made a discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.649" offset="19413974">So they established the administrative rule that when – in connection with oil and gas, there was a withdrawal and a prospect, he was looking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.896" offset="19450964">So long as he went right ahead and kept looking, if he found it and made a discovery, he got the claim even though as a technical matter under the mining laws, no claim vested until the discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.626" offset="19493909">So this was a kind of a special or quasi or in-court claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.601" offset="19509791">Now, when the Mineral Leasing Act was passed, this question arose in the Congress because they said, the Interior said, “What are we going to do about these different kind of claims that aren't real claims because no discovery has happened?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.489" offset="19573321">so they put in this provision that so long as the oil or gas matter was directed, maintained the claim by going forward to seek discovery, he would be entitled to a claim even though at the time the Act vested, he had not a claim in the proper sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.956" offset="19667153">And the papers that are set forth in the Government’s amended reply brief, we submit make perfectly clear that what Mr. Vogelsang was saying to people on the hill was, if this law goes through without some kind of a saving clause, what are we going to do about this oil and gas leases?</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.891" offset="19738937">The last sentence in the last -- one of those letters, last letter, we think makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.148" offset="19783973">Mr. Senate who was a Congressman in responding to Mr. Vogelsang said, “I do not know that I just understand your reference in the first paragraph on page two to the $100.00 work of a labor or assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.116" offset="19839875">Do you have in mind assessment work under the state laws or under the federal statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.223" offset="19860250">As I understand it, under the federal state assessment work, work is required only after discovery, the point being that you didn’t have any claim in an oil shale situation until you had discovery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.656" offset="19925974">So that when we come against that background, to the decision of this Court in Krushnic and in Virginia-Colorado, we submit that it’s clear that what the court was saying there was that this is a jurisdictional matter in the second case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.097" offset="20003715">The Interior Department only has jurisdiction to do these various things with respect to abandonment of discovery because they have a duty to issue the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.779" offset="20038510">Justice Brandeis in the very clear and recent decisions, its quoted in our brief makes it perfectly clear that the Department originally had no jurisdiction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.860" offset="20078843">There's no statute that gives the Department of Interior jurisdiction to hold or contest proceedings to do any of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.159" offset="20104025">As he points out there, the Department has jurisdiction only where and I think I should perhaps refer to his specific language, only what he said was, “Jurisdiction is conferred upon the Secretary giving him the power to make all determinations of all as well as fact which are essential to the performance of the duties specifically imposed and we submit that Mr. Chief Justice Hughes was saying in Virginia-Colorado, there is no duty specifically imposed with respect to assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.270" offset="20256475">It is only imposed with respect to granting of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.648" offset="20278000">You don’t have to do assessment work to get a patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="5084.416" offset="20441004">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.163" offset="20444035">I take it from counsel’s last remarks that they no longer claim that this Court can pass on these claims as on direct review and so I’ll leave that part of our argument to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.121" offset="20495862">Counsel was just addressing himself to the West case to Justice Brandeis’ as reference to the duty of the Secretary, of course we rely on precisely that same language, under Section 37, the Secretary had a duty to ascertain whether claims were being maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.287" offset="20564511">If they weren’t being maintained, it was in error for him to get patents on the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.923" offset="20595022">When Secretary Fall, the West case involved Secretary Fall, when Secretary Fall had tried to give away Government lands without the right to do so, he wound up in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.930" offset="20647058">The Secretary in this case, in all of these cases, was following his plain duty under the statute to see whether these claims had been maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.112" offset="20683839">Now, Justice Brennan you asked Mr. Hamilton what did that word mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.879" offset="20702856">What might it mean, he kept saying he would answer, he has finally come back with an answer which appears to me to be, well, that word only applied to oil claims, it doesn’t have anything to do with oil shale at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.222" offset="20756250">That may be true in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.992" offset="20771297">As we point out in our brief, the only legislative history which specifically addresses itself to the question, what shall happen to the pending oil shale claims, he says that anyone who has an oil shale claim may trade it in for a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.788" offset="20838484">That is the sole direct legislative history on the oil shale claims in their savings as you may get a lease, the lease was to run for relatively indefinitely but one advantage of the lease was that the Secretary could suspend the payment of any rent or royalty for five years and it was quite clear while that was provided, that was provided in order to encourage people to get the leases and then recognition that people weren’t going to be working on these lands for a while because nobody knew how to make oil from shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.768" offset="20970454">Mr. Hamilton’s clients are working very hard at that but they still haven’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.396" offset="20988949">40 years later, 50 years later, there is still no commercial process in this country making oil from shale.</text>

            <text syncTime="5243.638" offset="21077974">The public policy of the Mineral Leasing Act was to have this and to encourage the development through a lease and there are all kinds of reasons today, environmental considerations, not the least of them, why that should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.025" offset="21127502">Now, there was this limited exception left for people who had valid claims and maintained them and I think if one reads the legislative history, one can come away with no conclusion other then that meant diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.568" offset="21181628">Mr. Hamilton admitted as much.</text>

            <text syncTime="5445.528" offset="21885471">Our case is that a condition of maintaining of maintaining the claim is that you continue to do the assessment work up to a point where the Government may come in and relocate in effect that in this kind of case where the Government wishes land for a specific use whether it be a dam, or a national park, or a national forest or an order to lease it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5492.446" offset="22073135">Indeed, this is a case very much, if these were private individuals involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.800" offset="22094555">I have every confidence that the Colorado courts would say, the Government, it’s taken over these lands by adverse possession and staked them in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.268" offset="22124440">No one else briefed on them till 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.379" offset="22140844">It seems to me incredible that one could have a state of law that said that these claims must be honored today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.972" offset="22171251">There was some discussion of abandonment, there's a remedy for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.166" offset="22188074">The difficulty with that remedy, the practical difficulty with that remedy again is the sentence in Virginia-Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.944" offset="22219107">Before I get to it, I’d like to read some sentences from some other Supreme Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.578" offset="22237706">In Union Oil Company versus Smith, Volume 249 of this Court’s report, the Court said, “The possessory right is lost only by abandonment as by non-performance of the annual assessment work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.538" offset="22293504">In Donnelly versus United States in 228 U.S., the court said, “Of course under the mining law, a claim may be abandoned by failure to do the required development work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.939" offset="22335091">So up to this point, the Government, if it could show that assessment work was not being done, might have some kind of remedy if it called it abandonment, in Virginia-Colorado, we find a very different sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.815" offset="22394650">That sentence says, “The Government gained no right by the failure to do assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.143" offset="22423907">The failure to do assessment is no evidence of abandonment.”</text>
