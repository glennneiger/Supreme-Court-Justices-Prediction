            <text syncTime="18.232" offset="176253">I will conclude argument for the respondents in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.677" offset="202062">I would like to call the Court's attention to an article written by Professor Charles Allen Wright in connection with speech to be delivered on Vanderbilt University campus on October 1969 entitled “The Constitution on the Campus.”</text>
            <text syncTime="42.507" offset="273429">This is one of the Oliver Womble Holm series and I think that it is one of the best written articles I have ever read and I recommend it to the Court if they haven't already seen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.175" offset="320031">In it though, Professor Wright basically wound up by saying that expression can be restrictive, if at any time, if material substantially interferes with a normal procedures of the university or with the wraps of other.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.252" offset="392338">Now, it is our contention that the basic issue involved here is just the action that this student has been accused and found guilty of committing based primarily under his First Amendment rights.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="97.263" offset="492440">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.978" offset="495261">There was a finding that he had committed a misdemeanor and found guilty in court in violation of the student handbook which had been a specific charge against him in addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.663" offset="542072">They also found that he lied to the committee while before ti and openly before it and I might say this, it is not only just, he just told the president of the effect that he was lying in front of this outstanding faculty group and other students and even the press was present when this happened which compounded the disrespect that he showed to president on this occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.906" offset="639039">Yesterday, I had the feeling that there was some question in the mind of perhaps Associate Justice Marshall in regard to why this action on the leafleting or the boycott literature didn't result in any kind of a serious incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.724" offset="706226">I didn't called the Court's attention to this but I would like to do it this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.231" offset="728273">Mr. Jones at the time that he passed out this leaflet had already been temporarily suspended from school.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.106" offset="755754">He was not on the campus at that time as a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.521" offset="773413">When he passed out this literature he was awaiting his hearing to see whether or not he would be admitted in the full term or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.372" offset="808835">This literature was passed out on August 18, 1967 which according to the calendar which you have in the appendix in the student handbook part of it which begins on page 175 of the joint appendix, a calendar of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.986" offset="895352">Here, you'll find that this was the last day of final examinations for the last term of the summer quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.055" offset="923564">When he did this, the baccalaureate services follow that by two days and school was out then until the following term started.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.165" offset="964002">That is the reason there was no more commotion following it.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.105" offset="975809">However, I direct your attention to the fact that this was followed -- itself following by just a couple of weeks or so, arrived on the campus and tensions were high.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.741" offset="1022307">Now admittedly, the faculty hasn't in it's findings written out that as a result of this literature been passed out on the final examination day that John Smith came to him and said, “Well, that bothers me and I couldn't correctly answer one of the questions on the examination” or anything like that, but they found it as a matter of their interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.608" offset="1121782">They were there on the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.757" offset="1130350">We're not talking about some rural constable or something like that that might be found in my home county of Pickett.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.632" offset="1161906">We're talking about nine of the outstanding members of the faculty on Tennessee State University's campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.319" offset="1192626">We're talking about the vice president Maritus (ph), who was the Chairman of the Faculty Advisory Committee with 30 some years of experience there as a school administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.394" offset="1232959">We are talking about Dr. J.A. Payne who acted because of Dr. Boswell's poor health as the presiding officer over this faculty advisory meeting with the great many years of experience on the campus and as being the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.976" offset="1291264">We're talking about the dean of women and the dean of men.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.369" offset="1308818">School administrators, practically all if not all of them hold doctorate degrees and had the combined experience of well and in excess of 100 years there on the campus, that's who we're talking about, substituting the judgment on as to what --</text>

            <text syncTime="340.633" offset="1465866">I think you could perhaps of even gone across the street a little ways to centennial park and got up on a bench and maybe made a speech on it and it would have been somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.052" offset="1503587">Here, it is calculated to do one thing, calls unrest and tried to prevail his ideas and his desires on to the student body there.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.944" offset="1551130">He had already been suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.376" offset="1556877">He -- it wasn't a matter for him not to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.011" offset="1567431">He was trying to ask everybody else to join with him because his conduct had caused him to be suspended where he wasn't permitted to continue during the summer quarter and was called on them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.408" offset="1612988">Now as to the type of thing that was in this makes very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.388" offset="1628975">There was really more to it than just boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.801" offset="1638588">So far as it being designed to create unrest and we got to keep in mind now that this was fall on a period of great deal of disturbance on the campus where property was destroyed and people were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.240" offset="1696371">Some of the things that he says for example anything that give the puppets, I'm talking about school administrators now.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.556" offset="1729599">That's a reference that he makes to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.367" offset="1736808">He calls them puppets throughout this.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.964" offset="1747257">I want to adapt civilized tactics used by the man and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.146" offset="1779963">Then he goes on with words like “does the campus will become a concentration camp controlled and contained by the legislation of the raciest dogs' downtown.”</text>
            <text syncTime="429.854" offset="1822804">The acts of the puppet administrators here at the end referring to these people for whom he had already been advised that he was going and have to come and clearance have with before he could be re-enrolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.485" offset="1873272">The Billy clubs and guns of Nashville's raciest cops and ultimately the gestapo tactics of the honorable National Guard whose pale faces have already been seen in Memphis, Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.268" offset="1928443">We as intelligent black students will not be guarded by trampling parialist idiots who call themselves administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.566" offset="1961671">Now that's what he's saying about the school administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.197" offset="1976195">He said earlier that he came down to Tennessee to go to school because he investigate and found that it was a great school and he wanted to go down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.608" offset="2005765">Yet in his first year there an 18-year-old boy, he conducts himself in such a way and has the all that has come out with something like this and talking this very school administrators whom he had chosen to go to earn an education.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.329" offset="2060727">And he closed it then with this article and counts and brought and bribed heavy counts.</text>
