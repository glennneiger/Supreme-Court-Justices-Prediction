            <text syncTime="46.503" offset="289416">This case involves the question of whether equal justice under law means for adults only.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.443" offset="349184">Clarence DeBacker is in the Nebraska State Reformatory as the result of a petition files against him in the Juvenile Court of Dodge County, Nebraska alleging his delinquency because of the uttering of a possession of a forged check within intent to utter as genuine.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.662" offset="466004">A jury trial was demanded and denied because a Nebraska Juvenile Court Act says that juvenile delinquency cases will be handled without a jury and a quantum of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.866" offset="542804">Habeas corpus was sought in the Court of General Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.594" offset="565791">It was denied and the Nebraska Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision, it was a type of decision where the minority prevailed, held that the Nebraska Juvenile Court Act met federal constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.761" offset="646457">Nebraska has a state constitutional provision requiring a concurrence of five judges to declare a state statute invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.944" offset="683133">The position of the appellant in this case has been referred to by some of the adversaries and amicus curiaes as being simplistic and, without the evil connotations of the word, it is precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.438" offset="789086">Since this Court’s decision in Duncan, in Bloom, in Gault, a proceeding where a person can wind up in a penal institution for more than six months surely has all the attributes of a serious felony case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.938" offset="5123114">Second, I suppose then it requires the judge to search his mind and determine what he’s going to do with the child and there, frankly, I have difficulty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.647" offset="5486007">If the Court please, first of all, I would like to point out that the reference to the young lad DeBacker being in the state reformatory, that he is there under a transfer statute which is not involve with deciding whether or not there should be a jury in juvenile cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.806" offset="5594572">This is a transfer statute where the young man is transferred after a hearing at corny, and I maintain that the method to attack this is to bring a habeas corpus at the penal complex to decide whether this transfer statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.160" offset="5675969">This is a separate matter that should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.913" offset="5687045">The only thing here is whether or not the trial of the young man in County Court or in the Juvenile Court need be with a jury, and the fact that he was eventually transferred to the men’s reformatory doesn’t have anything to do with this jury question.</text>
