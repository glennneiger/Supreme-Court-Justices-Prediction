            <text syncTime="26.854" offset="210840">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.213" offset="228185">This matter is before this Court upon direct appeal on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on the opinion of that court from the divided opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.911" offset="278967">Chief Justice Haynesworth dissenting holding that statutory scheme for the imposition of capital punishment in North Carolina in light of the opinion of this Court in United States v. Jackson is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.796" offset="350542">Therefore, the issue before this Court today is the import and impact of the Jackson opinion upon the laws of the State of North Carolina, the laws of our sister states and of the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.137" offset="439881">On the evening of November 22, 1963, Nathaniel Young, a Negro gentleman who operated a house that could best be described as a party house in the City of Winston-Salem, North Carolina opened -- responded to a knock at the door, opened the door slightly and was cut down by a shotgun blast.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.021" offset="575404">Earlier that evening, petitioner or actually the appellee in this case Henry C. Alford, had come to that house.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.318" offset="616678">Henry Alford also is Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.785" offset="630471">He had been accompanied by a white girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.355" offset="652831">They purchased several drinks of liquor by the drink which under North Carolina Prohibition Board -- Prohibition Laws is not legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.959" offset="695254">And then Henry Alford gave Nathaniel Young his last dollar to rent a room in that house.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.185" offset="740080">Alford was accompanied by his girlfriend into that room and after several minutes, they left because Henry Alford no longer had any money.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.385" offset="812910">He demanded that this young lady leave with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.247" offset="828374">Daniel Young, the proprietor of this house said, “She could stay here if she wishes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="188.968" offset="859199">An argument ensued and Henry Alford run off with the lady’s coat being chased by Nathaniel Young and someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.169" offset="900054">Approximately, 15 to 20 minutes later, there was a knock at the door and Nathaniel Young was cut down by a shotgun blast.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.489" offset="945298">Alford was indicted by the grand jury of the White County Superior court for murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.418" offset="973093">Counsel was appointed. Counsel thoroughly investigated the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.693" offset="994095">Counsel contacted every witness named to him by Henry Alford except one by name of Jack who cannot be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.068" offset="1023666">In each case, the testimony of Alford’s purported witnesses was contrary to Alford’s allegations as to their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.641" offset="1081971">Upon the call of the case, Alford through counsel entered a plea of guilty to murder in the second degree which under North Carolina Law carries a maximum punishment of 30 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.160" offset="1148008">He did not plead guilty to the capital offense which under the law been in state would have carried a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.625" offset="1185834">He pled guilty to second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.218" offset="1212270">The State then placed on the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.021" offset="2635421">We then contacted Ruby McGill where Alford had been living and Ruby, as a consequence of an interview with her, said that she and Henry have been living together for some three years that they were at this address about five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.641" offset="2693935">So Henry left around dark stating that he’ll be back for a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.821" offset="2710653">That about two-and-a-half to three hours later, he came back and stated that he was breathing hard, appearing to have been running and stated, “G.D.S.O.B. has been running me, I’m going to kill him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="664.061" offset="2759659">She stated that at that time, he said “Nathaniel Young” and that he kept and he repeated that a couple or three times that he was going back and kill the S.O.B. and the other fellow with him also.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.516" offset="2809396">She stated that he got a shotgun out of the wardrobe and four shells.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.289" offset="2824547">That she and Shirley, it’s another woman who was there at the time, asked him not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.543" offset="2841579">They told him that there were no use in that and said that he kept repeating that he was going back and went out the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.479" offset="2877315">We talked to Betty Jeanne Robinson who stated that she was on the porch of the store at 1202, 10 1/2 Street which is little better about half a block from the home, the direction of Nathaniel Young’s home.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.633" offset="2925902">And she stated that she and Paul Hill, was standing on the porch and Henry C. Alford came by them with a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.321" offset="2956622">In her statement to us, Ruby McGill stated that after he left with a gun that he came back and approximately 30 to 35 minutes and stated that -- said, “Honey, if I don’t kill that Nathaniel, I’m going to leave you with the furniture.”</text>
            <text syncTime="725.805" offset="3006568">She said, “You don’t have no business killing any man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="728.806" offset="3018585">And he said, “Yes, I killed that G.D.S.O.B.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.904" offset="3031019">I’m not going to have anyone to kill me.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.944" offset="3039169">I went to the door and when I shot him, he just turned his head around and fell on the floor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="741.248" offset="3068322">Officers’ testimony continues, while we was attempting to pickup Alford in regard to this, we went to the home of Sidney Lucky who leaves down a couple of houses across the street and we first went to his house around 11 o’clock and asked him if Henry had been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.189" offset="3128090">He said, after waking him said that he had come in there and told him if the officers come looking for me, tell them I haven’t been here.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.828" offset="3170722">And I talked with Sidney later and he stated, that after we left, he went out and found Alford and asked him why we was looking for him and he told him he shot a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.726" offset="3222235">And the testimony continues here with another witness that they found, a young lady with whom Alford had drinks later that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.283" offset="3248462">And that they went out and he bought her two drinks of whiskey which he paid a dollar and a half for that he asked her for her address and her full name.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.154" offset="3408018">It was also presented that this original hearing upon the tender of the guilty plea, the testimony of Shirley Wright, who was the young lady’s girlfriend who was in the house at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.846" offset="3462771">And she states, “After he came in and got the gun, I left.”</text>
            <text syncTime="844.319" offset="3480639">Well, I’ll describe exactly what happened when he came to get the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.812" offset="3494640">Well, when he come and got the gun, I had -- went to bathroom and I come out and he had got the gun. You know and he said, “I’m going to kill that blank.”</text>
            <text syncTime="856.863" offset="3530794">So he didn’t say who and I didn’t ask him.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.390" offset="3540929">I just told him, “No, you know, don’t do it” That’s all he said to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.607" offset="3557752">So this was what was tendered to the court by the detective at the time of Henry C. Alford’s tender of plea of guilty to second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.837" offset="3622745">He then took the stand himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.874" offset="3634866">And as it appears in the record, the night that he -- he have not shot no man.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.655" offset="3666004">But there from the circumstances they say, “I’m guilty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="896.772" offset="3690454">He was sentenced to 30 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.274" offset="3704456">Approximately three months later he filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the North Carolina Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.703" offset="3730160">The North Carolina Court of Appeals rejected the petition for writ of certiorari but remanded the case to the Superior Court of White County for a plenary hearing under the North Carolina post-conviction hearing at.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.390" offset="3788884">In due course, with court-appointed counsel, the hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.836" offset="3806751">And the post-conviction judge found that the tender of the plea was really involuntarily made.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.767" offset="3846457">Several weeks later, Alford filed a petition for writ of mandamus with the Clerk of White County Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.403" offset="3876968">The purpose of which, I’m really not sure and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.686" offset="3894105">The next step was the filing of an application for writ of habeas corpus with the Clerk of United States District Court from the Middle District of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.846" offset="3942797">The court dismissed the petition at that time because Alford was not within the jurisdiction of the court but within a week or two he was transferred to a prison unit within the jurisdiction of that court and the court reinstated the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.169" offset="4012074">Subsequently, the Honorable Eugene Gordon, United States District Court Judge for the Middle District of North Carolina entered an opinion denying habeas relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.852" offset="4054810">Forty-eight days after the entry of Judge Gordon’s order Alford filed notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.112" offset="4087829">He also filed an additional writ of habeas corpus directly with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.744" offset="4114369">A panel of the Fourth Circuit held that the court did not have jurisdiction due to the late filing of the notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.859" offset="4158777">But that in additional application for habeas corpus had been filed originally in that court and Chief Justice Haynesworth of the Fourth Circuit entered an order concluding upon the original application of that court that Alford’s plea of guilty was really voluntarily and understandingly entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.881" offset="4254908">Alford subsequently filed yet another application for writ of habeas corpus with the United States Court -- District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina and Judge Gordon once again reviewed his contentions and denied relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.798" offset="4330559">From that denial, Alford once again appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in reviewing that application concluded that the statutory scheme in North Carolina for the imposition of capital punishment was unconstitutional in light of the United States v. Jackson, the Jackson decision having been decided in the interim between Judge Gordon’s denial of habeas relief and the filing of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.483" offset="4501295">Until 1949, in the State of North Carolina, upon a conviction of a capital crime, the four capital crimes are murder, rape, arson, and first-degree burglary, the death penalty was automatically imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.949" offset="4575169">In 1949, the legislature amended these various acts to permit a jury to recommend mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.193" offset="4612159">And upon that recommendation, the defendant would be sentenced to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.099" offset="4635773">In 1953, yet another statute was passed 15-161 which provided that upon the tender of a plea of guilty to a capital crime, in writing and represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.353" offset="4704737">If that tender is accepted by the Solicitor of the State and approved by the court, then life imprisonment would be mandatorily imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.257" offset="4768371">In view of that scheme, the Fourth Circuit concluded in light of Jackson that the North Carolina Statutory scheme was invalid and held that Alford who have tendered a plea to second-degree murder was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.810" offset="4854575">Early this year, the legislator of North Carolina repealed N.C.G.S. 15-162.1, the provision permitting the entry of plea of guilty to a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.478" offset="4909328">It is of interests to note at the present time in North Carolina, there are 11 defendants under sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.097" offset="4947780">These 11 commenced from sentences of death initially imposed in February of 1963 to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.283" offset="4992502">From February of 1963 to March of this year, prior to the repeal of the statute there are six defendants under sentence of death.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.202" offset="12804159">Now, I suppose that if he is truly guilty and the State is wiling to let him get off with an assault charge that maybe the fear of the death penalty really wasn’t the motivating force in his pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.541" offset="12881586">And maybe there wasn’t -- if the State is wiling to accept that lower degree of the included offenses, then the State probably don’t have a very good case for obtaining a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.163" offset="12967999">I’d like to emphasize that this Court in all of its -- in most of its decisions on the question of the retroactivity of a constitutional principle has established that in any case, even though a particular constitutional principle is declared to be perspective only in its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.144" offset="13075937">Any defendant who cans show that the facts of his case actually show an abuse of due process is entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.826" offset="13118673">For example in the case of Davis against North Carolina, this Court held that Davis’ confession was in fact coerced even though the Court had just held that Miranda and Escobedo were not retroactive and the Court held that the principles established in Miranda and Escobedo were relevant to the question of whether or not Jackson’s coerced confession was in fact coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.786" offset="13242493">Now this is a case of a coerced guilty plea and it seems to me that the principle laid down by the Court in United States v. Jackson is relevant to the issue of whether or not this guilty plea was in fact coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.119" offset="13319816">And in this record, it seems to be no other conclusion one can reach then that the defendant pleaded guilty in order to escape the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.051" offset="13363597">He has never, this is so far as the record shows, ever admitted his guilt to anyone not even his attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.487" offset="13669334">And the record shows that it took a great deal of persuasion ever to get him to plead guilty that it was -- that his attorney approached his sister and his cousin who was a policeman and that they prevailed upon him to plead guilty because the attorney said he couldn’t win the case and because the attorney said that the facts were aggravated because he’d been out with the white woman just before the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.599" offset="13821785">I’d like to say a few words about the retroactive effect of United States v. Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.911" offset="13858983">The principles which this Court has set out in determining retroactivity are the purpose to be served by the new standards the effect of reliance by law enforcement officials and the effect of the decision on retroactivity on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.401" offset="13941008">Now in -- one of the more recent cases on this subject Desist against United States, the Court pointed out that the purpose to be served by the new constitutional rule is paramount and that only if the purpose and this is not clearly dictate retroactivity or non-retroactivity do you go to the second, and third points the reliance factor and the effect on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.773" offset="14058454">Now in this case, under North Carolina law, in order to avoid the coercive nature of the capital punishment provisions of the statutes, you have to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.195" offset="14112162">You may not have a bench trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.545" offset="14121566">You have no choice but to completely waive your right to a trial at all which means if you waive your right to a trial, you waive your right to have your guilt proven by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.028" offset="14167437">You wave your right to cross-examine and confront your witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.437" offset="14193142">You waive your right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.946" offset="14207143">Now, if the fact is to considered in determining on whether or not a constitutional principle is retroactive is whether or not the defendant has been deprived of a fair trial, and whether or not the new constitutional principle really purifies the fact-finding process of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.906" offset="14323022">Now if the right of counsel is important enough to be retroactivity, then surely the right to any trial at all is important now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.542" offset="14365550">And its very possible, it seems to me that in the situation where a man with the first grade education is told by his attorney that he can’t win the case and that the facts are aggravated and the jury are therefore not going to be favorable towards his position, that he may very well plead guilty when in fact he is innocent because he is being force to gamble with his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.632" offset="14481951">And it seems to me to be a real possibility of a danger of an innocent person being convicted under this sort of coercive statutes.</text>
