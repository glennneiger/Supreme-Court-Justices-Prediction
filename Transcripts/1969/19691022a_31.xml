            <text syncTime="69.938" offset="383143">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.660" offset="413968">Case number 31 Brockington versus Rhodes today is an election case on appeal from the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.032" offset="451480">It’s a case that we feel as this Court has said deals with matters closed to the core of our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.641" offset="501948">It follows a case previously decided by this Court under the title Williams versus Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.851" offset="538728">The Williams versus Rhodes case dealt with the right of third parties to attain ballot status in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.666" offset="574046">This case deals with the right of independent candidates to obtain ballot status in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.657" offset="622007">We think the case itself raises two main issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.539" offset="649488">The first issue arises in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.686" offset="662131">Ohio allows independent candidates to secure ballot status through the filing of nominating petitions signed a certain number of qualified voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.163" offset="723989">Now up to 1952, that number was 1%, that number was 1% for 60 something years.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.908" offset="758993">In 1952, the amount was increased to 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.941" offset="783130">Now, under the 1% rule which had existed for 60 something years, there was no substantial, no disruptive interference with the election procedure by independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.251" offset="832345">In fact, participation by independents was slight perhaps even minimal in the Ohio election process.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="190.784" stopTime="198.873">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="190.784" offset="866513">Was that 1% rule applicable across the board all independent candidates for any elective office of the state?</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="207.066" offset="931610">Your client is a -- wanted to be an independent candidate for election to the House of Representatives.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin B. Sheerer</label>
            <text syncTime="212.330" offset="952717">Yes sir that’s correct, for 21 first congressional District State of Ohio and in November 1968 general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.843" offset="994722">Now we say that given that history of no disruption, no substantial interference, no overburdening of election process, the increase, the sevenfold increase in the requirement constitutes a burden on First Amendment, freedoms, a limitation of First Amendment freedoms of association and speech and a burden on the right to cast an effective ballot, a right to participate equally in the election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.591" offset="1117706">Now, the second main issue we see arising is the barrier itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.356" offset="1136828">In our case, for example, my man, Mr. Brockington, the appellant here would have had to secure 5,974 valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.642" offset="1189909">Now as a rule of thumb, any politician will tell you this means get 50% more.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.603" offset="1213733">In other words, he would have had to obtain 9,000 signatures most likely of which perhaps 6,000 would be valid in order to qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.540" offset="1249573">Now a party candidate qualifies for the primary for being on the ballot in the primary by simply securing 100 signatures if it’s an office less than statewide, or 1,000 signatures if it’s a statewide office.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="300.386" offset="1304952">Yes, but then, in order to appear on the ballot in November, he has to win a primary election and get a majority of the people voting on the primary.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.439" offset="2029171">We think that not only through comparison or disproportion of a 100 signatures for instance approximately 6,000 here but also of the election of the barrier itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.885" offset="2074937">The election of the 7% or now the 4% being offense to the equal protection clause is violative of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.661" offset="2105971">The equal protection clause as in the election area deals with fundamental rights and the classifications that might limit or restrict these rights are carefully scrutinized and closely confined to whatever might be determined to be a necessity of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.556" offset="2185592">Now, the particular facts in which these case arise are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.255" offset="2204400">As has been noted, my -- the appellant was an independent candidate for the Twenty-first Congressional District in November of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.354" offset="2240763">His petitions were good and sufficient except for the signature requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.367" offset="2260825">The number of signatures required.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.271" offset="2276498">When he was turned down for a ballot position, this suit was filed for mandamus against various officials of the State of Ohio having to do with the election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.126" offset="2327907">The theory of the suit was this, from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.017" offset="2343476">We have urged in this case that the 7% requirement was unconstitutional as violative of First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.137" offset="2383914">This being so we said, he does say as prior to 1% requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.824" offset="2402617">The 7% requirement being unconstitutional, the thing to do is to certify him for the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.921" offset="2431039">He met the 1% requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.631" offset="2437935">The amendment to 7% being held unconstitutional is void and have no effect, the 1% requirement is in effect and he should have been given ballot status.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.804" offset="2482552">Now, at trial, the trial court agreed that he met the constitutional requirements for the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.350" offset="2516720">Essential facts of the case are admitted on the record in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.400" offset="2544933">The trial court seemed to indicate and it believed that only the legal issue remained the constitutionality of the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.279" offset="2572518">Nevertheless, in its opinion it ruled against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.917" offset="2583071">Its opinion to me can best be described as opaque.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.721" offset="2598222">I’m not sure what the basis of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.684" offset="2610134">Appeal was promptly taken to the Court of Appeals of our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.931" offset="2627062">We made several attempts to get on the ballot at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.630" offset="2637928">We asked for a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.317" offset="2648691">That was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.762" offset="2654438">By this time, this Court had acted in the Williams case and it had placed Governor Wallace on the ballot in Ohio depending upon the determination this Court made.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.715" offset="2694248">We suggest that the Court of Appeals it do likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.441" offset="2705115">That is if Mr. Brockington want a suit there, he would be on the ballot, if not, he is to be blocked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.838" offset="2726745">That was denied us.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.403" offset="2740955">We brought the decision of the three-judge District Court in a Socialist Labor Party case, the Williams versus Rhodes case to the attention of Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.060" offset="2775646">Nevertheless, they ruled against us without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.434" offset="2793096">We then went to the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.010" offset="2803440">We obtained the prompt hearing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.797" offset="2810546">I think it was October 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.175" offset="2820054">This Court had just decided the Williams versus Rhodes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.973" offset="2839280">I brought that case to the Court’s attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.872" offset="2854849">Nevertheless, that court and before the election dismissed on our appeal sua sponte as involving no substantial constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.862" offset="2898840">We took appeal to this Court, probable jurisdiction was noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.902" offset="2922977">Now since that time, the Ohio legislature has reduced the percentage to 4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.381" offset="2956936">I’m here to urge today that the 4% requirement is unconstitutional that this Court should still act in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.065" offset="2983581">That the case requires decision and that the appellant deserves a decision from the court on these important issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.152" offset="3047946">Now throughout this case, to my mind the appellees have refused to deal with the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.108" offset="3083786">We challenge them in the courts below to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.401" offset="3092982">I don’t think they have done it at any point.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.978" offset="3107297">Now, my conclusion is they have not and for this reason that the 7% increase was patently unconstitutional and is unconstitutional and that the 4% requirement is also unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.361" offset="3172812">I say this for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.162" offset="3180022">First of all, the 60-year history -- the 60-year history of an election system is running without problems under a 1% requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.408" offset="3389001">And there is no request for general declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.997" offset="3415333">I was wondering if that quite a part from the fact of the statutes now have been amended to reduce the requirement from 7% to 4% quite apart from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.660" offset="3453994">I was wondering if this isn’t moot just by reason to the fact that the relief you ask is now impossible to be accorded to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.289" offset="6668518">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.668" offset="6686072">We would first of all like to point out that the appellees in this case have suggested the element of mootness in this case and of course that is now pending for your decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.760" offset="6738422">We feel very strongly however that in the event, in the unhappy event, that this Court might want to rule upon the constitutionality of our election statute which is under consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.593" offset="6793697">We do recognize the fact that when the Court rules, it affects whatever rule that -- or whatever piece of legislation may then be in effect and consequently feel would have an effect upon our 4% statute which is going to be effective some eight days and today on October the 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.138" offset="6863914">Notwithstanding, we would like to ask for some silver reflection on the basic law of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.537" offset="6905501">The appellant initially came in to the trial court seeking the extraordinary remedy of writ of mandamus to commend the respondent board of elections and certain state officials to place his name on the ballot as an independent candidate for election to Congress as United States represented from the 21st district in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.476" offset="7013230">Mr. Brockington had failed at that time to comply with the existing statute requiring that he file nominating petitions signed by not less than 7% of the number of electors who were voted for governor in the next proceeding general election in that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.309" offset="7084596">He had filed petitions which are slightly in excess of the 1% which would have been the requirement under the former statute which preceded the 7% statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.675" offset="7126079">In Ohio, by statutory definition, a writ of mandamus commenced the performance of an act which the law especially enjoins as a duty resulting from the office, press or station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.171" offset="7188041">In addition, our state law places a burden on the relator to establish a clear legal right to have the writ issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.872" offset="7226911">So implicit, that Mr. Brockington suit was a requirement that he showed the unconstitutionality of the 7% statute such that the court would be correct in reinstating the 1% statute and therefore granting the writ of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.355" offset="7296815">Now the record will show that at the trial court level, there was no evidence introduced supporting our contention of unconstitutionality of the 7% statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.931" offset="7351045">The essence of the evidence was simple that Mr. Brockington had filed petitions with signatures consisting of about 1% rather than the records at 7% and that the respondent board of elections had denied certification because of the insufficiency of the petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.145" offset="7419904">Nothing more, this was the entire thrust of the evidence which was heard at the trial court in Cuyahoga County in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.387" offset="7464939">It was at that time, and for I know it still is, the rule in Ohio that before, that an act of the general assembly is presumed to be constitutional, and before a court made it very clearly constitutional, it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt the legislation and the constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.059" offset="7563577">Absent in appearance of such incompatibility in the evidence of the record in this case, it was not unreasonable that our state court should find that no substantial constitutional question existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.362" offset="7612792">And now it’s made that rather than being an opaque determination in the court -- in the trial court, it was quite clear that really they had not carried the burden of showing that he had a clear legal right to the remedy which he ask for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.438" offset="7685099">In Ohio, the basic philosophy underline the enactment of a statute requiring independent candidates to support the candidacy with petitions subscribed by a certain percentage of electors whether to be 1% or 4% or 7% is that we feel that for the best exercise of the democratic process, as a matter of principle that a candidate for any office be required to demonstrate that this is not the frivolous injection of its personality and publicity of a political campaign but rather in fact that he is seeking election to that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.343" offset="7832743">It is not unreasonable that he be asked or required rather to show some marked demonstration of support from at least a fraction of the electorate within the area from which he seeks election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.441" offset="7885093">We believe that such a requirement is necessary to establish a bona fide intent on the part of the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.907" offset="7911006">And in this respect we are supported in our belief in the knowledge that some 44 sister states have some form of similar requirement and either greater or lesser degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.332" offset="7956668">In actual fact I believe there are 11 other states which now would require a greater degree of percentage than does Ohio in view of its 4% statute coming out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.613" offset="8709831">But as you know that the deliberations are not now set out as they were formally in 1852.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.041" offset="8747551">We believe the requirement of showing some bona fide intent upon the candidate really to be in the best interest of the voter and quite frankly, we believe it to be supportive of the one man, one vote principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.688" offset="8814111">In that, the voters are short that when he cast his vote for candidate he was qualified fro the ballot, his vote will be in effective expression of a preference for a candidate and the vote would be undiluted in its relationship to all other votes cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.921" offset="8883075">Since he will have voted in behalf of a candidate of proof and intent, now we freely admit that our statutes do distinguish between the independent candidate and the candidate who is running for a party nomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.477" offset="8937305">And as I pointed out previously I believe a party candidate is required only to have 100 signatures on his ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.085" offset="8971682">But we consider that the reason for this distinction lies in the difference, in the path of the party candidate must follow as opposed to the independent candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.479" offset="9013269">The party candidate is put to great time, expense, although he lays his principles on the line, on the issues which may be before the people of that time and certainly in Ohio party primary fights are very difficult time for the candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.257" offset="9096443">We feel that to proscribe a parity between an independent and a party candidate would in effect be discriminatory as to the party candidates and this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.195" offset="9148165">But this is not really the issue that’s been raised in this case because the appellant certainly in his briefs openly subscribes to the 1% requirement and this of itself is a greater demand of the independent then it would be of the party candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.496" offset="9213367">Its only complaint why is the degree of the burden that may be cast upon the independent candidate and he really fails to tell us what increment beyond 1% triggers off the avalanche of unconstitutional invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.948" offset="9287137">He would ask this Court to determine some magic figure of percentage and to oppose upon the State of Ohio and quite clear the other states would be affected by this, this Court’s ideas of what that policy might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2499.935" offset="10103097">I do not believe that a candidate for office has to be able to show that he can win.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.029" offset="10131519">The three-judge federal court in the Socialist Labor Party case pointed out that the right of free speech is the right also to be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.673" offset="10162030">And we said that anybody that manifests a degree of sincerity about this candidacy is entitled to be on the ballot and it does not matter whether other people might consider that candidacy frivolous or pointless whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.473" offset="10225246">It’s part of our basic framework of our society that everyone is entitled to suffrage and to offer themselves as a candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2539.579" offset="10261713">Well did I understand you say before that there is no prohibition against the so-called sticker or write-in candidate under the present law?</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.518" offset="10305494">That was achieved by the Williams-Rhodes case in the three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.553" offset="10333602">That is right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.550" offset="10341543">So this candidate, your client could be a write-in candidate in any election for any office, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.197" offset="10380204">Yes, sir with the exception of -- if you are running for president, he would have to -- well now, Ohio requires filing of declaration intent to serve shortly before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.690" offset="10418134">Let me point out that Williams and Rhodes notes that write-in is not a comparable to ballot status that Mr. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion points out it’s a disability, the majority opinion points out that it cannot be compared and that is a definite disadvantage to a candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.618" offset="10509876">The reduction of 4% in the Ohio legislature came after this Court and noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.225" offset="10544253">The guideline -- the only guideline we are advancing here is when that history is offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.969" offset="10563271">History has pointed out the guideline in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.546" offset="10585527">Let me point out also this is not a case where the legislature is failed to act as was the case in the reapportionment cases where the legislature failed to reapportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.486" offset="10621367">This is a case where the legislature is acted twice in Ohio and against the interest of independent candidates and minority party candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.916" offset="10663058">This is a case that particularly requires to relief that this Court can require, can give.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.060" offset="10683643">There are no independents in Ohio legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2648.484" offset="10697331">This could be argued that this is not necessarily legislation against or hostile to bona fide independent candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.172" offset="10744038">In my own experience and observation in this very state that’s where I grew up there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.154" offset="10763995">There are such things as people who pretend to be independent candidates when what they’re really looking at for is personal advertising or aggrandizement and they are not bona fide candidates and as the ballot has filled up with people like that with so-called bed sheet ballot of the candidate, of the kind that used to have in Detroit, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.514" offset="10845393">It makes it more difficult for a bona fide or true independent candidate for public office to command the attention of conscientious and responsible voters, isn’t that true?</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.449" offset="10905161">In Williams and Rhodes, the Court spoke of it as a remote danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.976" offset="10927313">Nothing in the case that it does exists and cited on Mine Workers case from Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.065" offset="10947584">He is saying that these rights cannot be infringed on a speculative danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.676" offset="10974124">I think that the intelligence of the legislature is equal to that sort of problem, if it became a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.717" offset="11002232">There is no indication whatsoever that it was or will become a problem, and I would hate to defy bona fide candidate for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.952" offset="11067225">I think that probably an attack the Court should take this one noted in Williams versus Rhodes, the parties have to begin, people have to begin somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.132" offset="11107871">There should be allowed a free and equal chance to engage in a competition of our electoral process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.359" offset="11396786">This Court is the defender of individuals, minority rights and it looks when these people’s rights are burdened or restricted; it looks to the interests that the State is against it.</text>
