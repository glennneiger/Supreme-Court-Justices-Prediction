            <text syncTime="50.277" offset="304462">The principal question presented in this case is one that is entirely familiar to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.304" offset="340616">It is the question which this Court has wrestled with frequently, for better than 35 years, whether in a state criminal proceeding or in this instance a juvenile delinquency proceeding resulting in a sentence of life imprisonment, a defendant's confession was inadmissible in evidence because involuntarily obtained by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.170" offset="468093">This case arises prior to the cutoff date of Escobedo and of Miranda.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.481" offset="525249">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Armsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="108.214" offset="536221">The issue of admissibility of the confession is entirely the traditional one of voluntariness and for that reason it turns on all of the factual circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.561" offset="593586">It is for that reason that in our brief I have tried you set forth in all of the detail that the Court might wish, the exact factual circumstances under which the confession was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.290" offset="656488">As I understand the state's position, in its brief, it initially asserts that it agrees with all of petitioner's factual statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.588" offset="713749">However, in the argument portion of its brief, it does make certain factual assertions with which we are in disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.191" offset="756172">There are half dozen of those and I mean to advert to them specifically in my presentation because I think the most important aspect of this case is the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.295" offset="812596">We begin with what is clearly a major factor in the case and that is the petitioner's age.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.230" offset="856273">At the time of his detention, interrogation and confession, he was a 15-year old, to be exact, 15 years and four months old.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.113" offset="907786">The state of course does not contest that, but it does make three factual assertions in that regard which I wish to bring to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.545" offset="953553">First, it characterizes the petitioner as above average, and indicates that he had an intelligence beyond his mere age.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.602" offset="1001827">The state sights nothing in the record for either these propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.069" offset="1023666">The Court will find nothing in the record to support either of these propositions and as I take it, it is an inference of the respondent to run from nothing other than the fact that the petitioner managed the hold out for a goodly time under sustained police questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.236" offset="1104332">The second factual matter raised by the state in connection with the petitioner's individual characteristics is that he was as the state puts it, court wise or already placed in its brief a hardened juvenile criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.132" offset="1179878">Again, the record shows no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.808" offset="1198582">The facts in this regard are set forth in our brief at page 46 in the footnote 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.431" offset="1225122">The trial record here shows only that the petitioner previous to this detention and interrogation had been a probationer of the juvenile Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.390" offset="1264933">It does not show what caused him to be a probationer of juvenile Court and it does not show what context, if any, he had had with the police incident to becoming a probationer for juvenile Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.782" offset="1314461">There are however psychiatric reports in this record, one of which we advert to in that footnote which shows that as of a time three months prior to his detention, the only run ins that he had had with the police were a minor pilfering incidents, stealing flashlight and jacket from a car, a broken window incident and some misconduct at school.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.769" offset="1414457">In reviewing the record for this argument, I notice that I omitted from that footnote that the same diagnostic report also indicates a charge of waywardness, whatever that may be, some time prior to 1953 when he would have been 11 or 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.069" offset="1487600">Again, no indication is to whether he had dealings with the police in that connection and for the sake of completeness, I simply want to bring to the Court's attention that there's another psychiatric report made later after his present juvenile commitment in which under Sodium Amatol interviews and a Methedrine interview at the state diagnostic center.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.956" offset="1583208">The petitioner also adverted to two additional contacts with the police, however, this came out under Amatol.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.609" offset="1617795">It is quite unclear what these contacts were and there is no objective verification of this Amatol material.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.869" offset="1650813">In any event, he hardly has shown by this record to be a hardened juvenile criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.358" offset="1672756">Finally, the state says that the petitioner was and I quote “familiar with the ability to take refuge in silence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="408.608" offset="1737853">That is a carefully phrased statement to the extent that it seems to assert that there is anything in this record showing that the petitioner knew anything about his privilege against self-incrimination or his right to resist police questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.594" offset="1789785">It is again totally unfounded in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.929" offset="1807130">The only material cited by the state to support it is a statement that at one time the petitioner was in fact totally silent during five minutes of particularly sustained police questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.890" offset="1878915">No indication that he knew of his right to maintain and retain that silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.493" offset="1901380">So, I think what we end up with in terms of the personality in nature of this petitioner is that he was simply a 15-year old boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.744" offset="1938369">I cannot honestly claim that there is anything in the record indicating that he is subnormal, but I think there is certainly nothing in the record to indicate that he is super normal in any regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.684" offset="1982151">We turn then to what happened to this 15-year old boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.109" offset="2007855">First, it is undisputed that prior to the interrogation which lead to his confessions he was detained without access to friends, family, or an attorney for a 10-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.812" offset="2074624">Now, I am quick to admit that this detention has none of the aggravating trappings, that have sometimes attached the cases coming to this Court, no shuttling around from police station to police station in that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.396" offset="2132929">He was simply detained in the juvenile home and he was questioned by the police on four occasions; one, immediately after his arrest then several days later after an intervening weekend when the police detention on him focused in connection with these cases, then as soon as a lie detector expert could be gotten and finally, several days later on the day in which he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.071" offset="2231672">The important thing however, about that detention, there are I think two important things about the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.044" offset="2259571">First, it shows a very considerable callousness on the part of the police and the juvenile authorities and indicates that they were far more concern with their investigation than they were with this 15-year old's welfare and that of his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.155" offset="2328012">He had been away from home prior to his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.022" offset="2339506">His mother had called the police and had called the juvenile authorities and she had made continuing inquiries of them and had been assured that as soon as he was picked up he would be brought home.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.991" offset="2387362">In fact, when he was picked up, he was detained for 10 full days and his mother never learned that he was in custody until the newspapers printed that he had confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.970" offset="2435218">Now, the state suggests and here is the fourth matter on which we are in factual disagreement that the reason why Monks never saw his parents during this period was that he didn't want them.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.390" offset="2484955">Again, the record has absolutely no support for this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.906" offset="2507003">It seems to be an inference from the fact that at the time of his arrest he was living away from home.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.250" offset="2532394">However, as I have indicated, his mother had made steps to find him both through the police and through the juvenile authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.091" offset="2563741">They knew that very well and never got into touch with her, but if it were so that Monks was so far from his parents that he felt that not even that, not even his mother and his father could be called to help him in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.957" offset="2639182">It seems to me that speaks not strength and not a factor which supported this boy in his ordeal with the police, but rather the converse.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.963" offset="2691218">Passing from that aspect of the continued detention to another --</text>

            <text syncTime="679.205" offset="2820159">The most important result of that 10-day detention is that in fact and to petitioner's appearance, he as completely subject to the will of the police throughout that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.650" offset="2882017">He was not being detained for some fixed time after which he would appear in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.785" offset="2902497">In fact and as far as he knew the police could hold him and question him whenever they pleased until he confessed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Armsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="762.792" offset="3154526">Yes, he was arrested in connection with two unrelated purse snatchings to which he admitted immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.621" offset="3181902">However, he was being held from all appearances for questioning on these offenses because the police officers had their attention called immediately to a similarity of modus between the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.227" offset="3228296">And on the Monday following the Saturday of his arrest, they began to question him on these two particular offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.472" offset="3253269">They applied to the juvenile Court for leave to do so, they were granted leave to do so and they began to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.725" offset="3274271">Now, here we come to perhaps one additional factual matter in which we're in disagreement with the state because we believe that the implication to him was obvious, that he simply had no right to refuse to answer police questions and that the police would persevere in holding him and questioning him until he broke and confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.105" offset="3351803">The state asserts in its brief that the police in fact gave petitioner warnings of his right to remain silent at one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.572" offset="3393703">The state citation to support that assertion refers entirely to a warning given after the petitioner had been questioned on three days and during 12 hours on the 3rd day without any warning or caution of any sort from the police at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.352" offset="3488789">It is undisputed that he was never given any warning throughout the interrogation until he had twice orally confessed to the offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.815" offset="3530585">At that point and just prior to the formal transcription of statements, he was told we are going to ask you to make a voluntary statement which you may make or you may not make as you please and that is the sum total of the warnings on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.588" offset="3581680">I want to make absolutely clear that he did not know and was not told at any time anything contrary to the clear indication presented by the police continual questioning that he simply was going to have to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.429" offset="3637060">Now, I come then to the final critical date and time is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.609" offset="3677811">At 7 am he was up, before 7 am he was up because he had breakfast at 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.143" offset="3699963">At, 10 am police questioning began.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.416" offset="3713024">The confessions were completed and signed at 1 am the following day, 15 full hours after the interrogation began.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.751" offset="3754402">Now, during this time, he was -- no, for one minute out of the presence of two or three police officers except when he was being interrogated by a polygraph operator, never, during these 15 hours did he see or speak to anybody other than his interrogators.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.189" offset="3836113">The actual amount of direct interrogation of questioning of him is unclear as it always is in these cases, but by the police admissions, the minimum possible time that he could have been under direct questioning was six and a half or seven hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.275" offset="3904449">And that account of the time leaves several unexplained gaps in the day as is invariable with testimony regarding to these -- regarding matters of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.631" offset="3945932">What is very important is that this record makes clear as no other record I have ever seen in this Court, what was going on throughout the 15 hours because it is misleading to imagine that only six and a half of that or seven of that involved investigation or interrogation?</text>
            <text syncTime="977.678" offset="4014059">The point is that throughout the entire 15-hour period he was subject to the stresses and pressures of the interrogative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.581" offset="4045720">While he was not being questioned, he was being confronted with his friends who were brought in to say that he had made admissions to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.232" offset="4076335">They were undergoing polygraph testing while he waited outside the room to see what the result of that testing would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.501" offset="4101413">He was driven around to the scene of the offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.077" offset="4119698">He was told to sit and wait while the police officers left him, went across the room and in his presence discussed what they were going to do next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.141" offset="4167973">All of this time he was undergoing ongoing process of police interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.843" offset="4190751">So that the 15 hours I think have to be seen as a block under which this 15 year old boy was subjected to the interrogative process and all of its pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.089" offset="4243728">What is equally important is that he persisted from the very beginning in denying these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.503" offset="4281344">This is not one of these threshold confessions by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.559" offset="4297644">The inquiry here is whether he voluntarily confessed, whether he willfully confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.715" offset="4326275">Now, for two days of questioning he did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.267" offset="5076407">Was there anything in the description given by this woman before her death, before she died that links him up with the attack?</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.496" offset="5157386">Again, all of these matters here are detailed in the appendix to the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.109" offset="5179852">The follow up is simply this, that petitioner did in fact have a black leather jacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.365" offset="5204825">The victim's description was a man, and this is a 15 year old boy, in a -- now, it's unclear what she said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.852" offset="5238784">The officer first said she said dark leather jacket but then remembered that somebody had said she said brown leather jacket, Monk's jacket was black and the jacket was equally tainted by the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.541" offset="5281520">The jacket was disclosed immediately following the confession under Wong Sun, there would be no question whatever that the jacket would fall so that the only follow up again derives immediately from the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.913" offset="5331048">When I speak of there being no independent evidence of quilt, I mean no independent of this, both the telling admission and the jacket fall with this confession, but in any event, the probative value of the defendant having a black jacket and the victim saying that she was hurt by a man with the dark jacket is virtually no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.267" offset="5404400">Now, what in fact happened throughout the course of this interrogation was that the defendant simply refused, resisted any efforts to get him to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.450" offset="5441181">He was during this 15 hours subjected to confrontations by friends in connection with the Wise matter, put on a lie detector nine times, was confronted with a prior admission in the Wise matter being knew that it was snowing on the day the Wise offense and was subjected to every kind of blandishment by the police that you can't fool God type of questioning, that you will feel better for it, the sit me corner and search your conscience type of thing and as I say on and off questioning by the police and then the lie detector and back to the police and back to the lie detector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.126" offset="5595826">Now, I come to Mr. Justice Stewart's question about the probation officer because I think that this case would so clearly be a case of coerced confession, it wouldn't even be up here, if it weren't for the probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.361" offset="5644831">What the Court below, both Court's below seem to have done is to rely exclusively on the presence of the probation officer to distinguish this case from Haley, and as I read the respondent's brief almost exclusive reliance is placed on the probation officer there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.822" offset="5702614">So, the question narrows down to this, whether where the interrogation itself which the probation officer was present at and did not stop, clearly makes a case of coercion under Haley, whether his mere presence doing nothing changes the result and somehow makes the confession voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.937" offset="5783071">Now in that regard, I have several specific factual points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.877" offset="5798849">One; the probation officer was simply not there during the critical times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.079" offset="5827688">Although, he had been instructed by the Court to be present when the petitioner was interrogated by the officers, he seems to have construed this as not including the polygraph operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.029" offset="5871470">With the result that the three and a half hours of interrogation that went on, on the 26th alone, the critical day alone by the polygraph operator during one of which he finally broke and started to make the confession the Giambra confession, these were sessions where the probation officer was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.549" offset="5949524">When he finally did break, who was brought in?</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.874" offset="5962898">Not the probation officer, but the investigating detective and he then proceeded to make his initial confession to the detective again out of the presence of the probation officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.947" offset="6235199">Let me make that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.223" offset="6240214">The state Courts below made no such express findings and could not on this record have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.722" offset="6258291">What the state courts did was simply to rely on the fact that he was assigned by the Court and was sometimes there as making his confession voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.088" offset="6291728">It made no findings that he had any impact on the police and indeed no findings of that sort could be made because he never said a word, never stopped the police from doing anything, never interjected, there's no testimony by the police that they regarded him as a restraining influence in short, he was simply there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.875" offset="6358915">More importantly, the petitioner was never told that he was there to protect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.761" offset="6382425">He knew that he was a probation officer but a juvenile's view of a juvenile probation officer clearly allies him with the police and there was no suggestion communicated to Monks that he was there in protective role.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.108" offset="6659845">At one point there is a leading question by the court as to whether the petitioner does not know that these juvenile probation officers are there to help juveniles and the petitioner says yes I know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.741" offset="6706343">But if it wasn't this probation officer or anything else, now that is simply the juvenile court mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.253" offset="6728391">I think this Court need attach no significance to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.845" offset="6742706">It certainly doesn't communicate helping him in what way and the respondent in this court asserts that he was not there to help and support in refusing to answer questions or assert his privilege if he felt like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.998" offset="6791398">The respondent rightly points out that we have great concerns for the probation officer's role here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.607" offset="6825775">We think that he was heedless at the least of his role and possibly mendacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.703" offset="6842180">And I say that not quite comparing his testimony with that of the petitioner, but by comparing his testimony with that of the police officers who sometimes testified that he was under interrogation three or four times as long as the probation officer admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.667" offset="6894007">And by comparing his own testimony internally which shows total heedlessness of any protective role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.667" offset="6922010">The question then Mr. Justice Stewart I think is that not whether any protective figure may prevent a confession from being involuntary, but whether the presence of a figure who does nothing make to stop clearly towards a police questioning, who is not known to the petitioner and to be there in a protective role and who serves no function as an impartial observer in any way, prevents and otherwise coerced confession from being found coerced, we submit that it does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.021" offset="7127437">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.105" offset="7147813">If the prefatory statement made today by counsel was all that there was to this case, I am frank to say here and now that the state would confess error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.044" offset="7203506">But he very adroitly and I'm sure very skillfully has kept the most important, distinctive, significant fact of this entire case for the last factor and only when questioning by the court has brought it forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.860" offset="7298800">The most significant fact in this case and which makes this case different from any others was anticipated by Justice Stewart when he said have this Court ever decided a question involving a juvenile where the confession was made in the presence of a court assigned representative and counsel evaded it and said so far as he knows, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.515" offset="7413426">I would like to call to the Court's attention the fact that since I have written this brief, I've made further research and I would like to help the Court on this -- in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.522" offset="7469432">In my brief at page 7, I referred to the New York statute which provides for the notification of a parent or other representative before a juvenile who has been arrested may be interrogated I have found that there is a similar statute in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.326" offset="7556681">It is ARS, Title 8, Section 221 and construed by the Arizona Supreme Court in 1966 in 420 Pacific 2nd 281, where the Court held that when a juvenile is arrested it is the duty of the arresting officer to notify the probation office at once and a probation officer is assigned to him and stays with him and the Arizona Supreme Court has held that this rule does not prevent the police from questioning a juvenile, it only prevents them from subjecting the juvenile to formal interrogation without permission of the person appointed and that it is consistent with the rehabilitative process of the juvenile court and to see that he is prevented from overzealous pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.933" offset="7831071">Without such a statute in New Jersey, the juvenile court judge in this case, in 1957, made such an order and I would like to give the Court very briefly the chronological factors in this case which I regret to say counsel did not give the Court and they are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.881" offset="7950921">This juvenile was arrested on February 16th by the Patterson police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.422" offset="7981014">He was taken to the police station and I might say a prohibitive practice under New Jersey law but notwithstanding, the juvenile confessed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.642" offset="11277981">First of all, to allow interrogation, and to prevent overzealous pressure, to see to it that the interrogation was fair and that he was not tired, deprived of refreshment, rest or relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.239" offset="11356348">The right to interrogate this juvenile granted by the juvenile court did not require that the probation officer act as his counsel, tell him what questions to answer, and what questions what not to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.368" offset="11424893">The fact is, that during a particular law when the proceedings, when the detectives went to the other part of the room and were conferring about things and trying to piece together various things that had already been developed, the probation officer sat alone with this juvenile and he said to him Willie, he says, I don't want you to say anything to these police officers unless it's the truth and I don't want you to worry about this because let your conscience be your guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.823" offset="11578702">I see nothing wrong about this kind of advise to a juvenile from a probation officer because bear in mind that even up until the first decision of this term -- of this Court -- by this Court in this recent case involving the Nebraska statute on juveniles as to whether there was a right of trial by jury which this Court did not deem necessary to decide, Justice Douglas in his opinion said that the juvenile Court is still setup for the purpose of rehabilitation and has not yet become a Court for the trial of juvenile criminals and in 1957, the viewpoint whether good, bad or indifferent was clearly consistent with that policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3943.175" offset="15876054">Mr. Kreiger stated initially that during the 10 days, the boy was being held on those other purse snatching, he then admitted in effect that that was not so.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_g_armsterdam" startTime="3961.432" stopTime="4083.428">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Armsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="3961.432" offset="15949093">He was taken into custody, correct, but as Mr. Kreiger has stated, New Jersey law would leave unclear whether he should be released under that situation and the clear implication here is that he was held because he was being investigated for the Wise and Giambra matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.225" offset="16004263">Secondly, Mr. Kreiger's statement that the boy was estranged from his family and that that explains to Mr. Justice Marshall why the mother wasn't called.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.098" offset="16039790">The mother had contacted the police two or three times, the juvenile authorities more asking that this boy be brought home when he was picked up and both the police and the juvenile authorities knew that and the parents were not contacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.201" offset="16096214">Third, in response to Mr. Justice Marshall's question about whether he was told about the probation officer's role.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.828" offset="16126725">Mr. Kreiger has said that he will file something responsive to that, I think the Court will find at pages 200 and 201 of the appendix all that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.227" offset="16160266">It supports my statement that he knew that the probation officer was a probation officer, had been assigned to “Stay with him” and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.154" offset="16196002">Finally, -- no, two more points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.439" offset="16205093">First, Mr. Kreiger's statement as to what the probation officer told the boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.248" offset="16224319">This is on page 90 of the appendix and this is supposed to be good probation officer advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.836" offset="16250755">I took advantage of one of the respects in questioning, one of these episodes to ask the boy that if he really knew anything about these offenses that he should unburden himself and search his conscience and that he would feel much better if he told it because he would have to live with it the rest of his life, the sort of counseling I would give any boy in the juvenile Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.601" offset="16321808">That's the support and assistance of the probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.772" offset="16334451">Finally, with respect to Mr. Justice Black's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.869" offset="16346885">I think Mr. Justice Black that you will not find in the record, the original record any indication of a number of prior incidents of this boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.369" offset="16380844">The record only shows that he was a probationer of the juvenile court at the time that he was picked up here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4100.578" offset="16505710">We think that the sentencing question is a fairly straight forward application in respect in Patterson with one wrinkle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.894" offset="16546983">There is no doubt that when this boy's maximum sentence was determined subsequent to his original trial that a finding was made which was neither required nor in fact made at the original juvenile trial, which was that he was adjudicated a delinquent on the basis of an offense which would be first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.055" offset="16631620">That involves findings not made at the time of the trial, within the meaning of Speck, a new fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.964" offset="16659205">Under New Jersey law, evidence is admissible going to that fact, such as evidence of diminished capacity, in this case psychiatric evidence which was not put in by his counsel as it should not have been at the original trial since it didn't matter what degree of homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.960" offset="16727228">He was found guilty of as a juvenile prior to the new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.725" offset="16742275">Now, the only question therefore is whether or not Speck applies if the new finding of fact is required not by antecedent legislation, but by subsequent legislation which state law chooses to make retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.926" offset="16803088">As far as I can see that makes no difference whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.720" offset="16814268">It is the state of New Jersey which has chosen to said that a differentiation between two classes of people should be made, those who have been found guilty of first degree of homicide and those who have lesser degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.255" offset="16864423">The difference is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.720" offset="16870275">The difference in this case was the difference between six years in prison, this boy would have been released sever years ago, and a life sentence, that fact is a critical fact it was not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.914" offset="16914996">The state has put it in issue by the new legislation and we think that the petitioner had the right to hearing on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4245.946" offset="17087195">It's not like the defense of consent in a rape case which isn't consistent with alibi.</text>
