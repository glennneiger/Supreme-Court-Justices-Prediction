            <text syncTime="258.257" offset="1136410">The reason we contend the facts in this case are not in dispute is that pleading of the Court of Appeals even in its majority opinion as well as in the Seventh Circuit -- the dissent of Seventh Circuit and the opinion -- per curiam opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court clearly on agreement on the nature of the conduct here.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.769" offset="1214464">Of the 10 reviewing judges who had an opportunity to examine the record all 10 agreed on the conduct only two felt constrained by the constitutional prohibition as they read it to rule that Allen was unlawfully removed from his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.484" offset="1285308">Just briefly, the respondent threatened the life of the trial judge, ripped his attorney's file and arranged the court in such a way that the judge felt his removal was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.576" offset="1333687">I might add that there was a warning in all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.170" offset="1348002">Some of the commentators on this area have suggested that if this rule of exclusion is allowed that it be appropriately done in areas where there are warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.145" offset="1387917">The Court of Appeals in its majority opinion found adequate warning by the trial judge and I suggest there is more than one warning included in the administrators from the trial court for the respondent to remain silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.160" offset="1472031">Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe the trial took approximately two-and-a half days.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.476" offset="1489272">It was a jury trial; it was a simple case of an armed robbery of a tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.672" offset="1522082">Allen was identified by the bartender and in turn Allen identified the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.235" offset="1544338">The defense was insanity in -- the year-and-a-half before the defendant had been declared incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.228" offset="1576312">He had been restored and his defense from sanity was rejected by the trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.913" offset="1619048">We are here today because we feel, we have asked this Court to review because we do not believe that the constitution in the United States compels the result which the Seventh Circuit reluctantly I might add arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.621" offset="1673906">We feel that the right of confrontation through its birth in the common law, certainly and its adoption by the Sixth Amendment wasn't meant to broaden the exceptions that the common law recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.043" offset="1723538">And this Court in 1926 in Salinger versus United States specifically mentioned that while the common law was brought into the purview of the Sixth Amendment's right to confrontation it certainly wasn't meant to make the exceptions not included in that new amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.367" offset="1804831">This Court had in Diaz versus the United States in 1912 clearly addressed itself to the issue of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.737" offset="1850284">Now, in that case the murder case out of the Philippines tried on the Philippine Code, the court concluded that what they were reviewing was a substantial equivalent of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.401" offset="1909008">The court -- the issue in Diaz as presented or the claim made was that the Supreme Court -- in the Supreme Court here that he did not waive the right of confrontation but that he could not waive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.918" offset="1967000">This Court held that waiver was possible, was permissible and did obtain in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.989" offset="1995316">In that case, the defendant voluntarily left.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.075" offset="2011721">The Court sent a message to the presiding judge that he wouldn't return.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.620" offset="2033873">Significant, we feel in this case are two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.395" offset="2044949">One, the Davis case which the only direct American president other than the prior Illinois case in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.395" offset="2076923">On this point was mentioned in Davis favorably -- in Diaz favorably and what is significant is that Diaz they're residing Davis which was an involuntary removal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.698" offset="2158216">We feel that if waiver is recognized, certainly the waiver by an escapee from a courtroom that the unruly defendant is not be accorded treatment different in the escapee.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.199" offset="2220178">Diaz makes it clear that a defendant walks out or escapes, waives his right to be present as the trial can continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.014" offset="7451460">The respondent William Allen on August 12, 1956 at about 3 o'clock in the morning walked into a tavern, went to a corner of the bar where no one was around and when the bartender came over to ask him what he wanted to drink, the bartender saw a gun -- Allen said, “I want the money,” the bartender took the money and gave it to him and Allen left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.043" offset="7539545">A few hours later Allen was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.062" offset="7551666">He was searched, no gun, but approximately $200.00 was found in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.905" offset="7574967">The officer said, “Where did you get the money?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.274" offset="7584475">And Allen said, “Oh I robbed this bar this evening.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.017" offset="7599417">With that, he was taken to the police station and subsequently there was a line up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.296" offset="7620524">When Allen was walked in with several other suspects to be viewed by the owner of the bar and the bartender both of whom were in the bar when the robbery occurred before he could be identified, Allen said, “Hey, I recognize you, you look familiar, didn't I rob you this night?”</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Reed Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="3510.967" offset="14147271">Well, no, he was warned once about conducting his trial then that right was denied him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.233" offset="14172348">I believe he was just warned twice about his being removed and when he didn't pay attention he was then removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.268" offset="14188440">And I don't think those warnings were sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.628" offset="14221876">This is actually a case of first impression; this court has never really ruled on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.199" offset="14244133">The case as I cite -- the Hopt, case, the Shields to the Lewis case deal with examination of jurors or jury instruction outside the presence of the defendant and these cases rely on due process of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.811" offset="14310588">The Diaz case came out of the Philippines which although the Philippine Government Act had a similar provision as the right of confrontation which was supposedly based on the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.695" offset="14358131">Diaz expressly waived his right to be present during the trial.One of the reason it was because the trial took several months and they would recess for 30 or 60 days and he has lived way far from the court and it was inconvenient from the Bean (ph) court so we said, "We'll proceed without him, there's only one or two – it's just going to be heard," "my attorney will be there, he can handle it for me."</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.542" offset="14445589">I don't believe that would, what Mr. Justice Cardozo said in Schneider is applicable because that was a case involving whether a defendant had the right to go to a view of a scene with the jury under Massachusetts law that right did not exist although the right exists in most of the jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.184" offset="14528136">Mr. Justice Cardozo was in the violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because at this time the certain rights out of the Sixth Amendment first time have been said that and incorporated and applied to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.867" offset="14610892">The Sixth Amendment historically -- the right of confrontation, it's not clear where it came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.731" offset="14634297">Some people say that some commentators say it comes basically from the evils of the Star Chamber proceedings in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.770" offset="14662405">Others say it stems from the injustice which happened to Sir Walter Raleigh who was tried in 1603 for treason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.372" offset="14712874">This in effect was really an early political trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.964" offset="14727189">Queen Elizabeth had died and her successor, I believe was King Charles wasn't pleased with Rollie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.337" offset="14764701">Rollie had caused the death of the (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="3673.700" offset="14798137">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.437" offset="14809109">Just on the two main cases relied upon by the respondent writing in Schneider versus Massachusetts, Mr. Justice Cardozo stated Hopt v. Utah has been distinguished and limited and what was said in Hopt v. Utah under subject of the presence of the defendant was dictum and no more, we may say the same of Lewis versus the United States and if I might state the second on the state of the record Mr. Kelly who was counsel for the defendant below was appointed on October 14th the next proceedings were December 11 in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.282" offset="14936482">He was granted the right to be co-counsel in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.522" offset="14949439">It was only when he was disrupted during the voir dire that the judge asked that he let his counsel take over and that's when first right ensued, and leave the court with Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.974" offset="14987264">The Court of Appeal's decision can be sustained only by the most slavish reading of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.905" offset="15014954">I respectfully ask this Court to reverse.</text>
