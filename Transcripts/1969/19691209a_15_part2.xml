            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">I think, Mr. Baird you have one minute left and I take it you're reserving that for a rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.641" offset="153893">Mr. Wilmer, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="16.232" offset="168312">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.498" offset="181373">I think at the outset it might be appropriate and go serviceable to the Court, if we would first put in proper relationship, proper context the record in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.794" offset="246575">I would say at the outset that the position of the respondent is not one of an advocate either way so far as this question of finality is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.370" offset="296835">As we review our responsibility here to simply to bring to the Court the facts with respect to this question and then proceed on to as best we can explain the other proceedings in the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.182" offset="356080">I think the best way to put the record in proper relationship to the actual facts is perhaps to begin with the response which was filed by the committee in the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.707" offset="438209">Now, it is my understanding from reading rules of this Court that papers that are certified by the clerk of the lower court are part of the record and subject to being considered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.744" offset="502366">I say that for this reason that the appendix which is part of the petitioners filing with this Court excerpts from the committee's response to our Supreme Court, certain portions of that response, necessarily when this matter was brought to the attention of the committee, the full impact, the full exposure of this case in this Court, was not readily understood, and accordingly we did not enlarge upon the printed portions of the response of the Arizona committee on examinations to the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.396" offset="684910">The original, however, is in the record and I would like briefly to refer to that with the Court's permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.389" offset="720959">I say that for this reason that we have indicated our position as one of simply here are the facts we made us on the citing of the case now as any other time if in fact this Court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.171" offset="780100">The Court will recall that it has been brought to the Court's attention that the proceeding in the Arizona Supreme Court was initiated by a petition for an order to show cause, directed to the Committee on Examinations and Admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.605" offset="849795">And referring to the appendix before I move on, the prayer of that petition read as follows, the Arizona Supreme Court, “Wherefore your petitioners pray that this Court make another its order requiring the Committee on Examinations and Admissions of the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona be in appear before this Court of at to date at a time certain then an order to show cause, if any it may have, quite petitioner should not be forth with recommended for admission by the State to the State Bar or in the alternative show cause like petitioner's applications should not be processed by the committee without requiring the petitioner, any further answer -- of petitioner any further answer to the question 27 of applicant's questionnaire and affidavit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="241.357" offset="1068805">The Court would recall this is a question which asked, “Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party or any organizations which supports the overthrowing of the Government of the United States by force and violence?”</text>
            <text syncTime="255.678" offset="1126066">The opening portion on the memorandum which the committee filed with the Arizona Supreme Court reads as follows: “Applicant in a main treats the posture of our application to the committee as rejected by the committee, and from this false premise enlarges upon a proposed constitutional rights of the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.073" offset="1215613">Nothing could be chored from the true fact.”</text>

            <text syncTime="295.200" offset="1284159">Well, Your Honor, I must say it frankly, I didn't suppose it would be needed at the time when I read the appendix as certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.964" offset="1311222">In other words, we did not have a complete view of the flow of the case in this Court as to what or would not be material.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.974" offset="1343300">Because I read your rules and I assume I am correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.877" offset="1354898">Even though it is not printed in the appendix, nonetheless say for this part of the certified record, it may be referred to before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.014" offset="1387395">Of course if that is not true, I should not do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.754" offset="1878392">The Committee on Examinations and Admissions is a criterion hand made of the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.012" offset="1899395">We have no authority other than that which the Court gives us and I might say if it should become of consequence, the entire rules of the Arizona Supreme Court that are in volume I believe it is 17 of West Publishing Companies of Arizona revised statues.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.467" offset="1961253">They govern, they limit, they set to the extent of our authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.588" offset="1977762">We have no inherent authority or any kind, the rights other than oath givens by the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.448" offset="2005138">Therefore, when the Court says to us, ask these questions and they're set out verbatim and this is one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.497" offset="2049337">Get the answers from them and then you proceed to certify to this Court your opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.366" offset="2068877">We have no choice as far as we're concerned, we are stymied.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.881" offset="2082879">We cannot reject it much more as we could if we want to be arbitrary, perhaps we should.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.420" offset="2101060">I don't know but the facts are that in less and until that question is answered or someone tells us that we most do something else that case with that matter we'll say it as it is.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="509.347" offset="2140766">In other origin, is it fair to say that in practical effect as far as her position is concern, you're continuing to sit down on the hypothetical premises that no litigation had been brought here will be the equivalent if you're saying, “Well you're required to answer this question, since you won't cooperate with the committee, we won't admit you in to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.948" offset="2231150">Is that accurate?</text>

            <text syncTime="535.912" offset="2247032">The committee has no authority one way or the other to admit or reject anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.673" offset="2266049">We merely make a recommendation to the Arizona Supreme Court does the admission, does the rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.441" offset="2285171">I would say this if it may please the Court that Justice Harlan by interaction between the rule and the committee's action for practical purposes, I would conceive that Mrs. Baird is for the moment at least effectively stymied.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.695" offset="2350164">Now, whether she should bring a mandamus and in that faction call upon the Arizona Supreme Court to make an effective ruling that is not automated within our providence.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.746" offset="2394363">I would simply say that as are the moment at least, the Arizona Supreme Court has been told by the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.972" offset="2419231">We haven't made our decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.971" offset="2427277">We are unable to make a decision and therefore we submit the matters as it is and the Court simply said, “Well we deny the petition, you should complete due process in this petition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="593.482" offset="2477328">Now, whether that amounts to finality or not within the rule of this Court, I don't know, I express the opinion as to it, I simply bring it to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.276" offset="2512436">I might say though for the purpose of my next statement to the Court that this letter of April 24, 1968 which antedated the beginning of this proceeding to Mr. Allen as chief counsel for the petitioner, I believe has some of validity and some value in determining what in effect, what in fact I should say is the actual position of the committee in the court below and the committee here.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.025" offset="2639496">This letter said, I also believe, that Mrs. Baird should realize that even though she answered the question, “Did she had at one time been communist or had had otherwise been associated with the organizations not regarded as friendly to the United States Government?”</text>
            <text syncTime="649.658" offset="2701981">This would not necessarily cause us to reject her application.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.159" offset="2720057">We would undoubtly want to ask you some questions as to her present beliefs and as to the other matters which would bear upon the effect of such membership would have are their qualification to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.921" offset="2775019">The committee is aware that under presence of Supreme Court decisions, mere membership in an organization is not sufficient necessarily to disqualify rank and positions of responsibility and this would be the added through the committee in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.542" offset="2837504">Now, I say that for this position for this reason if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.166" offset="2868015">We have had here what I would term some rather fancy steps down the sidelines, so to speak, of what words mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.919" offset="2919006">I believe that as we proceed, we'll find the committee made it an unequivocally and plainly apparent to Mrs. Baird.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.187" offset="2952129">We were not concern with what her beliefs were such.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.164" offset="2968012">We are not concerned with looking inside her heart to see what she believe or didn't believe in.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.219" offset="2984208">We were concerned with finding out did she have the qualification which should make her a lawyer, which would justify us in certifying to the Arizona Supreme Court that in fact she would be a lawyer that the Court would be proud of having admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.493" offset="3053380">Now, a fair reading, I believe if it please the Court of the committee's a letter to Mr. Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.780" offset="3106461">The Committee's response to the Arizona Supreme Court have our response here indicates simply one thing whether we use the word "belief" or whether we use the word "view"1 or whatever word we use.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.491" offset="3169364">We are concerned with one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.473" offset="3181275">I heard yesterday the questioned ask if Mr. Baird would prefer the question he presented here whether the record he's made in the court below or here.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.255" offset="3220355">And I believe he said here.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.558" offset="3229654">I have to confess surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.331" offset="3240730">I wrote them both and I really didn't think I was saying anything different one time than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.389" offset="3260897">I thought we were saying to the court below and the thought we're saying to this Court that if Mrs. Baird believes in the sense that she would actively advocate and assist and advance the overthrow of the Government of the United States and the States of Arizona by force and violence, we want no pardon nor will we recommend her for admission to our Arizona Supreme Court unless and until we are told to do so by some higher authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.589" offset="4929703">I find it difficult, if it please the Court, to believe that the notion of a bomb dropped at the appropriate time in 17 different places in the United States and then attempt to take over the Government is a political matter and that is what I read into the notion of overthrowing this Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.015" offset="5023431">1I do not read into the notion of assassination of public officials, members of the Congress or other persons which in positions of authority for the bad purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.079" offset="5095737">Some years back, unfortunately we had I suppose what was then considered a form of the administration of justice in the western states and unfortunately in other places commonly known as necktie parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.747" offset="5154356">But all of these are true that when that unfortunate individual was strung up who is suspected of having been a rapist, suspected of having been a murderer or whatever capital thief, whatever you want to term it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.225" offset="5208273">I suspect that you might turn not the administration of justice but I don't believe that you would term that the administration of justice in the sense that we are speaking of the administration of justice today and by like talking, I do not believe that the notion of violence, a violent overthrow the Government of this country for the very purpose of destroying it as a political belief, if so on smarter than I will have to convince the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.947" offset="5967182">In Arizona and Massachusetts and Florida and Washington, they have what is called dog race and in that particular activity which is per mutual betting situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.853" offset="6022771">Dogs that have never run are what are called schooled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.571" offset="6037608">In other words they are run through the race as if it was a race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.859" offset="6062791">There time is recorded, the whole thing is recorded just like any race track in which way with desire to know about any dog or horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.438" offset="6097168">And based on that when they do start running they are (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.839" offset="6122768">Well, now the reason that is you has a track record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.428" offset="6133112">You have something to go over and those that have been on the track and have run have already established themselves and I say therefore that when someone comes who has not have a track record as to we have no background, then rightfully a different rule should apply than from a lawyer who has been admitted to practice which established his reputation or his ability relative to practice, who has in all things carry himself such at the bar may property criticized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.029" offset="6255470">And then therefore, I say that when we say that a lawyer who has been admitted to practice who is a practicing lawyer should be permitted to take the Fifth Amendment, I would readily distinguish that from the applicant who is a raw product, if I may use that, that expression, whose qualifications, whose future, whose ability is unknown that then we must judge and therefore we are entitled to ask many questions, we probably should not and could not answer at admitted lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.401" offset="6384933">I would just say and closely if it please the Court that there are some very sound reasons for the formality of this affidavit and the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.029" offset="6435506">I realized it is perhaps since burdens at some of the outset but without attempting if it please the Court to appear critical of our law schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.179" offset="6476048">I think one of the biggest problems that is met by the bar today and by the administrative committee is a complete default in many of the law schools of any attempt to teach ethics at all, of any attempt to teach professional responsibility and it is only when we bring these young people up short against an application which indicates, this is a mighty important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.870" offset="6578866">This is a type of practice that is very, very important that all these things declared before you may practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.293" offset="6608541">We think that tends to bring to their mind and perhaps the consciousness of the importance of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.020" offset="6635499">I might just say it in one more other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.896" offset="6646993">Seven or eight years ago, Ohio Supreme Court at the committees request, adopted a rule that says you can't be admitted to practice until you pass the examination of professional ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.578" offset="6689729">You can't be admitted until you have passed that examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.416" offset="6709060">I will say this that we no longer have applicant who spell Canons of Ethics, C-A-N-N-O-N-S then I can spell up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.372" offset="6744900">We do not catch anyone on the basis of that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.912" offset="6759006">We teach them how the lawyers, if it please the Court, that this is an important profession and that ethics is probably the most important part of it and therefore this type of an application, we feel, is highly important as bringing ho1me to the extent we can to the applicant, this is a mighty important thing you're going into.</text>
