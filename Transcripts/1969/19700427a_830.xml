            <text syncTime="68.475" offset="377292">This kernel matter is before the Court on write of certiorari to the Court of appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.269" offset="408430">Constitutional questions presented are whether petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel where he met his lawyer on the hallway on the way to the courtroom for trial on serious criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.134" offset="467884">It also involves the constitutional question of whether a warrantless search of an automobile in which the petitioner was a passenger which was made while he was in custody in a police station after the car had been moved from the scene of arrest to the police station and where there have been two previous searches of the same automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.032" offset="555551">It also involves the question of harmless error in connection with the admission into evidence of dumdum bullets which were illegally seized and then used to trial to connect petitioner with weapons that were found in the warrantless search of the car and also used to describe the severity of impact that could be made by such bullets two petitioner judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.615" offset="657847">The statement of -- the case in our brief is extensive. I'll try to summarize it more briefly for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.438" offset="689089">It opens with the statement within the first week of September 1963, petitioner and three co-defendants were tried on fourth criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.564" offset="733602">I find now since the time of preparation in my brief and I've advised my opponent Ms. Los that the record of this trial has become available to me and that trial did not involve four criminal charges but rather two.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.071" offset="799640">It appears that the indictment that was presented to the court and jury in that case involved solely the alleged robbery of the service station on May 28, 1963, and for reasons it will become apparent this is very important to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.642" offset="857945">I'd like to offer this to the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.334" offset="876753">At the trial in early September 1963, petitioner was represented by a member of the Legal Aid Society of Pittsburgh.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.073" offset="5819643">It states it quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.438" offset="5829151">In my remaining time I'd like to point out to the Court that our argument in connection with the rule of the Third Circuit as adopted in this case is erroneous that for the reason that I -- we do not believe that you must show specific prejudice in order to warrant reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.897" offset="5910967">We point to the case as this Court has considered in connection with recidivist proceedings in connection with the pretrial procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.323" offset="5948688">But in any event if you assume the validity of the rule adopted by the Third Circuit in this case which shifts the burden to the prosecuting authorities to show that there was not any prejudice from the lay appointment of counsel that this rule doesn't fall to the teachings of this Court as indicated in the case of Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.917" offset="6059029">Because in Chapman, this Court said that before you can declare a constitutional error to be harmless the Court must expressly believe that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and this rule as adopted by the Third Circuit talks in terms of overcoming this prima facie case of the ineffectiveness of counsel solely by adequate affirmative proof and we submit that adequate affirmative proof in this case is not the same thing as proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.440" offset="6181177">As in this case, we have nothing but the trial record before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.157" offset="6196015">And all that trial record discloses is what was done or what may have been counsel may have been able to do within the confines of the record as stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.304" offset="6240632">There is nothing here to indicate what could have been done and was not done, what counsel may have to consider and yet did not take any action upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.662" offset="6285981">We've pointed out in our brief that there are instances where even if you assume the validity of the rule and ignore the dictates of Chapman, that there is specific prejudice indicated, indicated by the failure of counsel for example to forcefully argue for severance of the indictments of the two counts in connection with the two separate robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.780" offset="6390471">There is no common scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.760" offset="6442402">In this case, the Third Circuit went beyond the rule of the Fourth Circuit and inquired into the adequacy of counsel solely by reference to the record of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.084" offset="6499662">Nothing was done here to develop what counsel could have done through his own testimony, this case unlike any other case that we could find counsel did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.975" offset="6543235">Counsel was not called to testify either in the state habeas corpus hearings or in the habeas corpus hearings in the federal district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.247" offset="6660368">There is no explanation for the failure of the counsel for example to file the pretrial motions as indicated by the record, this thing should be determined and can only be done so by following the dictates of Townsend against Sain and having a preliminary hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.389" offset="6992959">And said that you can nevertheless validate a warrantless search where the search was substantially contemporaneous and there was a reasonable nexus between the offense and the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.687" offset="7982164">The Commonwealth the Pennsylvania would readily agree that certainly no man should be asked to stand trial on serious criminal charges or in any charges unless he has had adequate opportunity to discuss his case with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.699" offset="8030124">But certainly counsel shouldn't be forced to represent the man with only a few moments notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.490" offset="8053321">This we feel destroys any semblance of the attorney-client relationship, because not only does it land itself to the fact that the attorney might not be adequately prepared but also he may likely in conation to act as an advocate on behalf of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.077" offset="8123643">Fortunately, that did not happen to Frank Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.129" offset="8135868">As the record shows, we know that he was visited during the five-month period that he was lodged in a county jail by an investigator from the Legal Aid Society that the investigator did prepare report that was reduced into writing and was placed in a file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.373" offset="8204831">But the file was subsequently turned over to Mr. Tamburo who was to represent Chambers on the day of trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.210" offset="8272227">Unfortunately, what happened to state habeas corpus hearing was the counsel for the petitioner then withdrew the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.523" offset="8313501">Consequently, the matter was never before the court, the Commonwealth was not required to go forward with its burden of proof or to present Mr. Tamburo or to offer, in fact any files or records from the Legal Aid Society.</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.272" offset="8612446">Yes, that is our point Your Honor, we are saying that they with -- if there is anything lacking in the record, then it is likely by virtue of counsel for the petitioner at the time withdrawing the allegation and consequently the Commonwealth then stopped its line of questioning with the petitioner on this lines and did not present any affirmative evidence to share the petitioner had had an opportunity to discuss this case with Mr. Tamburo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.453" offset="8721220">In any event, I think we can tell from the record that Mr. Tamburo was very much aware of the facts of the mistrial that it occurred three weeks prior and was certainly very much aware of the evidence that have been admitted at the previous trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.513" offset="8789452">Chambers now shows that the near fact that he didn't get to consult with Mr. Tamburo for longer period of time warrants a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2217.768" offset="8974399">Now, this is -- generally, this is the Pennsylvania rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.743" offset="8986311">In other words, the prisoner -- the petitioner would have to show that the appointment was made in bad faith as being merely perfunctory prior to trial or that he was actually prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.150" offset="9043989">This is the decision, I believe, that the Attorney General of New York seeks to bring before you in the amicus brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.908" offset="9071052">This position while we are certainly happy to have the work by the Attorney General of New York goes beyond the position that we are taken because we feel that as far as the facts of the apparent -- this criminal law in Allegheny County is concerned that the facts especially in this case might warrant the presumption that the Third Circuit has given in cases of belated appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.596" offset="9173765">For one thing, there is certainly a great hesitancy among the judiciary to judge defense counsel's work especially, if the judge has himself appointed defense counsel to represent an instant defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.673" offset="9242102">And again, there is a hesitancy on the part of the defense counsel to say that he actually was ineffective or was inadequately prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.179" offset="9280136">Of course, where he has not asked for a continuance of the case based upon these facts, it would be I think, more embarrassing for him to admit that he was inadequately prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.868" offset="9318797">And third, of course the prisoner lacking any legal knowledge would not be in a position to judge his attorney's competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.024" offset="9351502">Now the problem is aggravated in Allegheny County in Pittsburgh because there, unless the case is a murder case or involves an extensive string of armed robberies, counsel is appointed ahead of time, it is the public defender's office who is appointed and an investigator does a preparatory work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.504" offset="9433422">But unfortunately, the prisoner does not have an opportunity to speak with his counsel sometimes even just prior to going into the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.863" offset="9470830">Usually counsel, defense counsel will visit the prisoner in the bullpen which is located below the courtrooms on the morning of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.568" offset="9505625">But unfortunately, in most situations, I must admit the counsel does not have an opportunity to speak with his client until just moments before the trial begins.</text>
