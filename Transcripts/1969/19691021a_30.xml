            <text syncTime="12.143" offset="151907">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.641" offset="161938">This case arising from Greene County, Alabama is on appeal from a three-judge court for the Northern District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.879" offset="198928">Like the Turner case heard at the close of yesterday's session concerning Georgia's jury selection law, the issue posed is that of the constitutional validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of Alabama statute which vest successive discretion in jury officials in that state in the selection of jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.181" offset="292133">Our submission is that the use of statutes such as these in those states like Alabama which have a demonstrated history of discrimination against black people in the jury selection process is the major cause of the continuing phenomenon of racial exclusion of blacks from the opportunity for jury service in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.921" offset="399026">That's a phenomenon which is all too common place as this Court's experience in jury discrimination cases for the past 90 years attests.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="82.622" offset="433821">Supposing you didn't have this history of discrimination, would you still say the statute is unconstitutional?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="88.906" offset="459003">If you didn't have that history of discrimination, I would say that the statute is susceptible of abuse and therefore, if a different kind of demonstrated injury were made to appear that the Court would have to hold the statute unconstitutional.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="106.167" offset="528071">I'm going to sharpen the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.926" offset="535071">Supposing there was no evidence that it was affirmatively demonstrated that there had been no discrimination other to say about the statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="116.069" offset="567672">I would say that the statute is vague, lacking in standards, susceptible of abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.871" offset="594840">I would say that the Court would knock the issue of whether the statute was constitutional would not be present because there would be no history of the application of the vague standards to a situation in which one could demonstrate that constitutional rights had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.076" offset="679685">That's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.087" offset="683760">Every single -- all of the vagueness cases in this Court, the free expression area and the criminal area are cases in which some litigant came to the Court and said that the cause of these vague standards which give excessive discretion to officials, my constitutional rights are being violated and until a case of that kind reaches this Court, and it reaches this Court in this case and in Georgia and it has not as for example in Wisconsin or Maine, the kinds of questions that we were discussing yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.813" offset="838614">The Court obviously has no occasion to declare the unconstitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.096" offset="859721">But that has been the consistent pattern of litigation and decision making in this Court.</text>

          <turn speaker="norman_c_amaker" startTime="201.781" stopTime="294.613">
            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="201.781" offset="910503">Only in a very narrow sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.379" offset="916877">If what you're talking about is the matter in which the jury officials have used their discretion, which is what this --which is what the issue here is concerned with, then you're talking about -- then that's a different question from the way the District Court addressed the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.945" offset="995140">They simply said that if we issue an injunction, which tells these jury officials that they are no longer to discriminate that that's sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.216" offset="1036204">What I say is that does not deal with the problem of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.560" offset="1049579">That does not deal with the capability for discrimination that the statute invites, and therefore the only way that you can deal with that is to deal with the source of the problem which is the statutory standards itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.850" offset="1098794">That's exactly what this Court did in some of the cases that we cited in our brief involving discrimination against blacks in voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.363" offset="1128782">That's what this Court has done in all the vagueness cases that have come before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.795" offset="1146546">This is by now no novel doctrine in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.755" offset="1166399">You know in challenging this case, therefore Alabama's jury selection statute, I stressed of the outset of firm belief that this longstanding problem of racial discrimination in jury selection will not be solved, unless the Court respond to this challenge by voiding to provisions of the statute involved here and requiring the use of fairly administered objective standards for determining what person shall be listed on the roles of perspective juries on the State.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="294.613" offset="1281860">What would be your suggestion Mr. Amaker as to objective standards?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="300.406" offset="1304952">The kind -- one suggestion, I think it's exemplary only are kinds that the Congress enacted in dealing with the same problem in the context of the federal jury selection system.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.298" offset="1364616">After the key man system had been exposed as an apparatus whereby discrimination was being practiced against groups and the groups involved avail of principally Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.073" offset="1415711">In the federal system, Congress responded to that challenge by enacting the jury selection in Service Act of 1968.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="336.767" offset="1450402">Am I right that Congress was asked to enact those same standards for selection of state jurors?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_c_amaker" startTime="345.373" stopTime="392.805">
            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="345.373" offset="1484884">It -- well, let me show up in that they -- the proposed, there were two Bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.561" offset="1517589">They were both part of the 1966 Civil Rights package.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.271" offset="1532426">Now the Bill with respect to federal jury selection was taken out and enacted last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.980" offset="1559280">The Bill that was proposed in 1966 passed the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.131" offset="1579865">Now, they were in that -- there was in that Bill, Sections 203 (a) and (b) which together gave to the District Courts the judgment of whether they could require objective criteria in the state jury selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.767" offset="1662412">So it is pretty clear that the response --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="398.975" offset="1699297">What I mean, one that where the related selection of jurors in the State?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="403.249" offset="1716328">So far as I know Mr. Justice Brennan, it did not state what they should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.439" offset="1733151">The Federal Act stated the very simple ones of age, residency, absence of a felony conviction and the ability, the simple ability to read and write the English language as determined again objectively, not subjectively as determined by a person's ability to fill out a juror qualification form.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.394" offset="1820923">Now, that is the system that is in fact in operation throughout the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.513" offset="1841403">As I indicated in my reply brief in this case, District Courts throughout the country who have been faced with suits of the kind that this is an affirmative action seeking injunctive relief have directed or suggested to state officials that they ought to take a look at what the Congress did with respect to that federal statute, as a means of remedying the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.651" offset="1953938">That means to me is that it is pretty clear that 90 years of litigation and the repeated admonition to jury officials that they must reform their system really hasn't worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.871" offset="2014856">And the only kind of reform that is an essential step is to deal with the source of the problem which is the discretion vesting statutes like the one involved in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="491.168" offset="2068041">But do your really think that's the source of the problem, or do you think the source of the problem is simply an unreconstructed intention required to discriminate on the basis of those who were the job of picking juries?</text>

            <text syncTime="509.513" offset="2141393">Well, it's pretty clear Mr. Justice Stewart that that's true, but if the question that you have to ask is what can you deal with, what can a court deal with?</text>
            <text syncTime="518.674" offset="2178069">How do you remedy the problem?</text>

            <text syncTime="522.049" offset="2191548">I don't think that it's possible for this or any other court to remedy that problem by an injunction which says, administer the statute fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.724" offset="2234284">The Court has done that consistently for 90 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.784" offset="2246510">What it can do consistent with the decisions in this Court under the vagueness doctrine is to deal with the State enactment which permits those unreconstructed attitudes to be effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.799" offset="2302516">But on this case, and I'm just looking at a paragraph in your own brief on page 10 in which you summarized the injunction that was granted, it was against systematic and exclusion of Negroes from the jury roll of Greene County, and also an order requiring at a new jury roll showing the race and if available the age of each juror be filed with the court within 60 days, and a report showing the procedure used in compiling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.569" offset="2417664">Now, isn't that the way to get at this rather than to excise a couple of adjectives from the statute which --</text>

            <text syncTime="588.240" offset="2456325">If that were the way to get at it, Mr. Justice Stewart, you would not have the constant re-appearance of these jury discrimination cases in this Court and in courts throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.107" offset="2503764">And why I'm talking about the nation, I'm talking about the courts in that Southern Tier States where the problem has past persisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.224" offset="2532289">And just excising the language isn't effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.246" offset="2548381">What you have to do is to require that there be objective standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.727" offset="2854327">My own submission is that when you have language of this sort and you put that, you give the discretion to persons who are then reconstructed in their attitudes and who are all white in a community like Greene County which has a black majority that you get the kind of results that are shown on this record, and those results have been documented for several years.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.099" offset="3555767">Well, I start from the proposition that the District Court had a record of discriminatory action of a long period of time taken by jury officials all of whom were white.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.861" offset="3622849">I look at the statement in Louisiana v. United States which indicates that the District Court when dealing with this problem of racial discrimination has the duty to render a decree that will give effective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.734" offset="3698291">Now, it is true that as on our first submission, an essential first step is to get rid of a vague standards and to require objective criteria, but it is also pretty clear that there may well be a time lag between the time that that relief becomes effective and that in any event, it is a practical impossibility to excise all discretion from the administration of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.188" offset="3820126">On that basis then, it seems to me that in a community, the majority whose citizens -- the vast majority whose citizens are black, where you can demonstrate that white officials have consistently discriminated and there is no easier demonstration to make than on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.791" offset="3890552">That as an essential item of relief, the District Court in order to give the complete relief to which the parties here were entitled should have required the appointment of some black members to the jury commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.746" offset="4298376">And therefore, as a matter of relief, I see nothing wrong with the District Court stating that in order -- "Because of that of that, we are going to require you to, in this county at least, appoint commissioners in a different way."</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.600" offset="4357726">And that is, this Court has never indicated that under the supremacy clause, state laws and regulations once they were demonstrated to have play their part in the violation of the constitutional right could not be enjoined, or that the court could not as a court of equity, give the kind of relief to which the court deemed the parties were entitled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.245" offset="4520312">There is another point which I think I should address myself to that is the District Court's view in its opinion that it could not void the vague statutory standards because this Court had never held these criteria to be void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.212" offset="4624175">And it's cited for that proposition, Cassell versus Texas which is one of a group of five cases involving the Texas grand jury system from -- decided in this Court from 1940 to 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.796" offset="4682585">I cited also an old 1910 case called Franklin v. South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.657" offset="4702020">Now there is an argument addressed to both of these in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.038" offset="4727515">The submission is one that the Cassell case, in that case the issue was never raised on the court without inquiry indicated that the Texas statutory scheme was alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.023" offset="4779447">The Franklin case it seems to me is a case which has now really been eroded entirely by the later development of the vagueness doctrine in this Court has no continuing validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.122" offset="4831901">And neither of these cases, it seems to me, should be used to prevent the Court from granting the relief that we urge here.</text>
