            <text syncTime="42.660" offset="274056">This is case is a direct appeal from a decision of a three-judge court holding the Texas obscenity statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.680" offset="326092">The case arose in Dallas, Texas when the police officers under search warrants seized -- made seizures under a search warrant of a publication entitled “Dallas Notes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="73.298" offset="396518">It was a newspaper published every two weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="89.648" offset="461928">Subsequently, they went back again and made a seizure of the Dallas Notes and other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.432" offset="489096">I think we have about 3 --15, three-judge courts in Texas pending dealing with the obscenity statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.463" offset="557223">I would trade them for the facts of this case, but my purpose here is not either to condemn the Dallas police or to really defend their conduct because the order that’s appealed here is not a civil rights type of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.134" offset="631933">I mean a Title 42 situation where lawless conduct was alleged proved and found to be present.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.725" offset="898278">But again as I say, we have a situation here where the statute was bound to be unconstitutional and an injunction was issued which difficult actually in this case too.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.087" offset="955747">The problem with this case are twofold, I think in the area of the cases that are just been heard -- the three-judge court area their scope of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.598" offset="997752">Their permissible powers is one of the most complicated, even confusing areas of federal law and in this case we add to it the complexities of the obscenity law and we have a double doze, I think of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.758" offset="1066402">But in this case, the final judgment referred granted the injunctive relief and against the future enforcements of Section 1 and 2 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.027" offset="1139440">Now, I'm not sure whether to interpret that as enjoining future prosecutions or continued enforcement of the then pending prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.035" offset="1199522">If it's pending prosecutions, of course the anti-injunction statute may or not -- may not apply depending on how this Court rules and the cases that is just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.672" offset="1238079">I think if it does enjoin a pending prosecution the anti-injunction applies and it's my position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.363" offset="7996792">If I may say we do elude in our brief since it’s not of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.995" offset="8015391">We filed and presented and argued at some link the motion to suppress in the state court and one case in February of 1969 and its finding on October of 1969 that the state court did grant that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.433" offset="8081115">Some -- almost 10 months later, I think in the second pending criminal case are a motion to dismiss has been pending at least that long has never been acted upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.179" offset="8128136">Now, I would submit that during the period of gestation that we might will not -- the newspaper may will not have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.727" offset="8162304">Now, we have one more raid of this nature which typewriters and all the implements of the crime or seize might well have brought it to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.991" offset="8199293">We felt that it was the kind of circumstance that did require, did warrant injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.290" offset="8232521">Now, independent of the injunctive relief, we think that what we did in the relief we sought here was clearly on the contemplation of the declaratory judgment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.065" offset="8295633">In fact, that these legislative history of the statutes suggest that this is part of its purpose and that is to permit persons to go federal court to obtain declaratory judgment as to the unconstitutionality of a statute without risking future prosecution, without risking further harassment under a state statute which is on its face overbroad and unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.475" offset="8437321">Quoting from the Senate Report, “much of the hostility to the extensive use of the injunction powered by the federal courts will be obviated by enabling the courts to render declaratory judgments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.659" offset="8486013">And again, if I may say it was my thought initially that declaratory relief would've been ample relief for us but there was -- we had a three-judge court convened it was seemed a reasonable use of the time to reinstate a prayer for injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2374.766" offset="9602487">The -- we find ourselves then as we view the case that we have no 2283 problems, hence since we did not seek to enjoin the pending prosecutions and as I understand this Court's opinion in Dombrowski and Judge Haynesworth in Baines restraints upon on future prosecutions are beyond the reach of Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.405" offset="9713037">And that our case really falls within that narrow area of comity or abstention which this Court has spoken to in a number of opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.481" offset="9769253">I guess most recently it seemed in Zwickler versus Koota in which the Court said that the trial court in a case such as this had the duty to look to the necessity of declaratory relief independent of the determination as to injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.804" offset="9866637">And we think that in this instance, the declaratory relief was clearly proper under the governing decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.681" offset="9930062">We submit that this Court when it said that wherever the federal court said human rights under the federal constitutional are always a proper civic for adjudication but this would simply the kind of case we had -- the human rights we have where searches and seizures that were clearly reminiscent of Stanford versus Texas if anything they were worst and not one search but two searches, no indication by the Dallas police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.090" offset="10027760">They intended to abandon this course of conduct relying upon a Texas statute that on its face was overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.515" offset="10061406">And we would suggest that this case actually a sort of a proof of the pudding in the sense of a necessity of a principle akin to Dombrowski or akin to other decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.780" offset="10118457">That is facts that cry out for some relief, cry out for protection under the federal constitution and require the immediate attention and cannot be allowed to languish while state criminal prosecutions there's been no inhibition against the state from prosecuting Mr. Stein and we’re now almost two years from the filing of the original prosecution and they have it moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.251" offset="10236426">This and we think in keeping with my experience at least while I practice in Dallas there were off times long delays from between the filing of a prosecution and its all for a disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.141" offset="10295986">We caught ourselves when we had to find action and we think that lower court order is quite proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.340" offset="10332766">The Court's opinion addresses itself to obscenity not only on the ground that the statute punished mere possession but that it failed to contain the standard that was appeared expressly in Memoirs, again in Redrup, that is that the material be orderly without redeeming social value but Texas statute did not contain that narrowing deformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.862" offset="10442794">And hence, in our view permitted police officers such as in the instant case to use their own discretion, seize whatever they felt inclined to seize and hence the statute on this ground was overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.998" offset="10515414">In this connection, we do submit that none of the material seized at least it appears of record here -- the newspaper clearly was not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.720" offset="10554284">It was offensive, it may have been in bad taste, it may have some accorded ones views but it clearly was pure and simple speech of a highly political character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.201" offset="10596185">It's a dialogue, a rhetoric that it is new but it's at least it's political and it's the kind that's fairly protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.235" offset="10636309">Finally, in closing, we would say that the Texas statute although the lower court failed to pass upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.674" offset="10658043">There was entire alternative ground which the statute could've been stricken in our view and that is the statute's exemption wholly arbitrary exemption of daily and weekly newspapers by men who could not have the money to get himself out once a week, hence fell out of the statute because he published twice a month but yet the statute wrote a broad exemption for daily and weekly newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.022" offset="10747486">We think that in as much as we are in the area of what our essential fundamental rights of speech press that the standard by which this statute is to be just is not one of -- whether its arbitrary but rather whether this serves any compelling state interest that is the exemption as daily and weekly newspapers and we suggest that there is no compelling state interest to be served by that exemption and that provide an entirely alternative ground to affirm the court's action below without addressing itself to Mr. Zwiener’s request to write a final disposition on the question of obscenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.940" offset="10967124">I'd like to address myself just a minute to this exemption of newspapers as I said in the beginning whether the statute is constitutional or not the injunction was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.492" offset="11013308">But this exemption I think is perhaps unwarranted, unjustified but it was the best experience of the legislature at the time they passed this obscenity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.413" offset="11069001">Their experience was that newspapers do not publish pictures of nude women and so forth and they said well, we will exempt the newspapers both daily and weekly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.811" offset="11106617">I don't know that anybody thought of a newspaper published any other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.039" offset="11127515">As a matter of fact in the briefs below -- I brief the question fairly extensively and a newspaper was something that apparently is published either daily or weekly according to the common parlance but this I think was what the legislature knew of obscenity at the time this was a legislative judgment that in the newspapers matters obscene did not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.895" offset="11250918">The facts were discussed and I might expound on my just a moment on my thought that if these Dallas police officers did engage in lawless conduct, ignoring the statute or in ignoring proper constitution procedures you do not in my judgment have a three-judge court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.355" offset="11336808">You have a civil rights case which might be handled by one judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.863" offset="11354781">It would be not be a situation where you declare the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.262" offset="11384456">There are some questions in my mind whether an injunction could be issued in those cases but certainly the remedy would be as a civil rights complaint and I'm being harassed, tormented by the police officers who were deliberately setting out to suppress my civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.871" offset="11458853">We don't have this situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.469" offset="11485288">In conclusion, I again think that the facts of this case made in opinion for this Court on obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.341" offset="11520711">I think my preference would be if the court wrote Judge Harlan's view taken in Roth where he expressed the point of view that the state should be permitted to legislate in this area without regard to the national standard saying that one of the geniuses of the federal system as we have some 48 at that time little laboratories where this type of experimentation can go on and he sees nothing that will be detrimental to the contrary in permitting the state to experiment.</text>
