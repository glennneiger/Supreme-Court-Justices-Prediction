            <text syncTime="47.392" offset="292968">We have here before the Court today a problem, which this Court had occasion approximately two years ago to review the pass judgment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.665" offset="350020">We have in review here, the so-called Iron Curtain Statute for the State of New York known as the New York Surrogate's Procedure Act to formerly Section 269-a and now for the reason amendment of June of '68 known as Section 2218.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.051" offset="443538">Now, this statute in substance provides that an heir legatee or beneficiary of funds from the state or other source in New York who happens to reside in one of so-called Iron Curtain countries that the State of New York will protect this particular citizen national of that country by withholding the transmittal of his distributive share to funds that he is entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.529" offset="605497">If he would not have the benefit or use for control of the money or other property to him or if there are other special circumstances that make a desirable of such payment it should be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.720" offset="666206">Now, this law of New York is substantially identical to one of the three provisions of the Oregon statute, which this Court struck down as an impermissible interference with federal power over foreign affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.672" offset="750111">Is there any escheat provision in the New York law?</text>

            <text syncTime="165.682" offset="766098">Your Honor, the New York law is a custodial in nature that provides -- does not provide for escheat.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="172.536" stopTime="173.225">

            <text syncTime="173.225" offset="796296">Under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.550" offset="801520">The money is placed in all appellates, its placed in the deposit in one of the banks in New York until such time as the particular heir or beneficiary is representing and could come in and satisfy the court that he will have the use benefit or that circumstances of change and then the Court could reconsider the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.045" offset="895561">As a practical matter funds belonging to Romania nationals of been brought in excess of 25 years as the matter now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.988" offset="951359">There was one challenge to the statute by Romania heirs the Greenburg case, which we mentioned in our brief and in that case the heir sought to establish to the satisfaction onto a surrogate of New York county that they do have to use benefit and control in that circumstances are such in Romania that that to be permitted to have their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.655" offset="1049997">And, the surrogate there found that the evidence was in such an issue to convince him that they would have to use benefit in control or the circumstance of change.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.652" offset="1093987">Now, this matter was appealed to the Court of Appeals of New York and they denied leave to appeal allow the surrogate's decision and the Appellate Court which affirm and allow that decision to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.031" offset="1151457">Now, in our case, citizens who are entitled to have been or are entitled to funds which are bring withheld from them challenged the New York Statute by filing an action in the United States District Court for the southern district of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.093" offset="1243721">Challenged the constitutionality of that statute then sought to have its application enjoined and so far as the rights of Romania national are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.302" offset="1280606">At the same time, they asked for the convening of a three-judge court to hear the Congressional challenges to the New York Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.498" offset="1321357">The district judge initially denied the convening of a three-judge court on the ground that he thought the constitutional challenges were frivolous and appealed to the United States Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.363" offset="1372871">The Court right from the bench affirmed the district judge in holding that the constitutional challenge is not serious enough to convene a court in upon certiorari granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.573" offset="1425638">Now, this Court some merely reversed and remanded the case back to the United States Court of Appeals for further conservation in the light of Zschernig v. Miller which this Court had decided while the petition for certiorari was pending initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.939" offset="1483107">Now, at that stage, we had thought upon reading discerning decision that because of the swiping rational of the majority in the concurring opinion that -- and the New York statute being so similar to the Oregon's statute that, that question would put to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.263" offset="1560430">That similar statutes which such as New York were unconstitutional because they were enacted in such a fashion that they compel the courts to intrude into an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.494" offset="1605360">That is the exclusive domain of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.841" offset="1622706">Upon hearing by the three-judge court, -- the three-judge court found otherwise, the matter was heard in -- before the three-judge court in June of 25th, 1968 and sure that before that the New York Court of Appeals had occasion for the first time since Zschernig to review the New York law in the light of the Zschernig decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.916" offset="1723016">And that was the case which is mentioned in both brief the matter of liken, and in that case, New York Court of Appeals felt that under record of that case, there was no showing that the New York courts have engaged in any of the activities that were proscribe by Zschernig.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.784" offset="1806503">And, felt that the statute of New York is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.660" offset="1833984">Well, the same conclusion was reached by the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.607" offset="1853837">The three-judge court felt that upon the record before it that the -- there is no showing that the New York Courts have engaged in the activities proscribe by Zschernig.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.878" offset="1922905">Now, the matter of court -- the three-judge court in our case had the matter before on a motion for some re-judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.522" offset="1957491">The matter was filed before the decision of Zschernig and after the decision of this Court in Zschernig, the appellants filed a motion for some re-judgment on the strength of the conclusions that put to be drawn from a Zschernig.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.490" offset="2013288">And in support of that motion for some re-judgment, the appellants attached an affidavit and which there were set fort many cases and instances which appellant sought to establish that the New York courts in interpreting and in construing the New York statute were in the fact engaging in activities proscribed by Zschernig.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.372" offset="2124884">Now, in the case of the Romanian interest, Greenburg has established a precedent that as a result of that -- as a result of the finding in Greenburg that all other courts and followed Greenburg as holding that the mere fact that you are resident for City of Romani, thereby you were not entitled to have your money because of that decision of the policy of the state of New York in withholding these funds from these appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.434" offset="2273155">Now, it is interesting that in Greenburg, the three-judge court had determined that there was no showing that any courts had engaged in any proscribe of activities yet, the Greenburg decision which was before the court very clearly shows that the court engaged in such post crime activities in seeking to convince the court that money should be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.883" offset="2442951">The parties, the Romanian and plaintiffs in that case had summoned the chief for the counselors section of a domain in the legation at that time and to testify with reference to the inheritance laws of Romania and to the relevant laws would reference to the problem at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.264" offset="2524453">And, after establishing his expertise in the matter, and testifying that there are no restrictions, the court refused to give any credence to the testimony of this expert who according to my understand ever who was not impeached in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.016" offset="2599476">And, moreover, the Court in reaching his conclusion had to consider the foreign exchange control of the laws of Romania and, in doing so, the court found that he did not like the rate of exchange that these citizens of Romania were receiving and therefore held that in effective of confiscatory and by reason of that, that they would not have to use benefit in control of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.092" offset="2747747">This same position on the foreign exchange allows was also taken by the Appellate Court which affirmed to decision of the surrogate and the surrogate somehow and I'm not familiar where the surrogate came to the conclusion that Romanian lei which is the Romanian currency could be purchased here in the United States and New York had a very high rate of exchange certainly much higher than the official exchange and use that as a basis to conclude that the -- since the exchange are such of discrepancy and what you can buy currency in New York and what official exchanges that therefore these people were not getting all they what they are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.960" offset="2955264">Now, I don't know where that Greenburg Court had got in the exchange of 31 and ¾ of my understanding Romanian law does not permit any of their currency to come in from abroad or, they do not sell it as far as I could ascertain official anywhere in the world that 31 and ¾ allay to a dollar presumably there is a black market in that exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.740" offset="3066337">But I don't see how a black market rate of exchange could furnish the basis of illegal decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.632" offset="3089951">But, in any event, we have other showings in the affidavit that support of the motion for some re-judgment showing that the various attitudes of the state controller who has some of these funds under his custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.724" offset="3162258">And, the courts that they have engaged in attitude that certainly clearly proscribe by a Zschernig.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.705" offset="3206144">Now, interestingly enough, the only authority is in the United States that I have knowledge of a do not or still at here to this iron curtain statute in type of law is the state in New York and the Attorney General of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.384" offset="3272913">But, in my experience, in the last 10 years in many of other jurisdictions of Florida and Maryland and Connecticut and New Jersey and Ohio and Michigan all have statutes which I think were copied from the New York statute which are substantially identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.717" offset="3342190">And, these are -- all of these of jurisdictions and the courts in these jurisdictions have not applied their iron curtain statute to the rights of the Romanian interest once they were aware and were pointed with the financial agreement of 1960 between Arab country and Romania whereby our country had released all blocking controls and restriction regarding the transmittal of public funds to Romanian.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.535" offset="3457546">And, ever since then, they have been sending such things as social security benefits and various pensions and other public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.507" offset="3493386">And, more interesting since Zschernig, the State of Oregon has held its statute to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.159" offset="3532048">California is -- and the reason appellate decision on October 9th of this year in California State of Kramer also follows there and he held that by reason of the holding in Zschernig that their statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.799" offset="3590562">And, in Montana, we have the situation in ad valorem case, there was up before this Court and decided in January of this year were the appropriate court found that in view of Zschernig and the concurring opinion of the court in Vorem versus Fall that there is no question that the statute cannot be applied constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.207" offset="3676244">And, therefore, did not follow it however, the Attorney General disagreed and he presently have filed an appeal to the probate court's decision appeal to the Supreme Court of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.362" offset="3736848">Now, we have a recent decision from three-judge court for the northern district of Ohio, eastern division which to my knowledge is not reported where an identical action was filed challenging the iron curtain statute of Ohio by a certain Czechoslovakian heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.021" offset="3843427">And, the statute in Ohio is substantially identical as the New York statute, it's a custodial statute and it provides that the heir has the burden to prove that he has the use for control of -- would have the use and control of the funds or that special circumstances in the country of his residence would not prevent him from using and enjoying his property without confiscation or hold or impart.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.196" offset="4000162">And, I think that my position would reference to the New York statute is very well said out by the three-judge district court in this Ohio case of Maro versus Batten.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.654" offset="4062020">They may are all --</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.910" offset="4199006">And, in that -- they have the same problem, the same action challenging the constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.542" offset="4217501">I'm asking for convening of the three-judge court and that court in striking down and following Zschernig states that it follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.664" offset="4262013">The so-called iron curtain statute such 211381 and that is the Ohio statute were recently considered by the United Stated Supreme Court in Zschernig versus Miller and then it goes on to elaborate on the type of statue of Oregon have the three provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.210" offset="4328260">And then in its appeal in the court when I to say further “in passing upon the validity of the statute,” the Supreme Court consider the whole area of reciprocal inheritance statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.924" offset="4375071">The Court drew a distinction between reciprocal inheritance statutes which permits the state court only to re-construe on the apply laws of foreign nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.604" offset="4413837">And, those which permit the court -- state court to launch enquiries and to the type of governments that obtain in a particular foreign nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.413" offset="4449050">Citing its earlier decision in Clark versus Allen, the Court noted that state courts are not precluded from really construing and applying laws of a foreign nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.273" offset="4488443">The court held however that where statute permits inquiry and to the type of government existing in a foreign nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.595" offset="4513729">Or into the operation of that government or into the question of whether the legal rights guaranteed by the nation or rights in fact or into the question of whether statements by the representatives of foreign nations are credible or made in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.601" offset="4565765">Or into the likelihood that the legatees will actually receive the property left to them such statutes so applied intrudes into the exclusive right of Congress to regulate foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.863" offset="4610800">Section 211381, Ohio revised code which is a statute that issue in the present case is someone different from the Oregon statute involved in Zschernig.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.213" offset="4648208">In Ohio, the statute requires the probate court to determine whether or not the foreign legatee will have to been further use or control of the money left him because of circumstances prevailing at that the place of residence of such legatee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.513" offset="4721455">The Ohio statute does appear to be directed had an inquiry into the operation of the foreign government and into the political economic and social conditions prevailing in the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.074" offset="4767640">This type of inquiry is specifically prohibited by the doctrine of Zschernig versus Miller and we say that that exact language had exact argument as applicable to the New York statute here under review because this statute also provides that if there is a special circumstance -- special circumstances that the points of residence which would make it appear that the party would have not have the money then the court could withhold the funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.402" offset="5049031">Now, in so far as this statute is concerned, I think this Court in the majority and Mr. Justice Stewart's concurring opinion made it clear that the fatality of the infection that's involved is that the statute is freeing in such a manner that they compels the Court to go into internal matters, to go into the nature of the government, the policy of the government, the laws of the government and the laws of the government were relations to their citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.741" offset="5170343">And because these statutes are framed in such a way, the conclusion is inescapable that these courts are intruding into an area that's the exclusive domain or the federal government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.047" offset="6235512">But, I think that the reading of Zschernig, I think that the reasonable conclusion be drawn from that that New York connected to such statute because it dislikes the particular governmental systems and the policies of these countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.782" offset="6330493">And that was the New York's way of reacting in a hostile fashion saying, where do you -- you appropriate properties of our nationals and you have a system where you deny your citizens the right to private property and because of that, they have enacted the statute to react to say, well, if you do all those things, we're going to withhold funds belonging to your citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.216" offset="6436237">And this type of conduct is the one that causes the statute to invalid because this is not a function of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.752" offset="6618363">I think that in our situation here with this financial agreement I think as Mr. Justice Douglas said in the Gorum case and which was joined by Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice Fortas he said that federal policy permits the free flow of funds to Romania which is true and that no state judge, they make or apply rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.770" offset="6714493">That is contrary to that policy which is true, I think -- I don't think the problem is a difficult to see and our estimation of it perhaps we're so obsessed and studies for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.591" offset="6753782">But, if your federal government does one thing and the state comes and says, well because the federal government for awhile was permitting funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.324" offset="6788681">And there are still countries where he did step in an action this area but when he steps in the area made a determination that these people will have the use of benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.871" offset="6838836">There is a reasonable insurance conditions are such for a state to come in and make a contrary determination to that made by the federal government which is entrusted with these matters which is in a better position to make such a determination and New York has said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.329" offset="6904665">And interestingly enough in the area where they refuse to transmit money, they were allowed federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.974" offset="6939251">They have said in the leading case prior case that the federal government in the better position to know what the situation is in Romania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.298" offset="6968613">And therefore since the federal government does not permit the sending of fund, we can rely and follow that policy and withhold the transcript of fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.993" offset="7003303">Yet, when the federal government has taken the position of free flow, the New York is still maintain the other position and that is the followed federal policy that would satisfy them and when they like federal policy, when they didn't like federal policy they refuse to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.618" offset="7057847">And I think that is the problem here, there's no question about it and the states who seen it except New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.738" offset="7078327">All of the authorities have seen it and there are many states which would not in that such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.917" offset="7095045">Illinois refused Governor Kerner refused to approve such a law difficult all because he says “We're getting in to an area that will exceed the constitutional authority of the state and we should enact in such an area and let the federal government act in such an area.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.060" offset="7151574">And therefore, I say, that the decision below is clearly contrary to the constitutional conclusion of this Court in Zschernig and should be reversed and these people are dire need of their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.462" offset="7201207">Many of them have passed away and many amounts are very modest should have their money at the earliest possible moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.071" offset="7467656">This appeal is before the Court after the denial of the motion for summary judgment by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.153" offset="7523976">Matter is before the three-judge court solely upon the basis of affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.959" offset="7559189">The Attorney General was prepared in connection with this case to go ahead with a trial of issue that have been presented by the pleadings here in order to have determine the issue which is presented by these plaintiffs of whether the New York statute which has under prior decisions been held to be valid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.241" offset="7724387">Determine have a three-judge court determine whether the statute was being applied in an unconstitutional manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.086" offset="7775692">Now, this Court had before a similar appeal from the denial of motion for summary judgment in Gloren against Follo, and the Court as I see it pretty much unanimously decided in that case that the summary judgment motion on appeal from the Montana District Court have been properly denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.597" offset="7917798">There was a dissent in Gloren which was predicated upon the fact that in Gloren, the District Court had completely dismissed the complaint which have been filed in that case in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.268" offset="8004420">And the dissent was based upon the theory that this Court whatever its prior decisions for the relation to abstention should have directed the Montana District Court to retain jurisdiction of the case to see what the state court would do where a relation to the decisions of this Court in the Zschernig case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.910" offset="8123016">Now, in the instant case the Attorney General has never moot to dismiss the complaint in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.260" offset="8168364">Despite the provisions of Section 2283, despite the fact that there are proceedings pending that were referred to in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.635" offset="8209951">Before the surrogate's court, before the various surrogates that are named as defendants in this case, despite that there are actual pending state court proceedings which the complaint seeks to enjoin and despite the fact that as I pointed out to this Court in the IANU case which was before this Court several years ago that the doors of the surrogate's court are constantly open to the making of any application to withdraw these funds so that instead of coming into the federal courts through the District Court through the three-judge court not to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.867" offset="8426872">These Romanian heirs are still in the position where they can go to the surrogate's court in New York and to apply from the withdrawal of the funds that have been withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.202" offset="8480162">Now, in the IANU case where the matter came before this Court after the decision in Zschernig, a dissent was written by Justice Douglas saying, we should -- this Court should not compel the applicant to go all the way down that the surrogate's court and come back up here again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.678" offset="8594056">In IANU, an application was made to the surrogate for the withdrawal of funds and the application which was made in that case by an assignee of a none resident alien was approved despite the fact that there was a conflict between the assignee and other claimant who have a power of attorney from the none resident alien beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.562" offset="8741595">The surrogate determined the dispute between the two conflicting claims and directed payment to IANU in the America state, IANU getting of the amount which was on deposit with the New York Surrogate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.200" offset="8812126">Now to a certain extent, the appellants here are pretty much beating a dead horse, because the talking about a situation to a certain extent which existed at the time of the complaint was filed in those actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.754" offset="11922369">But, the testimony has been there of a Professor Meyer of Harvard Law School who has been testifying on the basis of the fee of $500 per day for testimony to show that in these various iron curtain countries.</text>

            <text syncTime="3014.396" offset="12160920">The statute on its face contains no language, which might be considered any sort of animate version.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.141" offset="12195924">I think that the thesis which is submitted by Professor Farwell will indicate probably a response to the Chief Judge's question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3064.809" offset="12362585">We were prepared to show that even before the decision in the Zschernig case, that various surrogates throughout the state had upon appropriate testimony directed distribution of shares where the records in the cases before them warranted such disposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.231" offset="12596328">The moneys involved there where Hungarian moneys, but the situation has no different from that involved in this Romanian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.809" offset="12630601">Now, we believe that New York just like in other litigant before this Court is entitled to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.706" offset="12662157">Reversal of this decision would place New York where in a situation where it had not actually been granted the hearing as to how its statute was being administered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.408" offset="13725027">As the opinion was written in Zschernig by Mr. Justice Douglas, he indicated that when Clock against Allen as before this Court -- the only question that was before the Court in Clock against Allen just whether the statute that involved in that case was a statute with one valid on its face and it didn't have before the question of application of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.887" offset="13834951">And it seems to me that as the opinion is written, the opinion rests primarily with relation to the misapplication of the statute upon various law review articles which indicate such misapplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.569" offset="13905690">Now, that those law review articles including the one which was written by Mr. Meyer are not the product of our judicial system where you get into court and try a case and where you find out what actually happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.108" offset="14067754">Now, we believe that we are entitled to an opportunity not only to test Mr. Berman's testimony upon a trial but possibly has followed a job as Mr. Justice Douglas did in analyzing the law review articles at that time that perhaps Mr. Justice Harlan did his homework better.</text>
