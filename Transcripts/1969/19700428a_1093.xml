            <text syncTime="23.284" offset="196524">Mr. Friedman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="30.899" offset="226931">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.431" offset="241142">This is a direct appeal from the District Court for the District of New Jersey from a judgment of the District Court there which after trial dismissed a government civil antitrust suit challenging the merger of two banks in the town of Phillipsburg, New Jersey as violating Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.156" offset="332048">The appeal presents a number of important questions as to the standards to be applied by the courts in passing upon the application of Section 7 to small bank mergers and also as to the correctness of certain rulings made by the District Court in this case in upholding the community convenience and needs defense that Congress wrote into the Bank Merger Act of 1966 as a permissible basis of justifying anticompetitive mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.016" offset="471437">Before discussing the facts in these legal issues however, I just briefly like to explain to the Court why the Government considers this an important case and why the Government has brought to this case a factual situation and on its face does not seem to be of the greatest economic significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.609" offset="553775">Ten and 15 years ago, we had in this country a great wave of tremendous bank mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.843" offset="582719">Multibillion dollar institutions combine, institutions involving hundreds of million dollars combined in the large metropolitan areas, New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Houston and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.680" offset="634128">As a result of this Court's decision in 1963 in the Philadelphia Bank Merger case and a series of other decisions under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, the focus of the whole trend of bank mergers has shifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.326" offset="696717">Today, we no longer have this pattern of large bank mergers in the big city.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.572" offset="721690">Those seemed to be a thing of the past because under this Court's decisions, these combinations and these very large highly concentrated markets are illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.488" offset="765367">What we have instead is a developing trend of mergers along the smaller banks in the smaller areas and in the past four or five years, virtually all of the justice departments, bank merger suits have been brought against this type of merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.299" offset="844570">The reason we have brought these cases is we think that since in the smaller marketing areas, the very nature of banking tends to make it a concentrated market, a relatively small number of banks and since in the smaller communities, as I shall develop in the course of my argument, the people particularly affected the small borrowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.675" offset="934118">Most of the small banks tend to be primarily concerned with small customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.647" offset="953971">We think it's particularly important in these smaller markets to preserve for banking customers the available alternatives of choice that is to make sure that in these markets, they already tend to be concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.378" offset="1012903">They do not take place a large number of bank mergers which further reduce the available alternatives and that's why we think this particular type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.730" offset="1054281">This is the first case that has come before this Court involving so-called small bank mergers and that's why we have brought the case and we think it's an important case.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.531" offset="1309445">Most of the cases that we have brought and decided not to appeal have been cases in which a large bank from outside the immediate area has come in and acquired a bank in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.161" offset="1351973">The theory there being there was an elimination of a potential competition of the bank that came in acquired to merger.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="322.771" offset="1394500">I don't believe there have been any in which have actually gone into trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.833" offset="1410696">I think there are some that have been appending and I think there have been a couple in which we brought a suit in the merger terminated at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.896" offset="1442983">Now, let me with this background come to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.862" offset="1458866">Phillipsburg, New Jersey is an industrial community with a population of about 18,000 including the surrounding suburban area of the town that has 28,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.892" offset="1506931">It is directly across the Delaware River from the City of Easton, Pennsylvania, a larger city with a population of 32,000 and in the environs approximately 60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.200" offset="1556146">The two cities are very close together.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.251" offset="1564400">They are connected by two bridges, one of which is free and other of which has a charge for commuters of $2.50 crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.680" offset="1598046">There is a very close business and commercial relationship between the two towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.784" offset="1618526">People go back and forth from the two towns to shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.416" offset="1633050">People go back and forth to work and as a businessman in Phillipsburg described it, he said that the Phillipsburg-Easton area is in effect really is one town.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.891" offset="1674951">Like so many of the cities these days, the central areas of both of these communities have not had much growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.537" offset="1705566">It has become rather stagnant in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.665" offset="1714030">Its population has remained quite stable.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.223" offset="1724270">On the other hand, the surrounding areas have grown both in terms of population and industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.105" offset="1755826">The town of Phillipsburg has three banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.615" offset="1769827">The town of Easton has four banks, one of which is a branch of a bank in the Easton suburbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.746" offset="1798353">It is where the main office is located, a few miles away in the city, town of Nazareth, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.621" offset="1821863">The acquiring bank in this case, the Phillipsburg National Bank is the largest in Phillipsburg and the third largest in the Phillipsburg-Easton area in 1967 and these are the -- this is the latest date for which data are in the record, the assets were approximately $24 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.331" offset="1904724">It has its main office in the downtown part of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.293" offset="1916531">It has two branches in the suburban areas that had opened in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.337" offset="1936697">The acquired bank, the Second National Bank of Phillipsburg is the second largest in that town and the fifth largest in the Phillipsburg-Easton area.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.108" offset="1975777">It has assets of $17 million, a little less than that of Phillipsburg National.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.631" offset="1997928">Its main office in Phillipsburg is directly across the street from that of the Phillipsburg National Bank and it has one branch in the suburbs again across the highway from one of the branches of Phillipsburg National and it says apparent from the facts that these two banks are direct competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.872" offset="2074833">Both of these banks in recent years have undergone substantial growth and both of them profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.051" offset="2103568">In the 10-year period from 1957 to 1967, Phillipsburg National doubled its assets and deposits and tripled its loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.781" offset="2146513">In the same period, 1957 and 1967, Second National increased its assets 82%, its deposits 86%, and again tripled its loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.605" offset="2197817">For the years 1962 to 1967, except for one year in which Phillipsburg National showed a deficit because of various accounting changes that are employed, each year it had substantial profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.324" offset="2260720">As to taxes, they ranged from $46,000.00 to $123,000.00 and over that same five-year period Phillipsburg National paid total dividends of $192,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.971" offset="2311293">Similarly, the Second National Bank in this five-year period every year has substantial earnings ranging from $35,000.00 to $73,000.00 and it paid total dividends in that period of $198,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.137" offset="2371897">Now, both of these banks provide a full range of the traditional and usual banking services.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.198" offset="2396139">They accept demand deposits, savings and time deposits; they provided checking service; they make various types of the usual loans, commercial and industrial loans, mortgage loans, installment loans, consumer loans; they have safe deposit boxes, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.677" offset="2466043">Unlike the large city bank, however, these banks is apparently as typical of most banks in the smaller communities, have a much heavier percentage of their deposits in time and savings deposits and a much lower percentage of their deposits than the demand deposits because of the fact that this community just doesn't have the same kind of heavy industry that we have in the large cities and similarly, in terms of their loans, a much greater percentage of their loans were in real estate loans in the big city banks and a much smaller percentage in commercial and industrial loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.707" offset="2622151">The banking market in the Phillipsburg-Easton areas are concentrated one.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.871" offset="2642840">The two top banks, both in Easton have approximately 50% of the assets, almost 50% of the loans and 55% of deposits and when we take the three leading banks which include the Phillipsburg National Bank, it comes to roughly 60% of assets, 65% of deposits and 65% of loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.955" offset="2731238">Now, as I have indicated, there is a substantial extent of social and commercial intercourse between the two towns and in addition to that, there is a good bid of movement back and forth between the Phillipsburg-Easton area and the surrounding areas of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.455" offset="2801142">This was originally a rural farming country and as there's been increasing population growth and industry, a large number of smaller towns have developed and in fact the evidence shows that people who live in Phillipsburg-Easton frequently go outside of the area to work, that people who live in the outside area come to Phillipsburg, and that people from Phillipsburg-Easton go as far as Allentown and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 20 or 30 miles to shopping, but, and we think this is critical and I will develop it in more detail in a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.999" offset="2939382">The record shows that the two merging banks do the vast bulk of their business of all types in the Phillipsburg-Easton area.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.298" offset="2976580">Now, with this as the background, I'd like to come to the decision of the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.042" offset="3527555">And they do get, there is evidence that these outside banks do get trust business, of course, and this tend to be by enlarge the larger accounts, of course the trust business.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.007" offset="3567365">Now, the District Court in this case basically I think we can fairly say made about three or four rulings that are significant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.726" offset="3606235">The Court in this case said that because a large number of other financial types of institutions are competing in the area with the banks that the relevant market for testing competitive effect in this case was not commercial banking as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.943" offset="3691186">He pointed -- the district judge pointed to the fact the two had saving and loans association, the two had finance companies, the two had mutual funds that were seeking to obtain the savings deposits of the customers, the two had finance organization seeking loans and the Court, therefore, has concluded that the appropriate line of commerce for the testing the effect of this merger was those particular services rendered by the bank as to which really there was no significant competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.773" offset="3830471">And the services the Court included in its line of commerce with checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposits, personal loans, consumer and installment loans and commercial and industrial loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.714" offset="3890239">But then rather inconsistent with this theory when the Court came to evaluate the effect of the merger on competition by examining the concentration ratios and the increases in concentration, the court looked to the figures dealing with commercial banking, not with the subcategories of commercial banking which Court believed was the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.032" offset="3987519">So what it amounts to, it seems to us, it's really kind of a dictum, the Court said it didn't think that commercial banking was the relevant market then it turned around and in fact tested this by commercial banking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.903" offset="4862934">The merging banks had only six and three quarter percent of all banking assets and after reaching that conclusion, the Court then said that that far as it was concerned really was the end of the case, but since the convenience and needs pointed have been so fully canvassed, it would also rule on that, and it then held that the banks had sustained the burden of proving this merger was justified by community convenience and need relying primarily on two factors that the merger would result in the lend -- the new bank having a much larger lending limit than the old bank and that it would permit the bank for the first time to employ a full time trust officer which would enable it to build up a trust department for which it found there was need in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.573" offset="5061674">And in deciding the convenience and need point, rather interestingly and we think erroneously, although the Court had used the broad geographical market for determining competitive impact, it evaluated the needs of the community solely in terms of the needs of Phillipsburg, not Phillipsburg-Easton but just Phillipsburg.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.986" offset="5315271">The Comptroller held a hearing and after the hearing ruled that the merger did not have the anticompetitive effects primarily again because the Comptroller viewed the market much more broadly than the banking agencies have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.723" offset="5370232">Now, there's a -- the appellees argue at considerable length as to why commercial banking in this market is not the appropriate product and that the District Court therefore correctly rejected that line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.386" offset="5436897">At page 61 of their brief, however, the bank's record that the Government in any event hasn't been prejudiced by any possible error in this thing and they admitted the issue is no longer really in the case because of the fact that in deciding the effect on competition, the District Court did look to commercial banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.124" offset="5535848">We have briefly discussed in our brief the reasons why we think that in this case as in all the banking cases before this Court, commercial banking is an appropriate product market within which to test the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.859" offset="5594781">But in view of the fact, as I said that issue no longer really seems to be a real life or in the case, I think I will leave the discussion to our brief on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.500" offset="5645354">Now, coming to the first of the critical issues so far as the Government is concerned because we have to win on this case to seek, I would get a reversal here, and I might just add in passing that all we're asking this Court to do in this case is to reverse and remand to the District Court to reconsider the community convenience and needs defense under what we think is the proper determination that the merger had an anticompetitive effect in the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.135" offset="5771891">The -- this Court in the Pabst case recognized that just as with products so in the case of geographic areas there may be more than one geographic area that is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.653" offset="5826017">In Pabst, the Court recognized that there were three different markets, three large markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.005" offset="5847437">The District Court said here however that said that it concluded that the relevant market, that was the word used, “the relevant market” was this area that it had selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.333" offset="5888711">Now, there may be situations in which this larger market is an appropriate one for determining the effect of a bank merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.584" offset="5917759">If for example, we have a merger of a bank in Allentown with a merger of the bank in Phillipsburg, that would be the appropriate market but we think that for the purposes of determining the effect of this merger, these two banks in Phillipsburg, that Phillipsburg-Easton together is a relevant market within which to evaluate the effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.200" offset="6012217">In its Philadelphia bank decision, this Court stated that in determining the appropriate geographical market, the proper question is not whether parties to the merger do business or even where they compete, but where within the area of competitive overlap the effect of the merger on competition will be direct and immediate and I will now proceed to show that this merger will have a direct and immediate effect upon competition in the Phillipsburg-Easton area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.584" offset="6273755">All the statute requires where the effect may be and we think that if in fact, this has that effect in a relevant market, the merger cannot be saved because of the fact that the banks may be able to expand into the peripheral areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.339" offset="6344704">The figures we have, page 37 and footnote 29 of our brief, we have submitted a table which breaks down as between the different types of business, the sources of the merging banks business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.226" offset="6420250">The deposit and loan statistics there contained showed that the banks do roughly 85% of their business in Phillipsburg and Easton as I have previously indicated in answer to a question of Justice Stewart that there's very little in the way of solicitation outside the area and very comparatively little done outside and similarly banks outside the area generally do only solicit in the area on rare occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.981" offset="6535293">Indeed the business is even more localized than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.379" offset="6548877">It seems to be pretty much localized within Phillipsburg and within Easton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.120" offset="6567894">For example, each of the merging banks did only 10% of its business -- I'm sorry, got only 10% of its savings and time deposits from Easton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.943" offset="6619094">Statistics indicate that almost every one of the 85,000 families in Phillipsburg deals with one of the three banks in that area and numerous businessmen in Phillipsburg testified that they preferred to deal with a local bank in Phillipsburg than to go across the river to Easton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.472" offset="6697253">It's not surprising that this business is thus localized because the vast bulk of the customers of these two banks are small people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.250" offset="6736332">In terms of the number of deposits of these banks just under three quarters of a total number of deposits are less than a $1,000.00 and 96% of them are less than $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.895" offset="6790980">Again, in terms of loans, the percentages are somewhat smaller but nevertheless quite strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.344" offset="6812714">Phillipsburg National had roughly three quarters of its loans for less than $2,500.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.287" offset="6840508">Second National had 58% and when you get to loans of up to $10,000.00, 86 and 94% are less than $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.444" offset="6885125">Now, as this Court recognized in the Philadelphia Bank case, these figures actually reflected the realities of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.998" offset="6931414">Banking is essentially local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.054" offset="6939564">It's locally oriented and particularly so for the small customers and convenience, the convenience of access to have your bank near you is the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.874" offset="6982823">The merging banks indeed themselves recognized this because as the suburban communities developed four or five miles outside the center of Phillipsburg, they open branches as there as the vice president of Phillipsburg National explained, they said that's where the customers are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.172" offset="7056071">And furthermore, the vice president of Phillipsburg National pointed out in response to a question that a great many of the loans that they make in this small town are based primarily on the character of the borrower and he said that a man where you have a loan made on a character basis, the people in Phillipsburg would find it very difficult to obtain a loan in any area outside where they weren't known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.273" offset="7176443">Now the -- the banks themselves in their business have recognized the integrated, localized character of the Phillipsburg-Easton market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.209" offset="7220224">Phillipsburg and Easton are in different federal reserve districts which means that normally, their checks would clear from different federal reserve clearing house banks and this would obviously cause a considerable problem so what they have done is they have established something they call the Easton-Phillipsburg clearing house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.705" offset="7302144">Each every three months or so, one of the banks in this area takes it turn to act as a clearing house for all checks drawn on banks in the Phillipsburg-Easton area and the president of the largest bank in Easton in discussing this arrangement said and this is in page 140 appendix, he said, this arrangement, I quote, “seems to be another fact which indicates a closely-knit community even though separated by the Delaware River.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.254" offset="7424397">Another indication of the integrated nature of this banking community is the fact that for many years, banks in the surrounding area outside the Phillipsburg-Easton area were paying 4% on savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.056" offset="7491584">At the same time, the Easton banks were paying 3%, the Phillipsburg banks 3.5% but in 1968, when one of the banks in Easton increased its savings rate to 4%, very quickly, all the rest of them followed suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.699" offset="7578206">Now, the significance of all of these facts of localization comes down to this that this indicates to us that this is the area where the effect of the merger will be primarily felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.632" offset="7633899">These are the people, the people who deal with these banks, who give their business there from whom the banks derived a vast part of their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.412" offset="7665037">These are the people to whom the elimination of an alternative source of banking will be hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.801" offset="7694608">These are the people who are going to feel it and this is in effect in the language of the Philadelphia Bank case is where the merge would have a direct and immediate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.874" offset="7734836">The basic error of the District Court, we think, was its refusal to recognize the significance of this considerations and instead its reliance on the fact that there is a great deal of business and worked mobility within the broader area, that is people will drive 15 or 20 miles to go to work, people will drive as far as Allentown and Bethlehem to shop but this case, of course, is dealing with the effect of this merger on banking not on other businesses and the fact that a man is willing to drive 20 or 25 miles to work, to buy a new suit of clothes, to buy a new sofa doesn't mean he's willing to drive 20 or 25 miles to bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.476" offset="7921246">Indeed, all the indication in this record is to the contrast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.555" offset="7941622">Now, I'll just briefly like to refer to one contention that the appellees make here in their brief which is that in any event, whatever else you may think about our market, Phillipsburg-Easton is not an economically significant area of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.870" offset="8006823">I take it the argument is too small and therefore cannot be a relevant section of the country within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.907" offset="8042977">They rely primarily on the fact that prior to 1950, the Clayton Act spoke of an effect, an adverse effect on competition in any community or section and that in the 1950 amendments of the statute, the word “community” was deleted and they rely on a colloquy before the Senate hearing at which Congressman Celler, one of the sponsors of the Act, engaged in a long discussion with Senator Donald and they picked certain language which they suggest indicates that really Congress never intended to permit this small an area of the country to be relevant section of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.180" offset="8212041">Now, for whatever this kind of legislative history is worth, the testimony given before a Senate Committee by a member of the House who was one of the principal sponsors of the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.099" offset="8255718">We don't think it proves what the defendants believe it proves because at the end of this long colloquy, what comes out of it is that Mr. Celler said he believed that the phrase, “section of the country” means any trade area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.359" offset="8316844">That's what they were talking about that one of the statute to be able to reach a trade area and we think that this area, Phillipsburg-Easton certainly is a significant trade area in terms of commercial banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.259" offset="8372433">Within the Phillipsburg-Easton area, we think that under this Court's standards that it has applied for determining competitive effect in horizontal mergers, the effect of this merger may be substantially to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.357" offset="8432828">As I have previously indicated the market in this, the banking in this area is concentrated, we have filed with the Court, this Xeroxed document which is a substitute for a chart we have at page 13 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.771" offset="8506493">Unfortunately, in preparing the chart on page 13, we derived some of the figures from the wrong exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.287" offset="8532511">The figures given in the narrative on the following page 15 are correct but we have just reproduced this to give the correct figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.414" offset="8577024">The market -- the three largest banks in the area, as I've indicated, have approximately 60% of the total assets, 70% of the deposits, 65% of the loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.609" offset="8633762">The result of this merger would be to make the new bank, the Phillips -- combination of Phillipsburg National and the Second National, the second largest bank in the area, it would have approximately -- it will have 19.3% of all the banking assets in the area $41 million, 23.2% of the deposits $38 million and 27% of the loans which is almost $25 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.817" offset="8742640">The share -- total share of assets held by the three largest banks would increase as a result of this merger almost 12% to 68%, that is from 60% to 68%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.164" offset="8804080">The deposits would increase to almost 80%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.238" offset="8816306">And after this merger, the three largest banks would control three quarters of all the banking offices in the area, 12 out of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.436" offset="8857161">Now, of course, that's the impact of this merger Phillipsburg-Easton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.035" offset="8879522">The impact of the merger in Phillipsburg itself would be much, much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.796" offset="8898539">There, what we would have, is you'd have one bank with 75% of all the business, three times larger than the other banks, and this would eliminate for the people in Phillipsburg one of three banking alternatives and I think the anticompetitive effect of this merger in the Phillipsburg community is rather dramatically illustrated by the fact and I have to preface this by saying we did not make this argument in the District Court by the fact that under this Court's decision in the Grinnell case, it would seem that a combination which gives the combined firm 75% of the market violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act because you've got in one hands three quarters of the markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.129" offset="9087875">Certainly, that is enough to control prices and exclude competitors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="2341.003" offset="9467382">-- on the competitive effect, we think the standard is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.622" offset="9489847">Now, I have one other fact which unfortunately we have not referred to in our brief but I think is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.901" offset="9514924">While we do not have in this market anything like the history of mergers that we had in the Philadelphia Bank case and some of the other cases, we do know and the record does show that the largest bank in Easton is the result of a merger in 1959 which point two banks with assets of $25 million each who joined to form this bank which in that time since then has grown 50% to its present size of 74 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.278" offset="9644492">Now, I'd like -- I may then identify but I think it will be appropriate to just read, the Court is thoroughly familiar but the -- we think the facts I've demonstrated bring this case within the rule announced in Philadelphia Bank where the Court said that a merger which produces a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market and results in a significant increase in the concentration of firms in that market is so inherently likely to lessen competition substantially that it must be enjoined in the absence of evidence clearly showing that the merger is not likely to have such anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.289" offset="9796524">Now, if we're correct in our conclusion that this merger is bad in terms of its anticompetitive effects under these standards, then it seems to me, the decision of the District Court must be vacated and the case remanded to that Court, because the Court's balancing test that any anticompetitive effects were clearly outweighed by the community convenience and need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.830" offset="9906657">It seems to us is vitiated when the Court has incorrectly calculated one side of the scales, as again in National Bank, the Court recognized, it said, to weigh adequately one of these factors against the other requires a proper conclusion as to each and we don't think the Court's conclusion if the very end of its opinion where the Court said at page 699 of the appellant that even if there were de minimis anticompetitive effect in the narrowly drawn market proposed by the Government, such effect is clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community deserved by the merged bank constitutes an adequate evaluation of this factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.031" offset="10087528">It is not the kind of careful balancing that Congress intended before an anticompetitive merger could be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.306" offset="10120547">And therefore, we think the case has to go back to the District Court as in National Bank properly to perform the balancing function but since the District Court undertook to determine convenience in need and since on a remand, the issue would again arise, we have fully discussed this issue and we think it is appropriate for this Court to consider it but we think the District Court committed two basic errors in applying the convenience and needs standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.573" offset="10233710">First, we think it used the wrong market area, and secondly, it misapplied the convenience and need standard in several particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.734" offset="10270281">The particular provision, the convenience and need provision, is set forth at the bottom of the page 61 and the top of 62 of our brief and what it says in effect is that where a merger has the effect of -- may effect -- may substantially lessen competition, it cannot be improved unless the Court finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed, clearly outweighed and the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.</text>

            <text syncTime="2642.762" offset="10674448">But it seems for us for this comparison to be a meaningful one, the community benefits resulting from the merger have to be assessed in the same area as the community detriments also resulting from the merger because in both instances which we're considering are the banking needs of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.126" offset="10763891">In the one hand, you look to the banking needs to determine what the area is where the merge will have its effect and then you look and turn around on the other side and say what effect, favorable effect on the same banking needs will the merger have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.141" offset="10827943">Now, to be sure, they may be situations in which a merger will have an effect, a beneficial effect upon a segment of the community and that beneficial effect on the segment of the community, we're down to that benefit of the entire community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.798" offset="10914565">But it does seem to us that while that is permissible, you cannot properly evaluate and sustain a community needs defense on the basis of benefits to a narrow segment of the community that do not benefit the entire community which is the relevant area for testing the impact of the merger upon competition and that we think is just precisely the situation we have in this case in terms what we think is the relevant market, the Phillipsburg-Easton market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.794" offset="11070568">The Court as I have indicated relied upon two factors primarily as in a ground for sanctioning this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.833" offset="11106722">First, the higher lending limits that the larger bank would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.765" offset="11122395">The bank's lending limits turned upon its capital surplus, sometimes retained profits, and so on and of course, every time you combine two banks, you get a larger lending limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.224" offset="11168266">Each of these banks had a lending limit of approximately $100,000.00 when you combine them with various accounting adjustments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3712.386" offset="14952887">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.846" offset="14966784">I would like to first primarily address myself to the needs and the facts of the merger and the relevant geographic area particularly as it applies to the new banking, new laws in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.720" offset="15026239">To the appellant's contention that the District Court applied erroneous standards in assessing the convenience and needs and to the appellant's contention that the merging banks and the District Court failed to adequately consider the less anticompetitive alternatives to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.096" offset="15115786">But before I do that, if I may, I would like to make a comment or two on some of the answers to questions that Mr. Friedman made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.497" offset="15157373">First, we disagree and I disagree, that the District Court ruled that commercial banks was a line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.192" offset="15184123">I believe that the District Court recognized the fact that there were at least banks performed various functions that demand deposits alone perhaps was the only line of commerce but in New Jersey, savings banks also have the demand deposit function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.781" offset="15250474">But the District Court as I analyze this his opinion, stated they haven't proved their case and didn't really attempt to say this is the -- first, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove this case, to prove that their commercial banking is the line of commerce and the District Court felt that because of all these other alternatives that were available and the testimony adequately showed that they were in competition with all these other areas specifically in the savings alone and savings bank where there was so -- that these banks that were so predominant in savings and in lending for residents that these people did compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.402" offset="15417031">However, he didn't have to come out and make a determination that this is in competition, this is in competition, this is in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.246" offset="15448377">As I interpret he said, they haven't proved the case that this is -- that commercial banking is a line of commerce and instead it -- and didn't state all these other functions were in competition with commercial banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.330" offset="15504697">One other comment Mr. Friedman made was that the recent antitrust cases, recent in the banking field, did not involve smaller banks, that this is the first smaller bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.767" offset="15574392">Large banks are no longer -- have no longer been merging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.637" offset="15593932">This is isn't quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.137" offset="15603963">Crocker-Anglo case which was subsequent to the Nashville case and subsequent to the Philadelphia National Bank case involved the merger of the bank, the result of bank at $4 billion in assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.765" offset="15658402">So that's a pretty substantial size bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.984" offset="15671359">The First National Bank of Jackson involved approximately $350 million bank acquiring a bank with assets of about $26 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="3942.596" offset="15873755">So it isn't quite true that the mergers of the large banks have ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.645" offset="15901968">All of these cases were decided all of these cases were dismissed by the District Court and decided in favor of the defendant banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.366" offset="15924851">Most of these cases involved potential competition as opposed to what we are dealing with here as a horizontal type of merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.496" offset="15965393">There was some horizontal aspects to a couple of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.148" offset="16024012">A comment Mr. Friedman made with respect to the reports of the various banking regulatory agencies, I would like to comment that the Bank Merger Act provides that these agencies must report, if it's the Comptroller of the Currency involved in the merger, must report to the Comptroller of the Currency only on the competitive effects not on the convenience and needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.260" offset="16120456">They do not and are not to consider the convenience and needs, so all they get is a half a picture when these regulatory agencies report to us or we report to them, the losses report on the competitive effects as you see them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4310.289" offset="17344554">The commercial and industrial business done by these banks is insignificant, especially when you compare this with that done by large commercial banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="4363.198" offset="17556146">In fact, their demand deposits range anywhere from two-and-a-half to five times the amount of savings deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.456" offset="17585194">The reverse is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.177" offset="17592090">Phillipsburg National's savings are two-and-a-half times its demand deposits, quite a different type of business, a different locality, a different community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.495" offset="17669308">Certainly, Phillipsburg National and Second National cannot be judged in the same manner as those large urban banks and I've made a comparison of those banks on exhibit, intervenor exhibit number one and are listed the various assets of these banks and Phillipsburg's trust assets would be $41 million as compared to the smallest bank there with $336 million some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.453" offset="17789158">Concentration and the restraints of trade in large urban areas with such billion dollar and multibillion dollar banks or at the minimum banks with approximately half a million must certainly be viewed differently than the situation these two banks are in.</text>

            <text syncTime="4546.200" offset="18288201">In Philadelphia National Bank case, when the Court turned to -- this Court turned to the justifications advanced by the defendant banks, is said that the banks do not contend, that is -- that is Philadelphia National and Gerard do not contend they are unable to compete without the merger, however, in this case, Phillipsburg National and Second do so contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.231" offset="18400319">The testimony in this case was to the effect that the only possible way for these two banks to grow was by merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.243" offset="18428322">It could not be possible by internal expansion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4615.426" offset="18565099">Officials of Second National stated the growth that their bank had leveled off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.000" offset="18587355">There was other testimony to the effect that any growth by these two banks would be limited to the possible growth of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.122" offset="18623822">The banks are separate and that they have no future, it would not be able to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.157" offset="18652035">In the Philadelphia National Bank, this Court said that that was not a case where two small firms in the market proposed to merge in order to be able to compete successfully with larger corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.531" offset="18705533">However, Phillipsburg National and Second National do so contend in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.008" offset="18731447">They are two small banks desiring to merge to better compete in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.161" offset="18759973">There was testimony at the trial of three experienced officials of larger banks to the effect that the merger would intensify competition between Phillipsburg and Easton banks and it would eliminate the existing apathy in banking competition in the area and that the merger would be pro-competitive and benefit the community with better personnel and extended services.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.761" offset="18898422">There was an abundance of evidence to the effect that the merger would enable the resulted bank to hire the needed personnel and to give the services that are needed to make them an aggressive competitor in the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="6041.079" offset="24267734">Discussion to meet the problems that existed as between older management and younger management as to how we could serve the customers in the neighborhood, the people who were in need of loans to finance various enterprises, all of those problems were taken into consideration and it was felt that this was the only way that we could meet the problem so we discuss merger and then in 1967 signed an agreement and then filed an application with the Comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.120" offset="24419871">The three agencies, not through their somber boards but rather through a bureaucratic employees took the narrow blind view that only Easton was a market or Easton and Phillipsburg was a market, that they submitted that various reports but then there was a full and adequate hearing before the Comptroller, justice shows not to appear on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.009" offset="24531362">Then we produce witnesses and then a decision was arrived at that this was an area somewhat similar to the standard, metropolitan statistical area which is set forth in white in this exhibit, exhibit 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.074" offset="24603669">Then we found that after we are ready to go with the merger, justice starts a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.219" offset="24640240">Then we go to the District Court in New Jersey where we have 1600 pages of testimony, where we have over 100 exhibits, where we're put to untold difficulty in getting out records as to duplicate depositors in each bank, furnishing infinite information then the judge became ill after the conclusion of the case and we waited a year for a decision and now this suit is here before you.</text>

            <text syncTime="6175.972" offset="24807215">There isn't one witness, least of all Mr. Lupo who says that this is anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6183.990" offset="24839293">At most he said in -- and I refer you to the appendix in page 35, in the record it's probably page 134, he was asked about the competition between his bank, that is the third largest bank and two existing banks in Phillipsburg and he said, “I would say it was healthy competition, healthy competition to the extent that we have grown, that we have recognized and we have progressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6216.098" offset="24967816">I would say it was healthy competition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.557" offset="24977638">And the Court, “When you defined it as healthy competition, do I understand correctly that you consider this competition as a factor in your own growth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.403" offset="25012955">Then I say to you, if you read the record 1600 pages, you can not find one of the people who as bankers appeared on the scene to say that this was anticompetitive, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6244.909" offset="25082964">The -- the -- we'll take Mr. Greenly of the second largest bank in New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="6257.714" offset="25134268">He pointed out that there was no premium on any of the exchange of shares like there was in the national case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.271" offset="25164466">He pointed out that there was a fair exchange and that it was -- there was nothing about it that would cause customers to have to pay the toll or pay anything additional.</text>

            <text syncTime="6503.299" offset="26116577">Yes as was -- as was pointed out in Nashville and Philadelphia, two banks will be better able to compete with other banks in any of these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.035" offset="26167463">Now, let's just take the standard metropolitan statistical area that you have the large banks in Allentown, you have the large banks in Bethlehem, you have a large bank south of us and no one in Phillipsburg can get a loan in excess of $100,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="6535.062" offset="26243636">He's got to go to the other neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.835" offset="26254712">Now, he can get a larger loan and I think it was recognized in the Nashville case that the Bank Merger Act of 1966 did remedy that situation, that situation of larger loan limit and the Philadelphia National Bank case was sort of held out because it was felt that the Bank Merger Act prevented them, the Bank Merger Act of 1960 but the Bank Merger Act of 1966, I think, by the Nashville case indicated that it could -- that would be one of the factors and another factor would be the management, a better opportunity to hire employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.185" offset="26412074">Now, the record here demonstrates that the president of the Second National is well over 80 and the next man is 71 or 72 and the man after that is 39 or probably 40, 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="6595.089" offset="26483754">The head of the Phillipsburg National Bank is now about 73 and the next man is about 61, 62 who wants to retire early and you come down to the next level, it's about 40 and 39.</text>
            <text syncTime="6615.793" offset="26566510">Now, Chinamann (ph) who represented the largest bank, south of Oxley, the Huntington County National Bank said it's too late to go out and try to do it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.983" offset="26619277">You have to have a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.696" offset="26626173">A Greer of the Lafayette Trust Company, a former bank examiner who was pulled in as a young man and he has done a good job for Lafayette Trust says he wants to go to the $50 million in Easton and he says he can't do it without a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6647.068" offset="26691688">Now, let's look at geographic area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.982" offset="26707257">I think this Court recognized in the Philadelphia National case that they would take the four county area where the banks were permitted to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.899" offset="26762951">Now the judge in this case, Judge Sheldon, at the time of the hearing of this case, Lafayette Trust recognized that there was pending in the state legislature an amendment of the state banking law which would allow and which subsequently was enacted, it allows in seven counties of New Jersey branching, branching by merger or de novo with certain home office protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.378" offset="26888861">Seven, counties, the complete northern, the majority of the state with over three million people an area very much like that which was adopted in the Philadelphia National Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6708.401" offset="26936926">Now, this is the kind of competition we're likely to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="6711.819" offset="26950614">Now this applies just to a branch banking or merging.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.721" offset="26986245">But there's statewide bank holding so that you can have any bank picked up by a bank holding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6730.177" offset="27024071">In addition to that, it includes savings banks as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.696" offset="27046118">In addition to that, it includes savings and loans which can move into the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.447" offset="27073181">So you see how extensive the competition is and already Warren County has this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6810.695" offset="27346108">That is the way they got a good deal of their money and Walmer Trupke (ph) who is an expert here has testified said that only about 10% of the finance companies get their money from the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.768" offset="27390412">Now, I'm talking about the finance there -- three, two types of finance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6825.236" offset="27404309">There's the finance company that takes care of inventory machinery and appliances something like GMAC, GAC, CIT and that type of outfit or the subsidiaries of General Electric and their appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.977" offset="27471287">That's the one face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.206" offset="27476198">The other is the small loan companies which are at a very large outfit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.493" offset="27501380">So you see, what I'm just going to say now about the Warren County situation we're part of this seven county area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.094" offset="27547773">They're closing in on us and they're closing in on us this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6865.383" offset="27564910">Shortly, after this suit was started, there was a merger between the Washington Bank in -- the Hackettstown Bank, pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6874.628" offset="27601899">That was the Warren County National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.431" offset="27617050">That's now being taken over by the largest bank in the state First National Bank, state bank, that's all in the exhibit -- intervenor's exhibit 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.131" offset="27659891">So those two banks went into a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6891.653" offset="27670026">They are going to be taken over by a bank holding company, the biggest bank in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.262" offset="27692387">Then there's the Washington Trust Company which is 12 miles away from Phillipsburg and which had a branch in Oxford and one in White Township and that's being taken over by the National Newark and Essex Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.205" offset="27760201">This is a bank with just about 14 to 15 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.280" offset="27788518">National Newark and Essex is about the third largest bank in the State of New Jersey operating over Newark.</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.027" offset="27811506">The only other independent bank we now have in Hackettstown, that's being taken over by the Peoples Trust Company at the Hackensack Bank which is about number five bank in the state of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="6944.960" offset="27883186">Now, if you look at the intervenor's exhibits, you will see very clearly that they allow this sort of thing just as say its vital right for the National and Newark Essex to come in and take the Washington Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.537" offset="27953507">Under their method of approach, they probably say it's alright, come and take one of the three banks in Phillipsburg.</text>
