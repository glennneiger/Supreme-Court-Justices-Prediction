            <text syncTime="52.722" offset="314284">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.090" offset="331734">The question in this case is the meaning of a standard clause in Federal Government construction contracts which provides in pertinent part as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.959" offset="375202">The contractor, the construction contractor, shall be responsible for all damages to persons or property that occur as a result of his fault or negligence in connection with the prosecution of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.691" offset="434134">The Court of Appeals for the Firth Circuit has upheld the dismissal of the Government's complaint for indemnity under this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.253" offset="464436">Holding what this responsibility clause makes -- leaves the United States solely liable for any injuries that arise from concurrent negligence on both part of both the United States and the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.081" offset="519711">In other words, the Fifth Circuit has read this clause is relieving the contractor of any obligation to indemnify the United States unless the contractor's negligence in the sole and exclusive cause of injury.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="116.471" offset="569240">It might even stand, that the clause doesn't say anything about in indemnifying anybody?</text>

            <text syncTime="123.760" offset="598392">Though if its -- it is the Fifth Circuit did treat it in general as an indemnity clause same would operate as an indemnity clause, if an only if the contractor with the sole cause of the injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.009" offset="655444">Well, it could be argued --</text>

            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="138.439" offset="657115">It's true that the clause does say responsible not -- it doesn't use the word indemnifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.032" offset="683551">Now, I will pursue that point a bit further on.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.162" offset="704031">As I say, we submit that this was wrong and that the responsibility clause must be read as shifting to the contractor as its words say and specifically under the facts in this case, full responsibility to pay all of the damages caused by its negligence regardless of the fact that the United States may also have been negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.375" offset="784906">Certainly, we believe it was improper for the courts below to dispose of this case on the pleadings without a trial in which the various pertinent facts relating to the contractor relationship between the parties and the facts of the accident itself could be explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.323" offset="856691">The basic facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.787" offset="874559">The Seckinger Company had a fixed price construction contract with the Navy Department in an amount of roughly $650,000.00 for the construction of outside steam pipes of the Paris Island Marine Depot in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.784" offset="946552">Ernest Branham was an employee of Seckinger who has a welder and steamfitter.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.817" offset="966614">On the day of the accident, Branham was working on a steam transmission plate that is being installed above ground across one of the streets at the base at a height of about 16 feet above the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.818" offset="1030666">A day or two before, the stretch of pipe crossing the street had been put in place on its supports by a crane.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.669" offset="1066088">But on the day of the accident, Branham and another worker were making certain adjustments in the positioning of the pipe in preparation for welding into the pieces of pipe on either side of the street to which at least to be connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.841" offset="1130768">Branham was working shortly before the accident on one side of the street and other man was working on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.957" offset="1163160">The construction foreman in charge of job, who was of course an employee of Seckinger, noticed that the man on the other side was having some difficulty and he directed Branham, the employee, to go over and help him.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.544" offset="1217599">In order to get there, Branham did not climb down to the street and walk across the street, but instead walked across the pipe itself which was about 20 inches in diameters.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.437" offset="1273083">And as he came near to the place where the other man was working, where he was to help him, he bumped into an uninsulated power line which was running -- which was strung along poles the normal way running parallel with the street at the edge of the -- at the sides.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Van R. Springer</label>
            <text syncTime="314.371" offset="1360854">That was a Government-owned power line which one of the regular lines which provided power into the base.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.113" offset="1391783">I believe it was undisputed in that trial that this power system covered about a third of the whole base.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.027" offset="1443506">The pipe -- the wire was about four or five feet above the top of the pipe and as I say when Branham got to the other side where he was going, he bumped into the pipe and the shock knocked him off the pipe and he fell to the street which was 16 or 17 feet below and he was of course seriously injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.340" offset="1536711">Branham collected workmen's compensation from Seckinger under state law and also being unable to collect anything more from his employer, he sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act and the District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.832" offset="1606719">After a trial, that Court found that the accident had been caused by negligence on the part of the Government and awarded Branham damages in the amount of $45,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.723" offset="1658232">Specifically, the Court in that case found that the United States had been negligent in two respects. One or the other of which had found it caused the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.805" offset="1694595">First, it found that Government's construction inspector who was in general supervision of the job was negligent in failing to have the law -- the power line de-energized before Branham was sent to by the foreman to work near.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.710" offset="1770245">And secondly, the Court found that the same inspector had negligently failed to warn Branham of the danger of the wire.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.738" offset="1810369">The United States in that action in South Carolina filed the third party complaint against Seckinger in which it sought indemnity under the responsibility clause that are referred to saying that any injury to Branham was caused by Seckinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.593" offset="1873795">The contractor's own negligence and therefore the United States should not bear the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.645" offset="1905977">The South Carolina District Court dismissed that third party complaint without prejudice on the theory that trying it in that case would unduly complicate the proceedings there.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.030" offset="1951535">So accordingly, the United States had to bring and did bring a separate action, this case against Seckinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.837" offset="1990719">It was unable to sue Seckinger in connection with this case in South Carolina, so the case comes here from Southern District of Georgia to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.333" offset="2028753">The Government's complaint in the indemnity suit like the third party complaint that had been dismissed alleged that Branham's injuries were caused the negligence of Seckinger's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.462" offset="2077236">In particular, tracking the findings of the South Carolina District Court which had held the Government liable the complaint alleged as follows as to the failure to de-energize the power line, the complaint alleged that Seckinger, the contractor, was responsible for requesting that the power be turned off before it sent Branham to work near the wires or else that Seckinger should have either put some insulation on the wire itself or requested the Government to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.241" offset="2200325">And as to the second element of negligence to the South Carolina District Court had found, the complaint alleged that Seckinger should not have directed Branham to work near the wires and should have prevented him from proceeding in a dangerous manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.671" offset="2282036">$45,000.00, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.434" offset="2293112">Therefore, this complaint alleged Seckinger's negligence was the cause of the injuries to Branham and the contractor responsibility clause made Seckinger solely liable for them and therefore Seckinger should indemnify the United States for the damages that were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.527" offset="2361448">The Government was prepared to prove these allegations of course of the trial, although it never had the chance to.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.027" offset="2387466">It was prepared to prove not only that Seckinger was negligent and that that negligence caused the accident, but also that the circumstances were such that Seckinger was primarily negligent and the Government only secondarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.763" offset="2454444">If -- as the South Carolina Court had held, the Government should have turned the power off.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.283" offset="2476492">The relationship between the parties was such that the Government could rely on Seckinger, the contractor, to inform you when it was necessary to turn the power off.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.231" offset="2512332">In this regard, the Government would show that Seckinger had a full-time foreman on the job at the time of the accident as the contract required, whereas the Government's inspector who was charged only with inspection of the performance under the contract was concerned with not only with this job but with another number of other jobs going on at the same time and in fact it was not present at the site of this job when the accident occurred, but was somewhere else supervising another job.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.310" offset="2640645">As to the Government's breach of its duty to warn Branham that the South Carolina District Court have found, the Government would further have relied, have been able to have a trial on its indemnity claim on the specific instructions that were given Sekinger in the contract to assure safety and the specific --</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.891" offset="9710947">As a taxpayer, I would certainly prefer for the Government to have included an indemnity clause, so that the exchequer would not bill out the entire $45,000.00 but we've got to accept the clause as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.925" offset="9791091">And the clause as it is we maintain does not provide for a situation where the Government is negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.308" offset="9832573">It's $45,000.00 negligent and wants to get it back from Seckinger, the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.298" offset="9884609">Now, nothing in this paragraph says a word about hold the Government on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.729" offset="9934242">That is found in a lot of indemnity clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.381" offset="9952946">It's found in a lot of leases where the owner is held harmless and if there is negligence, one party fix it up and pays the other party back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.757" offset="10014386">This, we think, is a basis for the distinction between indemnity and responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.211" offset="10048240">There's nothing in there that says we'll indemnify the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.565" offset="10069661">There's nothing in the heading that says permits responsibilities and indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.325" offset="10100694">How can it be said that this contractor when he went and signed at the place he was supposed to sign and the Government contract intended to pay back the Government for a $45,000.00 of their own negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.362" offset="10204871">It doesn't say anything about we will pay the Government each share of damages in the event the Government is held responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.711" offset="10242173">This would be one more sentence which would knock out argument in the head but it's not fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.215" offset="10276237">It's a mere responsibility clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.807" offset="10294627">The Government in its brief prefers to call it an indemnity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.328" offset="11204733">But it was brushed aside in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.724" offset="11218317">But just briefly on the Ryan Doctrine, Ryan was the employee of a stevedore who had the operation of the whole ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.146" offset="11279966">He's charged with loading that ship right but the Ryan doctrine has nothing to do with this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.554" offset="11445582">But certainly, if contractors are required to go on to a Government installation and to indemnify the Government for it's negligence that's going to be a much higher bill for Government contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.071" offset="11547669">The Government is urging the position that although that negligence was $45,000.00 worth and was sufficient to sustain the verdict for $45,000.00, we the contractors have to pay him back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.096" offset="11631783">This is a long and hard burden for a contractor to assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.235" offset="11660309">And I don't know how many or how the dollars would work out but certainly it's arguable that it would cost the Government more money to require indemnification from this plumbing contractors and alike that go along the Government installations to do their work than it would to redraft the clause and to say in effect we expect such and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.721" offset="11794265">From all of those standpoints the matter should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.993" offset="11823313">This contract also puts the Government in a very involved position as far as inspecting the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3117.095" offset="12571773">Granted and the Ryan line of cases doesn't in some sense set a background for our statement that what we say in this clause means is not extraordinary because at least in the Ryan or whatever area Ryan covers, the Government contractors have been given by implication what we say here we are entitled to by a natural reading of the clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.097" offset="12807711">And I believe that everything I've said even what I've said about what we would prove with due process really just me talking at this point since we haven't had a chance to make a record on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.624" offset="12853896">Everything that on that is at least consistent and I believe supported by testimony in the transcript of the earlier trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.575" offset="12897677">As I understand Mr. Kennedy's argument, it's primarily that this clause should not be considered as speaking for the matter of indemnity at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.891" offset="12946892">Of course then, in that respect, he departs from the view that the Fifth Circuit itself does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.673" offset="12970088">I think it's plain that the Fifth Circuit regarded this as some kind of indemnity clause, it simply held that it wasn't an indemnity clause which would extend to this kind of case where the Government was negligent or also negligent but I think that Fifth Circuit agrees with us at least to the extent of saying that this is where we look in this contract if we want to know what kind of indemnity there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.890" offset="13082937">As to the historical origins of this clause, I think it is, as I understand the situation that prevailed prior to the Tort Claims Act, it is not strictly accurate to say that the Government was never subjected to tort liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.396" offset="13140929">I believe what normally happen was that Congress would pass a private bill or this has happened to a number of cases which in effect amounted to an ad hoc Tort Claims Act, giving the Court of Claims jurisdictions to adjudicate whether or not the Government should be liable, so I would think that that kind of situation could well have given rights to a situation where the Government had been held liable and would want to look somewhere for indemnity.</text>
