            <text syncTime="65.908" offset="367052">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.359" offset="384815">This case is concerned with the single aspect of the proceedings under a voluntary petition for corporate reorganization originally filed in 1954 pursuant to Chapter X of the Bankruptcy law by the debtor, Hancock Trucking Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.408" offset="476975">In the petition, Hancock alleged that it was unable to meet its debts as they became due and requested the appointment of a trustee to operate its business and manage its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.244" offset="528384">The respondent here is that trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.727" offset="546252">The claims of the United States against the debtor are for unpaid income withholding, employment and excise taxes in the total amount of more than $375,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.852" offset="614797">Because of the narrow focus of the questions presented by the Government's petition for a certiorari, little of the lengthy history of these reorganization proceedings need be recounted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.600" offset="669759">The issues in this Court concerned an amended plan of reorganization filed by the trustee in June 1967 and approved by the courts below over the Government's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.023" offset="735483">The amended plan reflected in agreement approved by the District Court and by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the sale of the debtors principle asset, its Interstate Commerce Commission operating rights for truck freight services to Hennis Freight Lines Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.290" offset="820537">The purchase price of $935,000.00 was to be paid in accordance with the schedule requiring $300,000.00 to be paid within 90 days of the Commission’s approval of the sale and the balance in 78 monthly installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.724" offset="902248">The amended reorganization plan reflecting this sale agreement did not contemplate that the debtor Hancock Trucking would continue to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.776" offset="954493">The amended plan is in effect a liquidation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.979" offset="975287">The Government made no objection to the terms of the sale agreement, its objections relates solely to the provisions for payment to creditors in the amended reorganization plan.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>

            <text syncTime="319.193" offset="1380185">The Government contends that the provisions for payment of creditors in the amended plan do not satisfy its statutory priority of payment rights and the respondent trustee admits in its brief that the Government is entitled to priority but contends that its rights are fully satisfied under the plan and that is the issue is this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.380" offset="1504841">The contested plan provides for an initial payment of 100% of certain wage claims and certain state and local tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.027" offset="1555519">20% of the claims of the general unsecured creditors which is all they will receive and 10% of the Government’s tax claims and of the remaining state and local tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.960" offset="1627199">The remainder of the amount due to the Government and to state and local tax authorities was to be paid in 78 monthly installments secured by an assignment of the note and chattel mortgage Hennis had executed on its purchase of the debtor’s operating rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.294" offset="1712567">This amounts to an initial payment on the Government’s total claim of some $375,400.00 of approximately $37,500.00 and 78 equal monthly installments thereafter of approximately $4,330.00 each.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.429" offset="1809115">No interest was to be paid on the monthly installments which together with the initial payment would simply total the $375,400.00 owing to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.292" offset="1868570">As we point out in our brief, at the time of the initial payment when lower ranking creditors were to be paid in cash the discounted present value of the right to these future payments to the Government plus the initial payment to the Government would amount to approximately $317,000.00, some $58,400.00 less than the $375,400.00 owing to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.678" offset="2014124">The Government's position is that this does not satisfy its priority rights not because the Government has a right to immediate payment of all cash that is on hand up to the limit of its claim in a Chapter X proceeding which we do not urged and not because the Government has a right to the payment of interest for any part of the post petition period preceding cash payment to lower ranking creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.404" offset="2144946">We recognize that there isn't a right to such interest on the Government’s claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.210" offset="2168247">Our contention is simply that the Government as a priority creditor cannot be required at the time when non-priority creditors are being paid in cash to accept IOU's payable only in the future the part of its claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.087" offset="4503698">It’s just what is meant by priority that's being contested here, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.036" offset="4547480">Well, our claim is that as a priority creditor admittedly a priority creditor the Government cannot be required when the lower ranking creditors are being paid in cash to accept a deferral without interest of a portion of its payments or they put the matter in other way we contend that no lower ranking creditor can over the Government’s objection be paid until the Government’s claims have first been satisfied which is what we understand to be the normal meaning of priority in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.444" offset="4717171">In the alternative, we do contend that the Government has at least entitled to interest from the time of the payment to the lower ranking creditors until the time of the deferred payment to it to compensate it for the deferral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.238" offset="4784358">But out principle contention is that the Government as the priority creditor should not be the one to bear the risk that the deferred payments will not materialized but should instead be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.206" offset="4872234">In making our contention, we rely on several different guide posts because as I have already said Chapter X does not include a specific comprehensive provisions setting for the hierarchy of priorities as Section 64 does for ordinarily liquidating bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.857" offset="4970768">The most venerable source of the Government's priority rights in this case is Section 3466 of the revised statutes which is on page 41 of our brief and in Title 31 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.279" offset="5040462">This provision originated in acts of Congress of the late 18th century which they had their roots in the sovereign priority of the crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.061" offset="5083617">The statute expressly provides that the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied whenever as is the undisputed case here that debtor is insolvent and has committed an act of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.782" offset="5158536">Decisions of this Court as cited in our brief have established that tax debts owing to the United States or among those covered by the broad language of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.501" offset="5213393">The plan upheld by the courts below plainly does not comply with this statutory requirement of the Government's claims shall be first satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.245" offset="5260309">And there is on the face of things no reason why this provision is not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.346" offset="5284760">It manifests the continuous congressional policy that the claims of the federal treasury and the important public needs to be served by the funds in that treasury are to be placed ahead of the also just claims of unsecured creditors who did business with the debtor for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.259" offset="5380368">In light of this important public purpose of the priority statute, this Court has repeatedly said that only the plainest inconsistency would warrant the finding of an implied exception to the clear command of Section 3466.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.758" offset="5454451">It was said most recently in United States Department of Agriculture against Redmond in Volume 330, United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.618" offset="5489873">These considerations and others led the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to conclude five and a half years ago in a thoughtful opinion by Judge Reeves that Section 3466 is fully applicable to Chapter X proceedings that's United States against Andersen which is discussed in our brief and the same conclusion had earlier been reached by the Court of Appeals for the Second and Third Circuits in cases cited on page 13 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.011" offset="5627382">This Court has not previously had occasion to decide whether this provision is applicable to Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.795" offset="5662595">The court below came to the contrary conclusion that Section 3466 is superseded by the provisions of Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.901" offset="5719019">And our contention is that the other Court of Appeals were correct in deciding that this statute is entirely compatible with Chapter X and we go beyond that and contend that the provisions of Chapter X themselves in the light of their legislative history and as interpreted by this Court independently provide a priority right for the Government’s tax claims which the plan here did not satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.738" offset="5850363">The principle provision in Chapter X that is pertinent is Section 199 on page 42 of our brief and the second sentence is the pertinent language beginning at the end of line 7 of Section 199.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.855" offset="5934791">If in any proceeding under this Chapter, the United States as a secured or unsecured creditor on claims for taxes or customs duties and the parenthetical may be omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.305" offset="5992573">No plan which does not provide for the payment thereof shall be confirmed by the judge except upon the acceptance of the lesser amount by the Secretary of the Treasury certified by the Court followed by a proviso which is irrelevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.698" offset="6074180">Nothing in this language which gives the Secretary the right to demand or to forgo full payment is inconsistent with the command of Section 3466 as to the relative priority of that right to payment as against other claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.564" offset="6149622">The command of the Government's claim shall be first satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.735" offset="6170311">The history of the evolution of Section 199 recounted in detail in our brief shows that Congress knew that Section 3466 had been applied in equity receivership proceedings involving insolvent corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.139" offset="6239901">And that in enacting the statutory successors to equity receivership which culminated in Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.956" offset="6275218">Congress manifested no intention to diminish the Government's priority rights and rejected a specific recommendation that is do so, but instead was concerned to provide for protection for the Government in Section 199 not only as insolvent debtors to whom Section 3466 applies, but more generally, as to all debtors involved in Chapter X reorganizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.031" offset="6403532">Of course Congress also provided specifically in Section 199 in its predecessor that the Secretary of the Treasury may compromise the Government's rights and in appropriate cases this enables the Secretary to contribute to Chapter X’s objective of fostering rehabilitation of the debtor when feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.146" offset="6503946">But the granting of this power to compromise does not imply that the rights themselves are diminished and as I already mentioned on the face of the statute -- this language providing for payment is the only language used when Congress wish to provide for a priority right in Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.527" offset="6593494">And in any event the contrast within Section 199 between payment and acceptance of a lesser amount shows to us under face of the statute that the Government’s rights were not satisfied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.167" offset="6660054">There is another basis for the decision of the court below namely the provisions in Chapter X requiring that the reorganization plan be fair and equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.679" offset="6718046">But these provisions do not lead each District Court free to get a fact to its own notions of what is fair and equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.714" offset="6754200">In this field, the words “fair and equitable” are terms of art which acquired their meaning through judicial interpretations in equity reorganization proceedings that is what this Court held with respect to Chapter X unanimously in opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.281" offset="6836537">And one aspect of the meaning of fair and equitable is broadly stated that creditors of a junior class may not be given something of value at the expense of non-consenting creditors of a senior class so called rule of absolute priority which we believe as equally applicable to the difference between the Government’s statutory right to full payment and the claims of creditors who do not have such a right as it is to the classes of creditors to which it has been applied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.751" offset="6994422">But whether or not, the decision below actually violates the fair and equitable provisions of Chapter X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.726" offset="7022320">Those provisions surely do not justify the refusal of the courts below to afford the Governments the rights specifically granted by Sections 3466 and 199.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.501" offset="7153351">It's always been my view that all cases ought to be viewed in the light of their facts and certainly it's true in this instance in an equitable proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.677" offset="7206118">The facts are more fully elaborated in our brief but there are some highlights and I think should be brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.213" offset="7236211">It's true that this case in May of 1954, the original plan was confirmed in 1957 under the terms of that plan without going into details.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.601" offset="7305801">The reorganized debtor took over the assets and property from the trustee in June of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.189" offset="7340178">It began operating without a control of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.258" offset="7372361">In December of 1961, the trustee filed a petition for final decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.484" offset="7401305">Hearing was to be held on that in March of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.954" offset="7427218">In February of 1962, there became a change in the directors, the corporation had had financial difficulties and they then entered into a contract of sale with Hennis Freight Lines for $1 million principal and interest included over a period of time of 78 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.695" offset="7534111">Prior to the hearing on final decree, three creditors who had come into being subsequent to the reorganized debtor taking over the assets asked the court to have the trustee retake the property and assets alleging insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.358" offset="7616763">This took place hearing was held and the court vested the trustee with the assets and property of the debtor corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.991" offset="7663365">Investigations are placed to trustee then moved to affirm the contract of sale with Hennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.529" offset="7693458">The court affirmed that contract in August of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.338" offset="7716760">It took three years for the Interstate Commerce Commission to finally approve the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.316" offset="7740688">When it did approve the sale, it entered a restriction upon the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.851" offset="7766810">Now, the restriction have entered was a sort of limited restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.456" offset="7785200">It did not include a reduction of mileage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.359" offset="7800769">The original contract provided that should the ICC reduced the mileage then Hennis would be entitled to a reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.344" offset="7848730">There was dispute between the trustee and Hennis as to what the price should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.491" offset="7873285">We finally reached an agreement whereby the maximum amount of the sale was to be viewed as $935,000.000 instead of a million and again is inclusive of the interest payable over the same period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.335" offset="7948727">Then in addition, the trustee would offer in the plan a 20% compromise to unsecured creditors and any reduction of price would rip down then to Hennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.852" offset="8022810">Now, that of course are the facts right bearing up to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.491" offset="8045380">The plan then of course was approved subsequently hearing on approval subsequent hearing on conformation, the plan was confirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.532" offset="12261543">Remember now that the United States on the bankruptcy shares equally with the remainder of the taxing authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.720" offset="12330297">At the end of January 1975, in other words about four and a half years, the United States then gets paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.249" offset="12372407">So it takes four and a half years under bankruptcy for the United States and the other taxing authorities to be paid in full.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.678" offset="13718131">We're not talking about non-tax debts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.800" offset="13726595">We're talking about the priority granted by 199 because all of these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.409" offset="13769017">I think the question of the interest is important only from one reason if I am correct that just thought of these proceedings and continuing on, there's only one step in the way than the Saper case applies and the Edens case applies and the Government is not going to be entitled to the interest on its money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.105" offset="13847803">And for that reason, I contend that it isn't discount and true one more thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.458" offset="13869223">There isn't any question that if interest has to be paid the United States then it has to come out of the pockets of the general creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.375" offset="13904854">Now, that to me is the real crux of it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.149" offset="13931917">If there are no further questions from the Court, I will rest.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3461.759" offset="13950412">Thank you Mr. Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.121" offset="13959816">Do you have any thing further counsel?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3468.523" offset="13977475">I would just like to make two brief points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.504" offset="13993357">In the first place, it seems apparent to us from counsel's own chart that somebody is taking something away from the United States in this case compared to what we would have had in a liquidated distribution where the initial payment would have been $160,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.200" offset="14072142">Now, it’s $37,500.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.547" offset="14093563">It's not fair and equitable under established principles for the priority claimant to have to suffer the expense of giving something of value to claimants with less priority against its will.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3512.273" stopTime="3523.443">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="3512.273" offset="14152495">It rather begs the question, doesn’t it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.973" offset="14159287">I mean, that you assume as the result must be exactly the same in Chapter X is it isn’t straight bankruptcy and that is the question to this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="3523.443" stopTime="3613.255">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3523.443" offset="14197112">Well, this is not my assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.293" offset="14212577">The contention is being put by the respondent that this is the appropriate comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.981" offset="14235251">I wish to point out also that depending on the cost of administration perhaps the unsecured creditors would in fact eventually get more but then that some really should be discounted by the period of waiting for it in addition to taking into account the risk that it will not materialize which would be born by unsecured creditors in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.543" offset="14341517">Now, this Court has recognized in a recent opinion, Mr. Justice White’s Protective Committee against Andersen that in Chapter X there is authority in the Secretary of the Treasure to bargain to compromise and that bargain and compromise among claimants place a very important role in accomplishing the objects of Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.917" offset="14447052">And while it may seem that in this case we are arguing for a rigid rule of priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.111" offset="14475786">The fact is that it is the priority that gives the Secretary to bargaining power to induce others to enter into these compromises and accomplish the objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.417" offset="14521031">We did bargain previously and accept the plan in 1957 in this very case which shared our rights with others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.312" offset="14552586">Thank you.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3613.255" offset="14556348">I don't know whether this record contains it but is there any indication of what the discounted value of $375,000.00 paid over that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.914" offset="14595009">I suppose it's somewhere 7 years somewhere on $225,000.00 at 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.813" offset="14622595">So, in effect, the Government is saying to us I take it that as a matter of judgment being aside of priority judging the equitable aspect of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.040" offset="14675571">The Government's preference is to get $60,000.00 now then $225,000.00 over period of seven years with the attendant risks that they might not get all of it</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3657.232" offset="14732309">That is correct sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.769" offset="14742444">Our own contention would have been that we should be paid now what was being paid under the plan that we have the right to be paid what was being under the plan to the junior creditors rather than this particular comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.529" offset="14793540">We would look at the distribution as being made under the plan and certain of those we had a right too if we insisted on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3680.912" offset="14826977">Suppose it's not relevant here but from what you said before I take it that some plan less than the distribution under bankruptcy but more than the one offered might have been acquiesced by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3702.316" offset="14912658">We did previously acquiescence such a plan 1957 in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.753" offset="14934392">At that time, that plan had rehabilitative purposes and that is a factor in our acquiescence.</text>
