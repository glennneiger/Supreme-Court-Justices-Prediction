            <label>Mr. Francis X. Dineen</label>
            <text syncTime="23.203" offset="196211">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.407" offset="208959">My name is Francis X. Dineen.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.820" offset="218676">I represent the appellants in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.191" offset="236126">Jurisdiction of this Court has invoked under 28 United States Code, Section 1257, Subsection 2 because of the fact that the constitutionality of a state statute as an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.511" offset="285445">And by the decision of the appellate division of the State of Connecticut, the constitutionality of that state statute has been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.714" offset="322226">The Supreme Court of Connecticut denied our petition for certification and so the appeal to this Court is from the appellant's division of the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.376" offset="368828">The facts of this case involve a relatively ordinary eviction action which was commenced in July of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.832" offset="414699">Thereafter, pleadings were filed and defenses were raised and in fact seven special defenses were raised to the eviction action that was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.897" offset="459003">In January of 1968, a trial took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.854" offset="474781">On January 16, judgment was entered for the landlord, the Housing Authority of West Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.055" offset="503620">Thereafter on January 18, our appeal from that judgment was filed with the Appellate Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.894" offset="538937">At that time, pursuant to Section 52-542 of the Connecticut General Statutes, it was required that we file with the court a bond with a surety to cover the rents that might accrue during the pendency of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.259" offset="616364">And in order to file that bond, on behalf of our clients, we went to several surety companies asking them what they would require to go on the bond as a surety.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.517" offset="665475">The bond in this case because the rent was $72.00 per month would have been approximately something in the nature of $400.00 to $500.00 or even more dollars for this bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.520" offset="713435">In fact, that case that we have cited in our brief, in which the rent was approximately the same as our rent, the trial court had ordered that a bond in the amount of $700.00 be filed in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.485" offset="761292">So that in any event, our bond would've been something in the nature of $500.00 to $700.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.343" offset="784697">And this again, is to covered the rents that would accrue during the pendency of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.947" offset="811133">The surety companies that we approached asking that they own this bond with us, demanded full cash collateral before they would sign a bond as well as demanding their fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.867" offset="854810">This was impossible for our clients to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.508" offset="869439">They were poor and they didn't have that kind of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.996" offset="883336">So, we went to the trial court and by motion on our client's behalf to waive the surety bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.529" offset="913533">We stated these facts to the trial court and asked that as an alternative in order to protect the landlord during the pendency of the appeal that we be allowed to pay the rent into the Court every month to be held by the Court in escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.813" offset="978631">And we also agreed that in the event that we should loss the appeal and ultimately if the Supreme Court of Connecticut heard it and lose there, but this body then will be turn over to the landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.570" offset="1021680">We also agreed that if any one month we fail to pay that rent into the Court that the appeal could automatically be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.240" offset="1060342">Now, we thought this was a fair alternative because the increase of the state has in protecting the landlord would be met entirely by this provision by this alternative that we offered if we pay the rent to the Court every month as it came due.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.869" offset="1118856">And if we fail any one month and our appeal would then be dismissed, the landlord would have all the protection that he would be entitled to.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.785" offset="1146546">Is it clear Mr. Dineen that the Court have the power by way of equity, discretion or some other source to waive the bond requirement and accept your alternative proposal?</text>

            <text syncTime="275.946" offset="1207150">Your Honor, it appears to us that it's clear that they did not have that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.932" offset="1231078">The reason I say that, we cited in our appendix the appellate court decision and on page 57 in the appendix where we recited the decision, the court says, the right to an appeal is a not a constitutional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.257" offset="1296384">Though one based upon privileges of natural justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.900" offset="1306937">It is but statutory privilege which an aggrieved party has the right to avail himself of only when he is strictly complied with the provisions of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.377" offset="1344867">And later, on page 60 of the appendix, the Appellate Division says, "Want a bond with surety, where a bond with surety is by statute a prerequisite of review furnishes a sufficient ground for dismissal of the appeal."</text>
            <text syncTime="327.854" offset="1414771">We made the motion in the trial court because there had not been a decision such as this with regard to waiving a surety bond prior to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.568" offset="1453641">We made it because we felt when we're offering a fair alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.743" offset="1474330">It turned out from our understanding now of the Appellate Division's decision that the Appellate Division decides that it does not have the power to waive this --</text>

            <text syncTime="409.333" offset="1740675">There're Connecticut statutes Your Honor that require that any building that is considered a tenement house or a garden type apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.956" offset="1775156">And these are -- they find in Connecticut statutes, must have what is called a tenement house certificate stating that that building complies precisely with these tenement house laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.095" offset="1815803">And if it does not have a tenement house certificate, then no rent is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.151" offset="1831999">And under a case cited I believe in our jurisdictional statement, Creamy Hollow Apartments against Louis, no special proceeding or some reprocess action can be brought when such a house does not have this tenement house certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.018" offset="1883408">That was one of our defenses as to the claim for rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.540" offset="1897514">There was a second defense and that relates to the first action that was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.593" offset="1913710">There was an action brought some two months or three months before the second action which is an issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.654" offset="2154036">Now as to that question, there's no required in Connecticut law that in order to defend or to litigate in a summary process action, if you have to pay any rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.119" offset="2203878">In fact generally, when a summary process action is commenced, the landlord will refuse to take any rent because this would be a waiver probably of his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.935" offset="2247137">Litigating and defending an eviction action is not conditioned in Connecticut upon paying current rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.350" offset="2272737">Connecticut law does not require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.768" offset="2282454">And this particular factor, we don't feel as relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.437" offset="2301158">In other words the fact that for several months, from July until January rent was not paid is not relevant to the issue that we presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.283" offset="2340551">If we had paid the rent in full, every month as we went along during the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.712" offset="2366255">We still would have come to the same problem that we came to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.996" offset="2379316">We would've come to the time of a appeal where we would have had put up this bond with a surety.</text>
