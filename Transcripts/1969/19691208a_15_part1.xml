            <text syncTime="29.588" offset="221706">My name is Peter Baird and I represent petitioner and this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.447" offset="237171">The case before you is on writ of certiorari to the Arizona Supreme Court and it concerns a refusal to admit petitioner to the practice of law in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.404" offset="276982">She has graduated from Stanford Law School, she has passed the bar examination and the refusal stands upon her refusal to completely fill out a questionnaire and affidavit prescribed by the Arizona rules of the Supreme Court of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.713" offset="338213">There are two particular questions that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.578" offset="353677">First is the question she did answer and this was question 25 and we set it for on page three of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.604" offset="381785">This is and I quote, "List all organizations, associations and clubs other than bar associations of which you are or have been a member since attaining the age of 16 years."</text>
            <text syncTime="81.542" offset="429537">This petitioner did, she listed each and every organization to which she has belonged.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="86.756" offset="450435">Mr. Baird, I saw that in the brief and then I looked in the appendix and I found that the form in the questionnaire was there but I didn’t see the answers that she gave to that question or did any other question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter D. Baird</label>
            <text syncTime="102.495" offset="513337">Mr. Justice Stewart, we do not have as part of the record the answers to the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.186" offset="536116">That is part of the committees’ files and they were not introduced so far as I know before at the Supreme Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="114.788" offset="562552">And how do we not then know so far as the record goes that she did fully answer question 25?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter D. Baird</label>
            <text syncTime="120.772" offset="586480">We alleged that in our verified petition before the Arizona Supreme Court and so far as I know this was not denied and the refusal to admit petitioner is expressly based by the committee upon her refusal to answer question 27, not question 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.709" offset="658160">Question 27 reads as follows --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="140.134" offset="663907">I just think it just appears to me and maybe I'm quite wrong and in the course of your argument, maybe you’ll persuade me so, but that the validity of the refusal to answer question 27 might depend upon what answer was given to question 25 and we don’t know what answer was given to question 25.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.636" offset="757948">That is true, as part of the record you do not know the names of the organizations to which she has belong which she did list.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter D. Baird</label>
            <text syncTime="173.067" offset="795669">Her question, question 27 reads "Are you now or have you ever been a member of the communist party or any organization that advocates, overthrow of the Untied States Government by force or violence."</text>
            <text syncTime="185.643" offset="845928">There is --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="186.014" stopTime="188.651">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="186.014" offset="847391">Would you say that's one question or more than one question?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_d_baird" startTime="188.651" stopTime="226.752">
            <label>Mr. Peter D. Baird</label>
            <text syncTime="188.651" offset="857945">I would say Mr. Chief Justice that really is two questions, one which overlaps with the first question which she answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.208" offset="888247">In other words the reference to communist party would show up in the question which she did answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.496" offset="909354">If she had belonged to the communist party, it would have showed up in response to question 25 and there is no contention I might add parenthetically that any of those really is a communist party.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.786" offset="954493">So the essence of her refusal goes to the requirement that she characterized.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.121" offset="979884">The group she belonged to and listed in response to 25 as to whether they do advocate the overthrow of the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.752" offset="1010395">Your brief as I followed your arguments in the brief places a great deal of emphasizes on the invasion of the petitioners right of free political association but may I ask you this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.927" offset="1071104">Do you include the second half of that question that is the question addressed to whether there is membership in any organization advocating the overthrow by force of the government as an invasion of politically, constitutionally protected right to political association?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_d_baird" startTime="261.510" stopTime="262.983">

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="262.983" offset="1155323">Then that means you contend that there is a constitutional right, guaranteed and protected right to overthrow the government by force and violence?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter D. Baird</label>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="275.771" offset="1206418">Well, I hope sometime while you're on your feet you'll explain that to me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_d_baird" startTime="279.704" stopTime="426.269">
            <label>Mr. Peter D. Baird</label>
            <text syncTime="279.704" offset="1222196">I will -- I shall do it right now as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.716" offset="1242258">The question as to forcing her to characterize whether any of the groups that she has belonged to is advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force and violence requires her to state whether under the Smith Act as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.193" offset="1308191">Any of them actually does advocate the overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.793" offset="1322506">Now, the burden upon the petitioner is significant in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.785" offset="1342464">It requires her to make various value judgments under the Smith Act and therefore would make her less likely to join these organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.178" offset="1376110">As to whether membership per se, in this kind of an organization is unprotected conduct, I think that under the decisions in Elf Brown and perhaps in Robel that one must actually have a specific content to overthrow the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.308" offset="1440580">Be an active member, know that the organization advocates the overthrow of the government and share that purpose before that association or status maybe proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.140" offset="1491884">The most significant aspect of question 27 apart from the freedom of association aspect is the purpose for which question 27 is asked and this is extremely important in the freedom of association area where the burden in not upon the applicant to state why she shouldn't have to answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.238" offset="1580283">The burden is shifted to the state to come forth with a compelling state interest to say why she should answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.948" offset="1607137">The compelling state interest which the state has come forward with in this case and presented to the Arizona Supreme Court is and I quote as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.616" offset="1645798">"Unless we are to conclude that one who truly and sincerely believes in the overthrow of the United States Government by force and violence is also qualified to practice laws in our Arizona Courts that an answer to this question is indeed appropriate."</text>
            <text syncTime="401.290" offset="1708492">The committee again emphasizes that a mere answer of yes would not lead to an automatic rejection of an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.115" offset="1735868">It would lead to an investigation and interrogation as to whether the applicant presently entertains the view that the violent overthrow of the government is something to be sought to be sought after.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.888" offset="1778918">If the answer to this inquiry was yes then indeed we would reject the application and recommend against submission.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="426.269" stopTime="436.763">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="426.269" offset="1808488">Don't you think that this question would be a similarly inappropriate to ask a candidate, an applicant for a job as a police officer?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_d_baird" startTime="436.763" stopTime="615.069">
            <label>Mr. Peter D. Baird</label>
            <text syncTime="436.763" offset="1850389">If the purpose was to seek not the conduct of the police officer but rather his political beliefs and views, I would say that it would be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.223" offset="1888214">This Court has almost an unbroken chain of precedence saying that belief is absolute Mr. Chief Justice, and I would submit that in any situations except those involving absolute discretion would be a point to uphold the public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.310" offset="1944639">The beliefs or brainwaves of an individual are not the concerned or the business of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.616" offset="1969821">It seems to us that the case really is controlled by Speiser versus Randall.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.733" offset="1994271">In that case where a tax exemption was depended upon the execution of an affidavit stating that the applicant did not advocate the overthrow of the government, this Court inferred in holding that that denial of the tax exemption was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.983" offset="2063339">That there was a frank aim at suppressing dangerous ideas and therefore it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.057" offset="2095626">We say that our case is even stronger, the right to practice law which has been described by this Court as far back as 1867 as a right is much more precious than a tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.205" offset="2144214">In our case we need not infer an assault upon political belief, it is frankly out in front of us by the expressed statement and very candid mission of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.687" offset="2186115">The affect upon holding that belief is a valid subject of inquiry for the state bar or for any other government institution seems to be involved in a tremendous amount of deterrence, of thought control.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.393" offset="2248913">Of perjury problems if the person is under oath as to how do you known whether an individual is telling the truth with respect to matters of the mind, I guess one of our basic points in this area was made in 1867 in ex parte Garland where a former confederate member of the confederate core sought to be a lawyer and was barred because he could not take the oath of office required of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.585" offset="2345671">This Court and holding that to be a Bill of Attainder said that the right to practice law can only be deprived of by misconduct consisting of moral or professional delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.574" offset="2393631">This point was also referred in Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners where it was noticed that it would be important that the petitioner there actually participated in some unlawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.647" offset="2445981">We believe that disbarment in the criminal law sanctions are sufficient to present any sort of threat which is posed by ones mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.212" offset="2480253">In function, this question 27 is really a test oath because it is not a conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.602" offset="2505749">It is not asked for the purpose of finding out whether an individual engaged in unlawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.561" offset="2529573">It is asked for the expressed purpose of finding out whether one has an intent which is to overthrow the government of the United States.</text>
