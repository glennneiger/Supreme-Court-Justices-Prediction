            <label>Mr. Harold Edgar</label>
            <text syncTime="21.264" offset="188479">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.977" offset="199241">This case concerns the very limited purposes for which assignments may be made of benefits payable under the upland cotton program. More particularly, it concerns whether the Secretary of Agriculture may disregard the considerable legislative and administrative construction of the statutory phrase “making a crop” and redefine it to authorize assignments for the purpose of paying rent for land.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.478" offset="297253">Prior to his change from regulations such assignments were prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.883" offset="314911">Petitioners, tenant farmers who were hurt by this change and regulation in a manner I shall develop brought suit in the middle of the District of Alabama seeking a declaration that the change in regulation was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.456" offset="365171">The district judge held that they have no standing to raise the claim and that in any event it was not meritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.685" offset="394115">The Fifth Circuit affirmed on grounds of standing alone, this Court granted certiorari last June.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.541" offset="429537">I'd like to begin by showing how the changed regulation harms petitioners, tenant farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.871" offset="454823">They farm the land in the traditional pattern of the southern cotton farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.849" offset="470810">They stay on the same year here at the same land year in and year out, some have been into farm all their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.912" offset="502993">Some 61 years, the shortest named petitioner has been there for over ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.189" offset="524100">What they do is at the beginning of the year they file -- they make a rent note with the landowner and that rent note gives them the right to use the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.952" offset="563179">It also normally provides for the landowner paying them small advances to pay for food and clothing while the crop is being grown.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.127" offset="607901">And the landlord for this gets both the right for the rent at the settlement date which is after the crop is in and at that time the advances are repayable with interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.479" offset="653249">However since the tenant farmers do not have any credit standing in the community, typically they are forced to buy all of the seed and tools that they need to make their crop from the landowner who extends them credit and charges prices more higher than the prices that are charged in the community at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.264" offset="724407">Moreover, interest is payable in that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.474" offset="737259">So it turns out that at the end of the year they have to pay their rent for all their purchases in the interim and typically they have nothing left and this goes on year in year out.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.225" offset="792221">Now the upland cotton program promised a somewhat better deal for petitioners in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.225" offset="828270">What it did is it authorized in Section (d) 13 that payments made under the program could be assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.251" offset="856377">Now the assignment is a right to get credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.529" offset="865468">I mean if you can assign and get credit, people know in the community that you have a definite amount of federal funds coming in, you can avoid the necessity of buying all your goods at the stores maintained by landowners and you can thereby perhaps save some of the money, so that at the end of the crop season you will have some money left.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="211.022" offset="947493">You said Mr. Edgar that people know in the community you have a definite amount of funds coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.643" offset="965987">Is it known in advance just what the figure will be?</text>

          <turn speaker="harold_edgar" startTime="218.477" stopTime="242.441">
            <label>Mr. Harold Edgar</label>
            <text syncTime="218.477" offset="977272">It is not known exactly in advance what the figure will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.715" offset="990229">It depends on the amount of cotton that's grown and the amount of land that's diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.120" offset="1011858">The land diverted is a fixed payment and it doesn't -- you're not growing any crop on the land diverted therefore that amount will be fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.819" offset="1038608">The actual price support is predictable by knowing the typical yield rate in the area but it's not by any matter of means a definite figure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="242.441" stopTime="244.025">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="242.441" offset="1073089">Exactly predictable.</text>

          <turn speaker="harold_edgar" startTime="244.025" stopTime="480.869">
            <label>Mr. Harold Edgar</label>
            <text syncTime="244.025" offset="1079463">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.211" offset="1092211">Now, if they also Your Honor what they can do is that they can start cooperatives as they have done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.864" offset="1118856">Tenant farmers can get together and by pulling their credit resources they can buy and they can purchase at far less than the cost which they are now paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.874" offset="1154905">Now if the landlord, if they can assign these payments to the landowner for whom they rent, they in effect lose the right -- the credit the Congress intended for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.658" offset="1202030">The landlord simply insists that the assignment be made as additional security for renting the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.344" offset="1224704">In that case he cannot use any of the credit that Congress has provided for his benefit and so far as he is concerned, Congress might as well not have passed Section (d) 13 which did grant farmers this right of assignment with a purpose of creating credit for small farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.718" offset="1306206">Now, the Government doesn't deny that this is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.687" offset="1318118">What happened in this case was that the landowner told petitioners that either they made an assignment or they got of the land and that two or three of them refused to make the assignment, they were thrown off the land, they were deprived of their allotments which are tied to the land and they were left without effectively any source of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.713" offset="1386245">The others made the assignment but then they were deprived of the credit as I say which Congress provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.176" offset="1408084">Now the Government -- respondent does not challenge that this is in fact what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.376" offset="1424906">It just says that it's not -- the fact that it's happened does not suffice to warrant granting relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.068" offset="1451656">The question then is whether Congress permitted this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.203" offset="1464195">A relevant statutory language is found in Section 8 (g) of the Soil Conversation and Domestic Allotment Act which provides for assignments for the purpose of making a crop.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.445" offset="1505155">There are three considerations we think that preclude interpretation of this language to encompass assignment for the purpose of paying rent for land.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.819" offset="1538696">First, the structure of the statute itself; second, its legislative history demonstrating a congressional intent to use the phrase as a limitation on assignment rights; and finally administrative construction given the term which from the moment of enactment in 1937 has precluded until the change regulation here challenged any assignments for the purpose of paying rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.180" offset="1628139">First, the structure of the statute, it provides for assignments to secure cash and advances for the purpose of making a crop.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.850" offset="1662725">Now only in the theoretical economist's view is securing use of land in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.515" offset="1689475">Normally advances mean goods that are supplied to you on credit, so the language of the statute does not seem to be looking to assignments for the purpose of paying land rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.480" offset="1737331">Secondly the legislative history, we suggest of the Soil Conversation and Domestic Allotment Act confirms that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.873" offset="1782888">The Act was passed as a compromise provision as an amendment report by a Conference Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.186" offset="1812146">The House Bill permitted assignments for all purposes but only to landowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.987" offset="1835342">The Bill was twice introduced in the Senate, a broader assignment bill permitting assignments to anyone and the Senate refused to pass it because it provided insufficient protection for tenant farmers from being forced or from being -- either by their economic circumstances or their own lack of prudence from making inadvisable assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.319" offset="1928652">So the Senate rejected the Bill twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.834" offset="1938683">In Conference Committee the Bill came forth but it came forth limited by these provisions that are designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.089" offset="1971702">One of those protections is the limitation of the purpose of assignments to making a crop and making a crop is not a term of common usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.592" offset="2013706">It's also a technical agricultural term and we believe—</text>

            <text syncTime="587.154" offset="2451937">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.226" offset="2456325">We believe that the Fifth Circuit decision was simply -- was erroneous in denying standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.787" offset="2490493">We believe that the source of confusion there was that they analogized this case to the case of the competitive interloper.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.255" offset="2516407">Most of the cases that have raised severe standing problems in this Court are those who are persons who is not -- whose conduct is in no way described by a statute challenges the action of someone else who is under some form of statutory limitation and urges that the statutory limitations that govern the other persons conduct are not being carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.649" offset="2609925">This is not such a case at all, for example if the Secretary of Agriculture had instead of expanding the purposes for which assignments might have been made, might be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.080" offset="2659662">If he had simply said no assignments shall be made at all, it seems that the petitioners are surely entitled to come to court and challenge his construction of his duties under the statute and simply saying that it will not be -- the statute will not be given effect and there's no -- from the point of view of standing, doesn't seem to us that there's any difference if he is cutting back power to assign or expanding where it is clear that the purposes that the congressional reasons which underlay the imposition of the restrictions on standing were precisely to benefit tenant farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.756" offset="2810441">In the same way that settler of a spendthrift trust imposes the limits on his spendthrift trust to protect the beneficiary against his unwise judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.387" offset="2856939">Surely for example, just as a matter of common law, the analogue, the common law, an interest protected at common law the strictest standard that this Court has ever used in standing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.807" offset="2898631">Any trustee who informed the beneficiary of spendthrift trust that he was simply going to disregard the terms of the trust the beneficiary would have standing to seek removal of the trust and we suggest that even under the common law right analogue that this case -- there is standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.207" offset="2964250">There is also clearly standing under this court's holding in Hardin.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.508" offset="2977416">The Hardin case two terms ago, there the court said that there was standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.785" offset="3002493">Standing did exist when a person was a member of a class whose interest Congress had sought to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.276" offset="3032482">Now as we say the legislative history of Section 8 (g) is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.230" offset="3052335">It emerges as an assignment -- broad assignment provision, the senate rejects it precisely because it is too broad and it manages to get approved with narrow limitations on the purposes for which assignments may be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.684" offset="3118059">That is the only grounds upon which the approval, the congressional approval was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.731" offset="3138330">So we think in light of that it's clear that these tenant farmers are within the class that Congress had intended to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.683" offset="3174066">Furthermore, that is that conclusion is particularly strong, seems particularly mandated, in so far as this Court has often said that there ought to be a presumption that administrative action is judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.262" offset="3220459">Now no one else can have standing in this case but petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.664" offset="3241984">In other words a landowner who is harmed, who thought himself harmed would have no standing to raise the claim pressed here in.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.229" offset="3280332">These plaintiffs are the only ones who do and it's proper in light of the presumption in favor of judicial review that standing be conferred on those who are adversely affected in fact and that is, of course the constitutional minimum but there is no question here that these parties or these petitioners are adversely affected in the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.142" offset="3367894">They’ve been -- some of them have been thrown off the land, they've been working all their lives and that we think compels the conclusion that standing is present.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.827" offset="3494640">As the term is not one of the broad general usage it is not as the government -- respondent suggests a synonym for current farming cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.101" offset="3535809">It had a long meaning confirmed by agricultural dictionaries that it refers to producing crops, it refers to harvesting, to sowing a seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.152" offset="3583979">It does not refer to the rental of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.625" offset="3593906">Now this interpretation we think is confirmed by the fact that within nine days after the Act was passed the Secretary of Agriculture issued regulations expressly forbidding any assignments for the purpose of paying rent for land.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.950" offset="3647195">This was immediately after the enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.075" offset="3659630">Now he was undoubtedly informed as to what Congress’ purpose had been, he saw the potential risk in permitting land owners to simply you surf the credit that would have been provided for tenant farmers by forcing them to assign and he said it could not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.682" offset="3734131">Now the same risk is present today and as we say respondent does not challenge the fact that the effect of permitting assignments to pay rent is to take the credit the Congress provided away from the tenant farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.491" offset="3797347">Now the question becomes what effect this has under the new Act, Section (d) 13 which as we say is the provision enacted in 1965 which incorporates by reference the prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.160" offset="3851995">Now that new Act is also pervaded with -- has several protections for small farmers in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.375" offset="3880835">Section (d) 10 of the act expressly authorizes and commands the Secretary to issue regulations to protect the interest of small tenant farmers and sharecroppers.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.786" offset="3922526">So, it can't be said that this purpose which underlay the 1937 Act has somehow that Congress is of the view that it's no longer important.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.846" offset="4374758">What the Secretary has done in our view is he has issued regulations in part protective of tenant farmers under (d) 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.430" offset="4409135">He has redefined the term “making a crop” in a way which prejudices severely tenant farmers for the benefit of landowners and does very little good for the rest of the farming population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.354" offset="4452812">Now the people who simply own land obviously do not have to assign for the purpose of paying rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.779" offset="4478516">The average rental value of cotton land is between one-third, at least in Alabama between one-third and one-half the value of the crop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.055" offset="4511640">So, even those farmers who do rent land are in no need of the right to assign for the purpose of paying rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.136" offset="4555943">What they can do is they can use the assignment to purchase the seeds, the tools, the other things that they need which are as large, in fact larger portion of the ultimate crop value and use whatever resources they are now expending to get those goods for the purpose of paying their rent if they are dealing with a landowner who will not -- who will simply refuse to accept a rent except on a pay now basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.445" offset="4673181">Now if that were -- if the Secretary’s purpose were to merely to help other farmers, he could have prevented the harm that is done here simply by issuing a regulation under Section (d) 10 which would say that even though assignments can be made for purpose of making cash rent, no landowner can kick a tenant -- can remove a tenant from the farm who refuses to make the assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.853" offset="4790836">Now if the only purpose which underlay to change definition of making a crop was to facilitate financing for farmers as a whole, this particular lawsuit could have been avoided by a protective regulation issue pursuant to Section (d) 10.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="1474.734" offset="6002291">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.342" offset="6016711">I'd like to start if I may with something in the nature of a counter statement of certain factual propositions that bear on this case and which I think put it in something of a perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.618" offset="6069896">First, although I think it was clear from petitioners’ oral presentation and perhaps it had been in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.054" offset="6099571">It should be clear that what we are talking about is a new program, the 1965 program and not a program which has been running since 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.602" offset="6141785">Petitioners have no right to make assignments to their cotton payments except under the 1965 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.245" offset="6164355">The right of assignment was new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.717" offset="6174281">They have never used it except under circumstances in which they were permitted to make assignments to pay for cash rent because the regulation that permitted them to make those assignments for that purpose was adopted prior to the first crop year, the crop year of 1966 to which the upland cotton program of 1965 applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.601" offset="6261739">They have not been able to make assignments at least since commodity payments seized under the 1938 Act and in the very early 1940's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.220" offset="6292250">Now they can do so and terms in which they can do so has not been materially changed since that program began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.932" offset="6323075">The second and really part of the first observation is that there has been no continuity in the administration of assignments provisions generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.445" offset="6357138">Section 8 (g) was passed in 1938 through 1941, literally hundreds of thousands of assignments were made every year and that year the war began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.993" offset="6403323">It was no longer necessary to make commodity payments in order to secure agricultural prosperity and Congress seized to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.498" offset="6437386">The assignment fell dramatically and by 1952 when statistics seized to be kept and when the Secretary of Agriculture went to the Congress and said “I don’t need this statute anymore, wipe it off the books.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.918" offset="6487019">By 1952 only 2,100 assignments were made under that Act in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.675" offset="6510111">So that there was an effect a 20-year hiatus between the end of practical importance for Section 8 (g) and the enactment of the 1965 Act which the Government’s position is the only Act in issue in this case and we think that has some substantial bearing on the issues before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.266" offset="6584404">The third thing and I think discuss to some extent Mr. Justice White to the questions you were asking is that there has been a radical shift in ten-year pattern even among those who rent the land they farm since 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.628" offset="6637902">Now we pointed out in a footnote to our brief, it's on page 32, footnote 22 that in 1935 42% of all farmers were tenants and they farmed 32% of this nations land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.238" offset="6704358">By 1964, their place had been taken by part owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.389" offset="6724942">Part owners are farmers who own some land and rent other land typically for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.859" offset="6750856">In the 1964, part owners outnumbered tenants and they farmed almost four times as much land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.819" offset="6778650">Now at the time that we wrote the brief, I had not been able to find statistics relating to cotton farming and footnotes note that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.789" offset="6814490">Since that time, I haven't able to find such statistics on a statewide basis and if the Court please, I should like briefly just to mention the ones which strike me as being significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.502" offset="6869347">They are from the census figures which are compiled on a statewide basis by the Department of Commerce and something called the United States Census of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.277" offset="6920443">In 1964, Census of agriculture for Alabama shows that 33% of the commercial farms in that state raising cotton were operated by part owners and these cotton farms, this 33% of Alabama's cotton farmers who have rent obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.249" offset="7000377">These cotton farms held 53% of the States cotton land, that's over half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.175" offset="7024097">On the other hand, cash tenants, the other major group, the only other major group with a cash rent obligation were only 11% of the States commercial cotton farmers and they farmed only 7% of its land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.537" offset="7093478">The figures I'm referring to are derived from numerical figures that appear on pages 64 and 65 of this volume and if the court pleases, I have Xerox copies of these pages which I've already given to counsel and which I will leave with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.329" offset="7168711">The point is there are over twice as many part owners as cash tenants in 1965 and they farmed over seven times as much cotton land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.471" offset="7205282">One could go on at considerable length but the point is a simple one, petitioners are not facing the changed interpretation of an established program under an old statute in which they have long participated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.847" offset="7250735">They are complaining of the initial interpretation of a new program which was passed and which applies and conditions very different from those which existed when the (Inaudible) bond statute on which it happens to draw was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.887" offset="7302875">The assignments statute was in 1965 was not a tenant statute and it's interpretation even as respect assignments to finance the farming cost of cash rent primarily effect others, part owners and not cash tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.560" offset="7365569">To get back to the other point of the questions you were asking Justice White regarding well, why has the Secretary done this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.172" offset="7408097">What about the protection of tenants, petitioners who were complaining in the course of their colloquy with you that he had adopted no regulations to provide for the protection of tenants?</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.452" offset="7449161">This was meant to apply to all farmers with cash rent obligations as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.057" offset="7471626">Of course there are regulations which were adopted for the upland cotton program and precisely in the same time and the same volume of the federal register on the same page, perhaps one or two pages before as the assignment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.873" offset="7526902">They are set out on page 46 of our brief and they provide the diversion and price support assignments or payments rather shall not be approved for payment by county committee if the county committee determines among other things that there exists between the landlord and any tenant or sharecropper any lease contract agreement or understanding unfairly exacted or required by the landlord which was entered into an anticipation of participating in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.252" offset="7648423">The effect of which is to force the tenant or sharecropper to pay over to the landlord any payment earned by him under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.558" offset="7677576">To change the status of any tenant or sharecropper so that to deprive him of any payment or right which he would have otherwise had had under the program to decrease the rent to be paid by the tenant -- to increase rather the payment to be paid by the tenant or to decrease the share of the crop or its proceeds to be received by the sharecropper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.173" offset="7752077">Now of course disagreements could exist, they are not present in the allegations with the legal contentions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.876" offset="7790843">Disagreements could exist as to whether those regulations are sufficient, whether they are properly enforced and obviously I don't believe that that's the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.431" offset="7833057">Petitioners do and I'm sure that there could be reasonable arguments about the question but what strikes me as being significant to this case is that the petitioners will have no part of those regulations and petitioners will have no part of the Section under which they were adopted 7 U.S.C. 1444 (d) 10 which does specifically provide that the Secretary of Agriculture must provide adequate safeguards to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.849" offset="7966804">They don't argue for standing under that provision for example, their argument isn't; well now here's a provision that says the Secretary must protect the tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.170" offset="8000031">Therefore, we have standing, that's not their argument nor do they argue that way on the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.205" offset="8024168">The Secretary has failed to protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.380" offset="8036916">Of course, it may be significant that that provision only requires adequate safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.317" offset="8068681">There is a little bit of legislative history which petitioners cite in part -- quote in part in their brief I believe it's at page 20 and 21 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.075" offset="8123643">Petitioners quote in part a House Report from the soil bank program at page 39 of that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.705" offset="8182157">They quote the sentence that said “no single problem connected with the proposed soil bank has caused the committee more concern than that of guaranteeing adequate protection of tenants and sharecroppers under the program.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.370" offset="8228864">The next following sentence in the report is as follows “several provisions referring to tenants and sharecroppers had intended to protect their interests while at the same time safeguarding the interests to landlords with scattered throughout the soil bank provisions of the Senate Bill and then several other sentences also in that report carry out the same theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.228" offset="8320293">Congress is not interested simply and only in the safeguarding the interest of tenants that they realize that landlords have interests too and therefore they provide for adequate protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.447" offset="8377135">The Secretary has a responsibility adequately to protect the interests of tenants and sharecroppers and --</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.038" offset="12947519">They say because the Secretary interpreted this obscure provision of the law in 1938 under another program which went out of practical existence in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.413" offset="12993076">In a particular way now we can't reinterpret that provision at all and we think that that proposition that Congress in 1965 despite legislative history which says absolutely nothing about the meaning of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.547" offset="13061517">About how it was applied, about whether it was meant to protect tenants or not that if this Court was to say that nonetheless it's reenactment of the statute in 1965 froze into law the prior administrative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.547" offset="13133511">That would be an extraordinarily harmful thing and this Court remarked does not particularly to our advantage as it was in the Leary case last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.866" offset="13178859">In connection with Leary, there was an argument, the Government made the argument that the interpretation of the Bureau of Narcotics which had existed for so long ought to be confirmed because there was legislative reenactment at a subsequent time and much less sweeping propositions and since it didn't in any way foreclose the possibility of future change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.360" offset="13272795">And this Court responded the scanty legislative history accompanying the reenactment gives no hint that Congress knew of this particular regulations much less the indirect impact now scribed to them.</text>
