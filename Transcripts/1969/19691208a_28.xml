            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 266, Sanks against the State of Georgia and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.276" offset="200495">Mr. Padnos.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Michael D. Padnos</label>
            <text syncTime="25.767" offset="206451">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.198" offset="224214">The issue presented in the Sanks case is quite different than the issue in the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.007" offset="247411">The issue presented to the Court today is whether the State of Georgia may constitutionally create a judicial procedure which by the terms of the statute discriminates against all tenants and in favor of all property owners in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.229" offset="312299">The issue is thus whether a state can divide all of its citizens into these two categories and discriminate in the manner presented in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.931" offset="359111">The operation of the statute has been extensively set out in the materials before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.804" offset="378546">I might also say that it has been considered before, thus this statute has been considered before in the case of Williams v. Shaffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.287" offset="408534">As the Court is aware, this is a statute under which landlords and big tenants by going to the marshal of the court taking out a bond which they want, which cost $6.00 and without any further proceeding or whatsoever, tenants are evicted from their premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.218" offset="468198">The only way a tenant can arrest these proceedings is by filing with the Court a counter-affidavit and with that, an amount of bond which the statute doesn't even stipulate to guarantee that the landlord will not lose either his money or double his money at the final determination of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.089" offset="547715">The question these statutes, these statutory provisions present first go to the heart of the notion of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.836" offset="578748">For the Georgia statute permits landlords to assert rights in a way that's completely different from the rights the tenants have.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.902" offset="606960">I think it's important to emphasize that this statute affects all landlords and all tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.480" offset="633292">And it doesn't matter whether they are individual or corporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.656" offset="641964">It doesn't matter whether the tenant has a valid claim or has no claim or whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.025" offset="659519">It doesn't matter whether the tenant is scrupulous and totally disrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.214" offset="676237">Everybody is affected by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.869" offset="702882">This Court has previously dealt with an issue which we feel is directly on point in the Sniadach case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.663" offset="730049">The Sniadach case which was a due process case like this one involved the taking of property of a person before there was any court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.577" offset="761710">And that's the crucial question: may a statute take away somebody's property without a court hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="170.915" offset="786996">In Sniadach, the Court held that it could not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.206" offset="800162">And in many ways, this case is even a better case than the Sniadach case.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.707" offset="818239">We feel we're completely within that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.774" offset="826493">The court need break no, no ground to decide in favor of the tenants in the Sanks case.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.332" offset="848750">We have a much narrower case than theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.675" offset="858049">For example as Mr. Justice Black pointed out in the Sniadach case, their, there was a question of whether the action taken -- that led to the case being brought in was a final disposition of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.806" offset="914578">In this case, there is no issue of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.331" offset="920743">It's very clear that once the tenant is out, that's a final disposition of that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.441" offset="941119">There was also a question in the Sniadach case that whether the matter involve was de minimis, that question was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.858" offset="962853">There's no question about this case being de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.573" offset="973615">Again, the tenant is out on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.359" offset="980825">That's the end of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.539" offset="993573">There was also a question in that case is whether the tenant had -- whether the parties to that case had demonstrated poverty and whether they were actually going to be affected by the operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.825" offset="1034637">Here, there's a specific judicial finding in the lower court opinion of indigency and that it was impossible for the tenants to obtain the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.518" offset="1065462">They will be affected by the statute indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.841" offset="1074761">They would be affected where the action of the court not held up by these proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.198" offset="1324178">He has to make a statement under oath that the tenant is either holding over or always -- I believe it's that he owes money to the landlord.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="312.725" offset="1354271">Holding over beyond the lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.931" offset="1359078">Holding over beyond the term of his lease hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.492" offset="1373288">And as Judge Williams pointed out in the lower court, the tenants in this case are tenants at will and indeed, that's a good illustration of the problem with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.860" offset="1406830">The tenants or tenants at will, therefore under the law, they're entitled to a 60-day notice to vacate and theoretically, the landlord can't do anything against them, can't take any action to evict them until he is given on the 60-day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.495" offset="1457403">But it doesn't work that way and what happens is the landlord can go in under any conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.862" offset="1478823">Now, as you point out Mr. Justice Stewart, it certainly would be possible for a tenant later on to bring an action for false eviction and indeed, Georgia Supreme Court makes the same suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.747" offset="1522395">But that doesn't do a tenant any good once he has been evicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.599" offset="1533785">Again, as you point out that the issue involved here is not money.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.763" offset="1546428">The issue involved is possession and that's what the statute's all about.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Michael D. Padnos</label>
            <text syncTime="370.370" offset="1584880">This statute was first enacted in 1827 and has been periodically modified since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.027" offset="1607450">But nothing in substance is really changed since 1827.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.777" offset="1622497">It's a curious and acronism.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.609" offset="1629811">They're just is in the statute in the country in which tenants are subjected to such a rigorous and immediate eviction and landlords are given such gracious privileges as the Georgia eviction statute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.631" offset="1685922">Indeed in thinking about asking other people to be submit amicus brief in the case, we couldn't think of going any place else because nobody else has a statute like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.386" offset="1728867">We're just unique in Georgia in having the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.133" offset="1755930">I think it's important when talking about due process in the Sniadach case to make it clear that we don't feel that Sniadach was an aberration in the court's thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.261" offset="1800443">Sniadach was in complete context with what the court's been doing for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.245" offset="1820400">Indeed in Hovy v. Eliot again, which was 70 years ago, the court there also took the position that not only notice was necessary in order for a due process, but also an opportunity to heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.395" offset="1884975">The usual requisites as Mr. Justice Harlan said in the Sniadach case, the usual requisites of due process are noticed in the prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.862" offset="1922800">Indeed, there are some wonderful languages in the Hovy case where the court really get quite upset about the procedure in that case which did not afford an opportunity for a hearing and said that a judgment issue done in those conditions wants all the attributes of the judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.175" offset="1992077">It is judicial user patient and oppression and can never be upheld where justice is justly administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.463" offset="2017259">This case we feel is quite like.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.489" offset="2025305">There has been notice but there is no opportunity to be heard unless the tenant presents a bond which in our case certainly, our tenants are never able to present to a court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alfred L. Evans, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="940.828" offset="3866728">Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.351" offset="3880730">While Mr. Padnos did not in his oral argument, deal with the poverty question, it is undoubtedly raised in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.560" offset="3913644">Therefore, I would like to say a few things right at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.973" offset="3927228">First of all, not every owner of rental property is a wealthy slum landlord nor is every owner of rental property, a public authority or governmental agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.132" offset="3975920">In Georgia, many and I dare to say most landlords are very ordinary people who themselves have to meet mortgage payments if they desire to continue to be owners of rental property.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.907" offset="4034957">Now, the relationship between the owner of the property and the man who has a possessory or use right is based upon contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.702" offset="4078216">In lease contracts as in contracts generally, the agreement is deemed to include all statutory provisions going to the subject matter of the contract unless the parties by stipulation of the agreement waived the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.622" offset="4145821">In Georgia, for over 140 years, a lease agreement has been deemed to include the agreement by the tenant that if he doesn't pay the rent or if he holds over or if he is a tenant at will or by sufferance, he has agreed that the landlord has the rights granted by Georgia's dispossessory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.517" offset="4245400">Appellant's constitutional contentions are based on equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.204" offset="4280195">I shall address myself first to equal protection and presently come to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.131" offset="4303914">Looking at equal protection, I might start out by observing that the mystique of the word's equality and equal protection are somewhat like the trinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.200" offset="4348217">It's much easier to accept by faith than to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.122" offset="4363891">Yet I think, if there is to be a meaningful discussion on equal protection or equality, we must determine what kind of equality we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.045" offset="4403597">There are as I see it two types, one is equality of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.759" offset="4426376">This is a sort of a numerical equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.937" offset="4439124">The other type of equality is equality of result which is a proportional equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.389" offset="4468903">The distinction is really quite important for the simple reason that the existence of one will invariably negate the presence of the other to illustrate, college tuition at a state university, there is equality treatment if there is a standard tuition charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.995" offset="4539329">That is equality of treatment.It is a numerical equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.468" offset="4553226">However, it is obviously of denial of equality if you use the approach of equality of result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.168" offset="4584051">To have equality of result, you would have to in effect deny equality of treatment by providing that one student must pay for something then another student does not have to pay for, obviously, denial, equality of protection -- excuse me, of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.448" offset="4653119">Now the first equality, equality of treatment is the traditional approach used by the legislatures and Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.369" offset="4684884">I've given the example of tuition at a state university.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.992" offset="4699303">Other examples would be sales and excise taxes, payment of gas, water, light and utility charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.524" offset="4729501">Bond posting requirements for public officials to enter into office assumed the duties of their office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.685" offset="4754160">All of these things are based upon equality of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.680" offset="4770043">There is no exception based upon the result to an individual, his financial means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.271" offset="4796479">This same approach has been traditionally used by this Court and I think all other Courts that the decisions which I have read in connection with fiscal requirements for narrow situations are narrow proceedings were involves access to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.563" offset="4873592">I'm emphasizing for a very narrow type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.932" offset="4887071">Cases of this Court would include of course Union Guano and Cohen versus Beneficial Loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.019" offset="4915493">In Cohen versus Beneficial Loan, the situation unlike the situation here involved the complete denial of access to the Court of the owner of stock if he didn't have a certain amount, and this Court held that there was no denial of equal protection there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2447.629" offset="9893909">Mr. Chief Justice, I just like to touch on several things Mr. Evans dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.428" offset="9909060">First of all, Mr. Justice Marshall has asked the question about the common law issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.232" offset="9928286">I'm afraid I don't think that's been too clearly presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.756" offset="9938422">In fact, the common law that the landlord did not have the right of common law just to evict the tenant who was overdue on his rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.272" offset="9968410">The payment of rent is a covenant, which required the landlord to go into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.252" offset="9984397">And the only way that the landlord could use self help is if the tenants he had come to an end, but that was not because the rent wasn't paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.528" offset="10013445">So, this is not an improvement on common law as the state has represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.760" offset="10030373">Indeed on the contrary, it's a much worst condition than common law.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2486.978" offset="10051271">Well if any eviction cases, the statute provided where summary remedy, let us say in the form of requirement to respond within 48 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.579" offset="10093693">You'd have almost the same kind of summary procedure that you got here, would you not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.231" offset="10116263">So you're not challenging the right of the state that you have the statute which calls for, permits the summary disposition of such a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.506" offset="10157432">No sir, bur we're talking about is our right to present defenses in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.839" offset="10178748">Indeed, one of the cases here really illustrates the badness of the statute of the Momman case which is one of the cases before the Court, which is one of the cases that we were not allowed to present the defense on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.360" offset="10232769">And in that case, what have happened was this is a tenant at the Atlanta Housing Authority and Mrs. Momman is a white woman and a number of people have objected to the fact that she was having black visitors to her house, and it was on that basis that the project manager decided to evict her and we were going to fight that in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.901" offset="10306957">Now that issue obviously is not for this Court and it's not for any Court because we wanted to bring it the Court and that's what brought Mrs. Momman into that Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.913" offset="11899068">And what is involved is just the issue of letting a Court make the determination of which right is superior.</text>
