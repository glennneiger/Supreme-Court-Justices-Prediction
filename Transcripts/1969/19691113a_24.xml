            <label>Mr. Leslie H. Levinson</label>
            <text syncTime="44.067" offset="279594">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.000" offset="295372">This case is on writ of certiorari to the Florida District Court of Appeal which affirmed a grand larceny conviction of the petitioner Joseph Waller, Jr. whom I represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.340" offset="344691">This Court ordered the case to be argued immediately after the case of Ashe versus Swenson which we have just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.150" offset="375933">Two issues of great importance in the administration of criminal justice in the states are presented by this case, and each issue in our view independently will provide grounds for reversing the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.143" offset="431940">One issue is a double jeopardy issue, that is to say whether the double jeopardy rule as applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated where there are successive municipal and state prosecutions of the same defendant arising out of the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.716" offset="518248">The second issue in this case, is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated where the trial judge imposes the sentence of imprisonment after reading a pre-sentence investigation report which he refuses to make available either to the defendant or to the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.679" offset="614066">The facts of the case are not in material dispute and never have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.111" offset="639770">On the City Hall of Saint Petersburg, Florida, there was a mural, a piece of canvas attached to the wall by glue or other adhesive.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.581" offset="685746">One day in 1966, in broad daylight and during business hours in the presence of a substantial crowd which include the police officers and other public officials, a group of people entered the City Hall, tore this mural off the wall, brought it downstairs into the street and starting walking through the streets of the city carrying this mural.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.934" offset="787101">The people engaged in this demonstration alleged that the mural portrayed the Negro race in an insulting caricature, and the people were expressing their displeasure by this form of demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.823" offset="846660">It is undisputed that the petitioner, Joseph Waller, Jr. was a member of the group, and that he personally participated in the removal of the mural from the wall and in carrying it through the streets of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.994" offset="911339">A very short while after and as part of the same continuous happening or course of conduct, the police confronted Waller and the other individuals, recovered the mural after a scuffle, by then the mural was in a slightly damaged condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.294" offset="980511">Perhaps the only conflict in the testimony of the case is just when the damage occurred, but at any rate, the mural was recovered by the police and Waller was immediately apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.396" offset="1036936">First, Waller was prosecuted in the City Court on the charge that he had violated two city ordinances during that course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.307" offset="1084583">One ordinance concerns destruction of city property, the other ordinance disorderly breech of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.666" offset="1118020">He plead not guilty to both charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.399" offset="1128991">A trial was held in the municipal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.438" offset="1141112">Waller was found guilty on both charges and was sentenced to the maximum of 90 days on each charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.059" offset="1175594">The sentence is to be served consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.392" offset="1192939">While he was serving, his total of 180 days on the city ordinance violations, an information was charged alleging the felony of grand larceny and this grand larceny prosecution is what turns out to be the subject matter of the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.858" offset="1274755">It is undisputed that the events alleged in the information for grand larceny concern the identical defendant, that is the present petitioner, and concern the identical course of conduct, the same day, the same time, the same mural and the same general series of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.795" offset="1354585">And this fact has been conceded by counsel for the State of Florida, is also established by an affidavit, executed by the petitioner and included in our appendix, page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.560" offset="1413622">The District Court of Appeal also found as an undisputed fact that the same defendant and the same course of conduct were involved both in the city and in the information for grand larceny filed by the State of Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.617" offset="1477883">I understand Mr. Levinson that there is no dispute about the fact that it's the same defendant, and that it was the same general course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.344" offset="1520724">I don't quite understand how it could be actually the same action that could be disorderly conduct and what was it, a malicious destruction of property or destruction of government property?</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="382.911" offset="1635035">Larceny generally, doesn't -- I mean, the typical congressional larceny case doesn't generally embrace what we think of is disorderly conduct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leslie_h_levinson" startTime="392.380" stopTime="507.955">
            <label>Mr. Leslie H. Levinson</label>
            <text syncTime="392.380" offset="1672861">Well Mr. Justice, in the felony trial in the Circuit Court, that's the trial for grand larceny, the point was raised by the defendant, that larceny generally consists under Florida law as elsewhere in the stealing of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.413" offset="1740988">However, the District Court of Appeal affirmed the Circuit Court on the theory amongst others that larceny in Florida may also consists of the destruction of the property rather than the stealing of it, or even creating an unreasonable risk of destruction under Florida law, sufficient to constitute larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.990" offset="1831372">The record contains a charge to the jury to that effect which we do not include in the appendix, but the Court may wish to refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.367" offset="1864808">And the opinion of the District Court of Appeal which is briefed in the appendix actually mentions the matter which was an issue on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.434" offset="1905142">And if I am refer to the Court, the Court to the opinion of the District Court of Appeal back on page 55 of our appendix, the District Court of Appeal coped with the problem, can there be a larceny by destruction under Florida law and they say yes, there can be, and there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.523" offset="1997511">To some extent, this represents a stretching of pre-existing Florida law on grand larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.110" offset="2027813">It illustrates perhaps that the state was straining pretty far in order to try to pin a grand larceny label upon what actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.039" offset="2071489">The District Court of Appeal did affirm the trial court upon the theory amongst others that larceny can exist on the basis of destruction of the property rather than clipping it and concealing it as we would normally think of larceny.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="507.955" offset="2135228">I was suggesting by my question that it was that it might be possible in a case, for example, let's assume there was a federal statute that makes it an offense to steal Government property and another statute that makes it an offense to destroy it, federal Government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.584" offset="2217671">I suppose it's conceivable that a person might steal portrait of George Washington from the White House and then a couple of weeks and be guilty of stealing it and then a couple of weeks later, in fear that he is going to be discovered, destroy it and that you wouldn't contend those were necessary one offense?</text>

            <text syncTime="551.730" offset="2310248">They would take place under your circumstances at different times for one thing, and they would offend different policies of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.698" offset="2342118">What I suggest here is that the -- a single incident happened continuously within the very few minutes was the sole evidence introduced both in the city court and in the Circuit Court, and the state strayed rather far in order to label it grand larceny presumably wanting to, if I may use that expression, “throw the book” at this defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.556" offset="2465625">I have to rely on the affidavit of the petitioner who was present and his affidavit which is not been controverted, states that the same facts were introduced an evidence in the city court as in the felony court.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.171" offset="2516093">That is the fact the he entered the City Hall, tore the mural off the wall, carried it out on the streets and it was recovered in a damaged condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.941" offset="2691114">We believe that the -- our rule of compulsory joinder would require that as many complaints of the state may have against the defendant by reason of this course of conduct, they should join them into one trial, try it once on the multiple count indictment if this proper, but not to keep on trying him a number of different times so that to use Mr. Clifford's term, he shall not have to run the gauntlets of the criminal process.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.447" offset="2917125">I believe that the state under the arguments which we have submitted in our brief and which I wish to elaborate on a little while, the state should join together all the charges in a single trial which may contain numerous counts alleging the various criminal statutes which has been violated.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leslie H. Levinson</label>
            <text syncTime="721.889" offset="2990895">This is certainly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.473" offset="2997269">We have an alternative theory, that is for theory of lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.230" offset="3020257">We believe that either the compulsory joinder or the lesser included offense theory will be sufficient to require reversal of the double jeopardy aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.731" offset="3070307">If I may resume, if it please the Court, after the felony information was filed alleging the crime of grand larceny, three more informations were filed by the county prosecutor alleging the three misdemeanors of one; unlawful assembly; two, malicious destruction of public property; and three, resisting arrest without violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.576" offset="3169677">Counsel was able to persuade the county prosecutor that double jeopardy had indeed been reached by the filing of these three misdemeanor charges and so the county prosecutor withdrew the three misdemeanors and they never came on for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.264" offset="3228400">But the state's attorney persisted in bringing these grand larceny charges at trial to trial and ultimately, the trial resulted in a judgment in the verdict against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.175" offset="3276048">Before the matter came on for trial, appropriate motions to quash were filed as the appropriate Florida means of challenging the double jeopardy aspect of a case, and when they were denied, a suggestion for a writ of prohibition was filed in the Florida Supreme Court as an additional means of attention -- to get the Florida courts to decide that double jeopardy had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.855" offset="3370820">These attempts were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.951" offset="3379179">The case came on for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.692" offset="3390151">The same evidence was introduced at this trial according to the petitioner's affidavit as had been introduced at the city court, the same mural was identified by the same witnesses as the record shows and eventually, the petitioner was found guilty and was given a sentence of from six months to five years which is the statutory maximum under Florida law for double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.570" offset="3497671">I might briefly mention the facts or the proceedings as they arose concerning the pre-sentence report and then I would like to return to a discussion of the double jeopardy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.184" offset="3540093">After verdict and before sentencing, petitioner moved the court for discovery of the pre-sentence investigation report which had been prepared by a probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.247" offset="3588368">Now, the court denied this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.330" offset="3596727">The call to refer to the pre-sentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.400" offset="3608952">The court pronounced the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.011" offset="4251460">We argued that for purposes of applying the Benton rule, a prior prosecution by a municipality within the state must be treated as equivalent to a prior prosecution by the state itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2359.815" offset="9542614">What seems to me that if that's the rule then what we wind up with is if you hold an audience, call an audience before you commit your crime, then that's the defense to the crime of larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.830" offset="9586709">I don't understand it that way and counsel tells us about compulsory joinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.553" offset="9605622">Who's compulsory joinder?</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.652" offset="9610010">I don't know what that is?</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.481" offset="9617324">There is no such creature, not in existence in Florida today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.828" offset="9638640">He may have asked for it, although the record doesn't' even reflect that he did that, but the point is how can we complain about they should have been brought in the same court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.811" offset="9682631">The point is, he didn't ask for it and they were not and structurally, Florida could have moved against him in one court for these three offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.688" offset="9722128">Now, the question of Benton -- we're told about Benton in doing this and that and the other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.339" offset="9748773">I don't pretend to tell you Mr. Justice Marshall what you meant in Benton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.261" offset="9764446">All I will tell you is that it gives a complaining citizen another reason to complain about jeopardy, that's all it does, very much the same as Matt did on search and seizure and Gideon did as to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.456" offset="9821184">Now Benton didn't change anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.245" offset="9832364">It simply says that here after, it will be a federally assured right under which people can complain when they think they've been placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense, not for the same course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.565" offset="9885654">Now, if you want to restructure the word offense to make it mean the same course of conduct, that's one thing, but if you are going to stick to offense that's what has to be done and it is simply not the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.970" offset="9935287">It is a series of acts, each one of which constituted a separate offense, two against one sovereign, one against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.544" offset="9965589">Since he doesn't complain about the 180-day sentence which was imposed on the city complaint, but only complains about the grand larceny charge which didn't include the other two then as far as I'm concerned, the question of double jeopardy does not come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.913" offset="10035075">The question of collateral estoppel doesn't become a collateral estoppel simply because we decide we're going to make it something other than the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.348" offset="10072795">Well in collateral estoppel you have to have an acquittal in order to have some adjudication of some question that's going to be involved in the other situation and that you certainly didn't have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.790" offset="10122533">So, I submit that collateral estoppel can't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.653" offset="10137997">I'll give you a good hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.078" offset="10143640">How about the man who kills two people in let's say in a span of four or five minutes in an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.568" offset="10173628">He pleads insanity when he's charged with the killing of the first one, and the jury acquits him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.874" offset="10202885">Then the state seeks to try him on the second one and he moves to prohibit them by saying well now look here, you acquitted me and it must have been obvious that you did so because you found me insane, and therefore, considering this my insanity of time, it's absurd to say that I could have been insane at this time, wasn't at the second one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.234" offset="10276342">But the question is suppose, suppose the jury have found him guilty, is it just possible that somebody would suggest that he's precluded from raising the defense of insanity on the second go around because the verdict of guilty precluded that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.483" offset="10349275">No, it does not and we don't have mutuality here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.486" offset="10365367">It weren't the same issues, it weren't the same sovereigns, it weren't the same victims, city the victim in the first; state the victim in the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.374" offset="10396818">Same defendant, admitted; covered a short span of time; admitted, but not the same facts, no mutuality, no collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.490" offset="10445302">The question of whether the pre-sentence investigation report should have been made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.954" offset="10467140">I don't know how much of a role that plays in this, I suspect probably not a great deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.708" offset="10486157">But you are to recall into the federal rules, federal district judges are free to make them available to counsel or not as it happens to suit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.440" offset="10521161">Now, I think that it's clear that if they decide not to give this information to defense counsel and so exercise their discretion, it is not reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.200" offset="10564211">I submit that in Florida, though some courts have been heard to do this, it is the rule in Florida that they are secret and they are not to be made available to counsel but only available to the court for such information as they may take from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.643" offset="10625964">If it isn't a violation of law for the federal courts not to make these available on the discretionary basis then how can it be for the state court not to give it to counsel in this instance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.041" offset="10679568">It is the same PSI report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.171" offset="10688031">It's very much the same as what we do in the confidential informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.289" offset="10700570">We don't allow the man to be bedeviled by people who want to challenge what the informants may say about him, the neighbors, the one thing and another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.202" offset="10744142">Counsel says to you we want to have the opportunity to check this to see if hearsay comes up, to see if inaccuracies are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.432" offset="10773086">The only way he can do that is to go to the people whose names appear in the PSI and tell them, “Look!</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.782" offset="10798477">Why did you say this, and you're wrong this that the other, you must come in and you must correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.049" offset="10819584">They'll harass him and you dry up the well spring, but beyond that, this doesn't go to the man's guilt or innocence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.047" offset="10851558">In Florida, the PSI has no function whatsoever unless and until a guilty verdict is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.459" offset="10877158">When it's found, there is an adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.052" offset="10887607">Then the judge orders a pre-sentence report and he uses this as a predicate for wherever sentence he imposes and if the sentence is one that's well within the limits prescribe by law and this one is, six months to five years, then the sentence in Florida is not reviewable, that is the law in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.632" offset="10961899">They will not review the sentence, if it's within the limits prescribed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.784" offset="10986559">This one was six months to five years, well within it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.463" offset="13293275">Mr. Chief Justice, just a word about this question of larceny by destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.875" offset="13314905">In order to establish the crime of larceny, the state has to prove amongst other things felonious intent, and as I understand Florida law, felonious intent can be proved either by an act of taking away to conceal the property or in Florida, felonious intent can be established either by the destruction or by exposing the property to an unreasonable risk of destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.403" offset="13416991">Since the taking took place in broad daylight in the presence of public officials and police officers, we contend there was no evidence before the jury which would justify a finding of felonious intent based on an attempt to conceal, that was impossible that in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.746" offset="13478327">And so, since jury found him guilty, the only possible basis of those finding of guilt must have been on the other branch of felonious intent, that is to say on the destruction or creating the reasonable risk of destruction of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.132" offset="13827950">Three years, but the mural was in the custody of the city even or not on the wall of the City Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.790" offset="13866506">Now, we believe it is possible for this Court to resolve the issue of the identity of the proofs without the necessity of remanding it to the Florida Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.595" offset="13913736">Obviously, if this Court find itself unable to resolve the issue it would be a proper one to send back to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.062" offset="13943620">Now, I would take the liberty of correcting the Attorney General in his comment that the State is unable to prosecute for the destruction of city property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.946" offset="13983117">Our appendix on pages 6 and 12 presents pertinent state statutes which do make it a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.558" offset="14009553">In fact, one of the three misdemeanors which was filed and then dropped, specifically referred to the destruction or damaging the city property, and this is set forth on pages 6 and 12 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.832" offset="14058663">In fact, the state has an ample arsenal of statutes that whatever conduct violates a city ordinance can pretty well be assured that having a counterpart in the state statutes, the state assumed a self resourceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.500" offset="14117386">Indeed, in finding statutes, there are the points of violating the Constitution and having the Vagrancy law reversed by a federal court recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.777" offset="14154480">And so, I believe that if we require the State to have a single trial of all their complaints against an individual the prosecutor can find in their discretion adequate statutory basis for bringing whatever trial will appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.437" offset="14229086">Mr. Georgieff states that we will be quite prepared to have our petitioner tried and sentenced for all of his offenses in one trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.146" offset="14267956">This is not quite so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.675" offset="14274121">We certainly want only one trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.747" offset="14282376">In that trial, the State could bring whatever complaints it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.617" offset="14301811">We might then argue that that they would be unnecessarily overlapping between the complaints under rule of (Inaudible) case which holds that a legislation will be presumed to intend multiple punishments arising at a single act unless the language of the statute clearly states that multiple punishments are called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.508" offset="14385403">Just to summarize the double jeopardy argument, and I can hope I can spent it at one minute on the important issue of pre-sentence reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.617" offset="14409853">We believe there are two basis, either one of which will support our argument on the double jeopardy claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.323" offset="14432632">One is compulsory joinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.669" offset="14442036">We assert as a rule of constitutional dimensions that the state should have only one trial of a defendant on the basis of a single act or course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.100" offset="14491773">There maybe exceptions to this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.685" offset="14498147">For example if the victim of an assault dies after trial, we could say will this would give rise to an exception to the compulsory joinder rule or if the first trial was a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.368" offset="14544854">But in all that you clarify the law of double jeopardy and also included within it the common law tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.875" offset="14574843">We submit that compulsory joinder should be the presumption and to then the exception needs to be justified by the state.</text>
