            <text syncTime="125.812" offset="606647">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.214" offset="624201">I’ll be rather brief in as much as this re-argument and some of the factual arguments have been made by prior counsel today.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.180" offset="664116">I would like to briefly, if I may, go over the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.588" offset="685746">We had a situation in this case, where there was a robbery, four individuals robbed a particular residence and then took some money, canvas and some other personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.253" offset="756381">The day after the robbery which was June 4th, the robbery date being June 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.292" offset="776547">On June 5th, two of the four accomplices to this particular robbery were captured in a narcotics situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.966" offset="819284">And they were captured in the car of the petitioner Archie Hill, along with other personal property that was recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.819" offset="854601">The two particular individuals that were captured told the officers that Archie Hill was one of the four participants in this robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.609" offset="901831">They implicated him to this particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.158" offset="920012">The police then checked out the association, the petitioner Archie Hill with the other two participants in the police records that they had available.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.362" offset="964838">They got the description of Archie Hill which was approximately 5’10”, 160 Lbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.938" offset="991169">They got the address and so forth. On the 6th of June, they proceeded to the residence of Archie Hill, the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.314" offset="1032652">At that time, the petitioner was not in his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.789" offset="1054490">We’re talking about a four room apartment, one bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.349" offset="1068805">There was a Mr. Miller in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.806" offset="1082598">The officers came in to the apartment and upon noticing Mr. Miller, made an immediate arrest, thereafter shoving Miller aside, searching the other rooms and finding nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.572" offset="1137664">At that time Mr. Miller indicated that he was Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.869" offset="1154800">He showed the officers identification showing that he was Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.824" offset="1178624">He further indicated that he was waiting for Mr. Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.898" offset="1206941">The officers in this case did not ask permission to search the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.631" offset="1225853">Thereafter, they spent approximately two hours, making an extensive search of the particular apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.372" offset="1260857">Now, the primary purpose of the search was to recover the personal property, additional personal property and the weapons which included two knives and two guns in the apartment house.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.543" offset="1437550">Yes, Mr. Miller who in fact was Mr. Miller was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.346" offset="1456776">He stated that he was Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.816" offset="1466598">The police said that the identification meant nothing to them that he flipped the description of Mr. Hill exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.485" offset="1505364">And therefore, they felt that because criminals tend to in many instances, to avoid arrest, they will falsify their identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.528" offset="1549458">So in this situation, Mr. Miller was in fact Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.462" offset="1565236">Mr. Hill was not in the apartment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.323" offset="1580701">Now, the search was very extensive.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.887" offset="1598882">And what they recovered which is extremely damaging to the petitioner in this action was a personal diary in a drawer, in the dresser.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.377" offset="1640887">And the reason why this particular evidence is extremely damaging even though they found other evidence associated with the crime, is because Bader who was one of the four accomplices lived with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.796" offset="1690520">And he stated that he was involved in the particular crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.826" offset="1726673">Is there any question, is there any contention in this case that the police in arresting Miller turned out to be not Mr. Hill, were acting in bad faith when they arrested him in thinking he was Mr. Hill?</text>

            <text syncTime="423.392" offset="1796890">Well, Your Honor, I think the Court of Appeal that reversed this, indicated that police were acting in good faith when they did reverse the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.858" offset="1926771">They took two days after this trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.355" offset="1956760">And in the trial record, the Court indicated that the officers were acting in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.447" offset="1981210">However, the Court further indicated that he realized that he may be opening Pandora’s box that Rabinowitz and Harris was never intended to go this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.690" offset="2034082">Now, certainly we contend strongly right from the outset that Rabinowitz and Harris are not applicable to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.843" offset="2082774">Certainly, counsel in the prior cases have already indicated this, insofar as the factual details of Rabinowitz and Harris.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.103" offset="2407737">And clearly the facts that I’ve stated here, do not indicate any type of kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.411" offset="2429053">Fortunately, the Superior Court in San Francisco County has reversed that to habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.809" offset="2454653">And this leaves, I think possibly to another matter here where we are talking about the second degree robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.679" offset="2530095">The Rabinowitz case and the Harris case, I think when you review those cases very carefully, it’s interesting to know that they infer throughout the decision itself that it should apply to those particular facts in Rabinowitz and Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.621" offset="2621837">But unfortunately, this Court did not see fit to expressly state that.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.403" offset="2645034">And as a result, the states across this country have just murdered this decision, giving it unrealistic results as far as this particular petitioner’s contentions concerned are.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.755" offset="2694353">Certainly, the factual situations when you put Rabinowitz and Harris together come up with a situation where really you could almost fit, nearly every factual situation to a situation where you do not need a search warrant and if you get the search warrant, you’re better off without it because you can go further like in this particular case, they never could have got any search warrant for that diary and yet because they have gone beyond the scope, they’re able to bring in this extremely damaging evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.957" offset="3543228">I think in conclusion here at this time, I would just like to indicate to the Court that this case right from the outset was attacked on the Rabinowitz and Harris theory that really Chimel was not a criteria so far as taking this case up and that during the whole procedure up, it was a very difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.338" offset="3644688">And I think that the reason it was difficult was because of the expanded critical decisions of Rabinowitz and Harris as we have gone along in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.902" offset="3690977">And the Trial Court, when they indicated, they are open at Pandora’s door was not as the Attorney General indicates in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.134" offset="3727862">Opening a situation where if every case, there is a person who is not in that particular apartment, then all of a sudden, you have opened the door in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.572" offset="3769657">What they are talking about really was Rabinowitz and Harris gave the Government wide latitudes in the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.443" offset="3801109">Now, we are going to a situation where the person doesn’t even have to be there, then all of a sudden, you come to a situation where really there just isn’t going to be any exceptions to amount to a material reason why they cannot search once they have the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.508" offset="3897448">And I’m arguing particularly in this case because of the situation where the equities should come out where here, an individual has served in his fifth year on a minimum one year has never been up for parole because he was convicted of a kidnapping charge that he clearly did not do at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.618" offset="4253863">And beside from the issue of the retroactivity of the Chimel decision there are two or three issues involving the legality of the search under pre-Chimel law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.688" offset="4310079">Before reaching these issues however I’d like to quickly dispose off the new element that petitioner has injected into the case, namely this collateral proceeding in the California Courts whereby I believe within a month previously, the kidnapping count was set aside but that was on a state law ground and that is not even a final judgment that is being appealed to the Court of Appeal --</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.287" offset="4480502">The kidnapping count is gone but the robbery counts which carry a maximum of life imprisonment remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.184" offset="4508087">In fact, although petitioner’s minimum is one year since that time not applicable to him, the statute provides for a 15 year minimum whereas here, there is a bodily injury to the victim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.319" offset="4636609">On Saturday, June 4th, 1966, a robbery is committed, involving a brutal assault and unnecessary assault by gang of fur armed men.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.310" offset="4732635">And petitioner at page 10 of his opening brief really concedes that there is probable cause to arrest him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.627" offset="5197928">Now, what the police do is they knocked and they identified themselves and they’re confronted by a man who opens the door and who looks exactly like petitioner Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.659" offset="5254040">And they have descriptions of petitioner Hill from the victims of which there were three.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.542" offset="5289566">But they have general descriptions and they have of course a description from petitioner’s roommate and they have their own information from their files involving previous arrest of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.333" offset="5332720">So they go there and there is a man who the record Bader indicates is only 10 Lbs off in weight and 2 inches in height.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.986" offset="5547342">Now, what happens is before the officers even enter the apartment, they see a gun with a loaded clip in plain view from the threshold to the apartment sitting on the coffee table.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.769" offset="5618500">They asked this man, what do you know about guns being on the premises?</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.821" offset="5642637">He says “I don’t know about guns being on the premises.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.390" offset="5652982">Well what about this one?</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.598" offset="5657788">You know, this already certainly alerts them as to evasive conduct by the person they suspect being the member of the robbery gang.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.119" offset="5699897">So, he is also unable to give any satisfactory explanation for this presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.497" offset="5725393">He is asked how did he get in here, “Well, I don’t know, I just got in here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.545" offset="5737514">Where is petitioner Hill?</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.407" offset="5756949">So, then he says “I’m Miller and I’ve got identification to prove it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.341" offset="5776697">But are the officers supposed to believe that when he tells them he doesn’t know anything without a gun in plain sight?</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.855" offset="5802820">So they are entitled -- as Justice Black stated in a previous argument today to assume that the person who opens the door especially when he matches the tenant’s description is the person in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.683" offset="5866141">Now, this is where the divergence begins in the treatment of the case between the Court of Appeal and the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.359" offset="5904802">The Court of Appeal adopted the approach suggested by petitioner that somehow what is important in ascertaining the legality of a search is not the dominion and control of the person over the premises, in a physical sense but at somehow his proprietary control that matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.841" offset="5990693">Well, this is a concept that I believe this Court has rejected time and time again in the Jones case, Silverman case and I think finally buried in the Katz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.900" offset="6038967">That the right to search incident to arrest, whatever its scope does not depend upon proprietary matters but rather upon the physical dominion and control because after all, it’s for the officer’s protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.057" offset="6099571">And I think that Katz indicates that clearly, we’re concerned with the ability of the person to grab a weapon, all of these cases indicate this is the consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.546" offset="6397576">The risk that the public will have access to the person’s words or his property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.796" offset="6478555">There is a certain assumption of the risk by having visitors in your apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.118" offset="6495796">If you invite the visitor in, let’s say Hill had been there and they had come to arrest Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.146" offset="6519933">It was Hill’s place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.435" offset="6525158">I don’t think that the fact that Miller had no proprietary control over the premises, it would mean that the officers would have to say “we’re not going to search here because we’re invading Hill’s privacy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.811" offset="6570611">I think that Miller could’ve grabbed a weapon of a drawer next to him even under the Chimel scope and injured the officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.984" offset="6763290">Now, I think what’s important here is that if you assume that Hill was there, the search that took place was totally proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.265" offset="6820446">It was a type of search that would have been permissible under pre-Chimel law and the fact that this mistake occurred in good faith should make no difference and the treatment of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.847" offset="6862764">Otherwise, certainly any felon could frustrate any search by claiming to be somebody other than the petitioner and unless the officer had personally seen them, that would just automatically preclude further search.</text>

            <text syncTime="2464.533" offset="9961514">They would have had to wait well over 12 hours to obtain a search warrant and perhaps more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.339" offset="9980740">It occurred to me that the first Tuesday in California at least is a Court holiday in the month of June in election year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.219" offset="10020237">So, this really might be a 36 hour wait, instead of a 12 hour wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.153" offset="10043956">Now, was there any reason why they shouldn’t wait this day or two?</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.234" offset="10060257">Well, the officers knew that there was a fourth member of the robbery gang at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.600" offset="10081782">This gang was armed and dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.006" offset="10091395">They had committed several other robberies in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.632" offset="10101948">The officers knew that the weapons and the stolen property were at petitioner’s apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.554" offset="10121592">Thus time was of the essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.700" offset="10130160">The officers were confronted with what was very close to a hot pursuit situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.745" offset="10154402">And there were these reasons for not delaying the search until the search warrant could be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.376" offset="10176867">Petitioner and the fourth member of the gang, (Inaudible) were at large and they could still be committing other assaults and robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.967" offset="10211244">Secondly, the arrest of two members of the gang, just two-and-a-half hours before the search here, might alert petitioner to flee from his apartment and perhaps from the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.873" offset="10262862">And thirdly, if petitioner were arrested that evening and then search of the apartment delayed another day or two, that fourth man back -- might have come back being alerted by petitioner’s arrest or the arrest of the two other man Bader and Baum and realized that the officers would have seen incriminating evidence when they arrested petitioner and then might have removed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald M. George</label>
            <text syncTime="2617.419" offset="10573093">I think it’s significant that the officers knew that both guns in the robbery and all of the remaining stolen property were on these premises and that these were armed and dangerous men and they had to act quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.551" offset="10625546">Now, I won’t go into it in detail but the problem of exigent circumstances is graphically demonstrated in the amicus curiae brief filed by the Americans for effective law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.223" offset="10684270">They demonstrate the practical necessities for having a meaningful exigent circumstances exception to the Chimel rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.237" offset="10724289">The brief that that organization has filed, details a couple of presently pending cases where the murder weapon itself was disposed off, during the time that the officers sought to comply with Chimel and went out to try and get the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.949" offset="10807150">Now, one related problem of course is what can be done to secure the premises and that’s one of the most serious problems and in California, our view is that the premises cannot be secured to the extent that people who are not involved in criminal conduct are restrained, their movements are followed around the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.516" offset="10905475">Perhaps a matron has to come because the wife of the petitioner is there, she wants to use the facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.164" offset="10932015">She could dispose off evidence, you have to have an armada men and equipment there to follow everybody around the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.981" offset="10959287">So I think that there is a serious problem about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.292" offset="10968586">And that is what has been most difficult to leave with, under the Chimel decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.658" offset="10990007">Now as far as retroactivity is concerned, we detailed our views in the brief and I think it’s important of course to apply a fully prospective test to the Chimel decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.939" offset="11059179">The purpose of the decision of course is to deter unlawful police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.567" offset="11077674">That’s not going to be deterred by punishing police officers for what they did relying on the existing law as decided by this Court several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.254" offset="11120410">And up to two or three years ago, specifically at the time this search was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.698" offset="11142144">There certainly has been reliance and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of this Chimel decision would be I submit greater than the effect of any decision of this Court on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.669" offset="11198046">Just thousands of prisoners would be sent back for new trials and only questionably could be retried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.644" offset="11237961">And I’d like to launch with the Court an original and ten copies of a memorandum which I have provided petitioner here, a manhour cost study regarding the Chimel decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.260" offset="11292400">And that report is very significant in indicating that annually, the Chimel decision will cost the Los Angeles Police Department alone an additional 86,000 manhours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.791" offset="11370559">And the monetary cost is close to half-a-million dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.843" offset="11522696">And this is just the cost to police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.486" offset="11541295">Not clerical, personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.081" offset="11555715">Now, this I believe averages out to about 30 extra police officers for the City of Los Angeles a year because of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.531" offset="11585494">And consequently, one can imagine the retroactive application of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.806" offset="11634604">And what I would like to note in conclusion as far as the impact of this decision is that, this strikes at the most sensitive nature of police work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.464" offset="11681207">The type of property crime, burglaries particularly where the rate of recovery is lowest it might be of interest to Your Honors to note that less than 10% of stolen property is recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.207" offset="11736168">Now, when the time that takes to obtain a search warrant and each case which is several hours is multiplied by the hundreds of situations, every day that occurred necessitating one under the Chimel decision, one can see the impact of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.281" offset="11804505">One can easily point to one case or at the other case and say a warrant could have been obtained here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.875" offset="11822895">But if one looks at the overall impact, it’s quite apparent with two million burglaries being committed annually in this country, 265,000 of them in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.901" offset="11870960">That there is indeed a real problem of just not getting slowed under by police work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.687" offset="11898128">So for these reasons, we would submit very strongly that the date of prospectivity should be adopted that all searches conducted previous to the date of Chimel, not be governed by the rule of that decision and we urge that the search and seizure in this case is lawful in all respects.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.154" offset="12363943">I think, the words in the transcript are and I quote “that he could go to petitioner’s apartment.” And I think that’s a far cry from giving consent to search into drawers in the bedroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.519" offset="12501452">And if he doesn’t say you can search my drawers, or search my places, I would indicate and go to the apartment and meet Mr. Hill at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.922" offset="12579088">I would still say Your Honor the same thing applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.167" offset="12588074">I think, on two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.077" offset="12599672">One is, he wasn’t given expressed permission to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.865" offset="12618794">And secondly, there is another serious questions to whether another person can give up the constitutional privacy, another part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.013" offset="12675427">Now, insofar as the amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Attorney General of Colorado and the police chiefs across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.318" offset="12708655">I too believe that this is a good case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.701" offset="12718164">That guidelines could be set as to what the police can and cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.159" offset="12736031">But it still doesn’t take even those examples really go back to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.886" offset="12770931">The examples there are pretty extreme and yet that the Attorney General points out in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.906" offset="12799039">And yet in all those cases that he points out, those extreme examples where certainly there is a necessity for guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.559" offset="12829654">The Attorney General was able to get convictions in all of those matters expressed even though they had to go and get the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.757" offset="12866435">In this case, I think it isn’t that close of an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.034" offset="12891512">Now insofar as retroactivity and counsel has indicated that 30 officers in Los Angeles will be required if it is made retroactive, the Chimel decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.224" offset="12992240">That’s correct Your Honor, that’s what I was alluding to, improperly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.453" offset="13009168">The point that I would like to make is that we draw some happy median and drop it from maybe 30 officers to one officer on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.241" offset="13044381">Those cases certainly outnumber, at least on a 30:1 basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.979" offset="13091297">You can’t un-ring a bell, you can’t -- if this was an unconstitutional search, there’s no way to constitutionalize it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.458" offset="13125256">You can’t go back and get a search warrant and go on --</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Amato</label>
            <text syncTime="3258.093" offset="13135705">Then I ask, what is the purpose of the 30 officers?</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.975" offset="13151274">What difference does that basically make?</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.856" offset="13162768">In other words, the inference that I got and although I didn’t quite understand it, if you need 30 officers, on something that’s already passed, you don’t need any officers, what differences does it make?</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.453" offset="13205191">I thought the point he was trying to bring out was the fact that if you make it completely retroactive, you’re going to have to accumulate a lot of this evidence based on past cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.549" offset="13249599">And now, I’m saying that if you have to get additional man power, that if you make it only on direct appeals, certainly a 30:1 ratio isn't unreasonable in light of all the years that are involved prior to Chimel versus the cases on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.449" offset="13325145">I like to conclude with this last point that I wasn’t going to mention until counsel mentioned about the numbers of crime and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.578" offset="13361716">I don’t stand up here for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.658" offset="13369971">I hope no attorney or citizen does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.237" offset="13388361">Certainly, numbers can be misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.346" offset="13400795">And I think earlier in this case, I pointed that out where the gravity of this plan was elevated to kidnapping where in fact Harold Chessman died under the same penal code section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.743" offset="13458369">And this Court knows the facts of this case and certainly he was subjected to the death penalty also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.081" offset="13483656">And yet, there would have been totally unreasonable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.545" offset="13501524">Just as we indicated, it’s been totally unreasonable to go into the bedroom and to get that diary and there’s no indication that this particular diary wasn’t a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.100" offset="13547813">The only evidence and if it wasn’t a book, it should have been brought out by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.819" offset="13566621">The only evidence is that there was two pages of a diary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.556" offset="13585638">No weapons could have been or supposedly no weapons could have been within those two pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.771" offset="13610506">There is no evidence to indicate that it was anything different from the ordinary two sheets of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.869" offset="13630882">I would submit strongly Your Honor, in the interest really of justice in this particular case that this case -- that this Court reverse the Supreme Court and affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
