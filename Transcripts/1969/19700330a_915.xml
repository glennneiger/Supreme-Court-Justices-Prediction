            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="112.272" offset="552417">The Court already has some familiarity with these matters in the Penn-Central Merger case, the inclusion report of the Commission, which I will have occasionally, refer to was before the Court at the time it decided the Penn-Central Merger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.617" offset="633814">The New Haven filed a petition for reorganization in the Connecticut District Court in 1961 and that reorganization has continued since.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.381" offset="688880">Judge Robert Anderson was in charge of the reorganization from the beginning and continued to be after his appointment to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.475" offset="729318">It was -- and is a somewhat unusual type of reorganization from the very beginning because the Railroad had been running deficit since at least 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.788" offset="778533">It was apparent that the only way to keep the Railroad running was to have some kind of a merger or sale to another railroad in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.163" offset="828061">And during the time of reorganization, that is from 1961 down through the 1968 at which time the Penn Central took over the New Haven and paid over the considerations subject to review of the problem of price.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.865" offset="906846">The reorganization had accumulated some $65 million of charges and claims ahead of the bonds as a result of reorganization expenses and borrowings and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.368" offset="964838">This process continued, I think there is no dispute because of the determination on the part of a judge and the trustees and the trustees’ counsel and the Commission to keep the Railroad running and a proper feeling on the part of Judge Anderson and the others that New England required the continuation of this Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.826" offset="1066715">I think Your Honors are familiar enough with its physical circumstances, so that help me to go into those that runs from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York and these both are a railroad which takes commuter traffic and interstate traffic of a more general in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.687" offset="1146128">It's clear I think that from the very beginning, the trustees were seeking to find a railroad with which there might be a merger of the New Haven or an acquisition of the New Haven and that from the very beginning while this search went on, there was no prospect that the road could have been abandoned or liquidated because of the concern of everyone to keep it running.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.629" offset="1273919">In 1961, the trustees approached the Pennsylvania and the New York Central on behalf of New Haven to see if they were interested in some acquisition and in 1962, they reported that the only salvation for this Railroad was some kind of a merger or acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.743" offset="1362317">And in the same month, March 1962, the Pennsylvania and the Central asked approval of their merger under Section 52 of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.058" offset="1399620">In June 1962, the trustees intervened in the merger case to seek inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.350" offset="1428773">There were negotiations in 1964 between Penn Central and the trustees which were unknown to the bondholders and which ultimately resulted in an agreement which was disposed for the first time in a report of a Commission Examiner, an agreement under which the merged corporation would acquire the New Haven assets for certain specified considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.555" offset="1553638">The Commission approved the merger and required Penn Central to include both passenger and freight operations and said in its order, “All upon such fair and equitable term as the parties may agree subject to the approval of a Bankruptcy Court and the Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="380.849" offset="1626781">In October 1966, the trustees and Penn Central filed their agreed purchase agreement as a first step in the plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.020" offset="1671502">Hearings before an Examiner followed, report was dispensed with and the matter was submitted directly to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.362" offset="1704835">For some intermediate proceedings and in which arrangements were made for loans to the New Haven and other matters, but I don’t see if they’re relevant to what we are concerned with here and the were cited in the brief and I won’t take time to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.688" offset="1766170">There followed the inclusion report of November 1967, which is the report which was before this Court at the time of the Penn-Central Merger, at least this Court knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.602" offset="1817788">That report led to the first round of these appellants’ successful applications to the courts below, and both courts below remanded to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.101" offset="1875780">The essence of that inclusion report as far as the New Haven is concerned is that using evaluation as the evaluation date, December 31, 1966, the Commission found net liquidation value of the New Haven assets was a $128.9 million, which had rounded to a $125 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.207" offset="1976195">It found the fair value of the consideration to be paid by the Penn Central under the purchase agreement was a $123.6 million which had rounded to a $125 million so that the consideration and the value of the liquidation value were similar and because of that, equality which it saw in the transaction had held that the transaction met statutory standards and approved it by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.191" offset="2112136">The present appellants petitioned for review and the three-judge court was convened consisting of Judge Friendly and Judge Levet, and Judge Weinfeld from the southern district.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.706" offset="2166157">By order of May 1968, the court disapproved the inclusion report on the ground that it appeared that the Penn Central should pay an additional sum of $45 to $50 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.895" offset="2234911">I don't think there's any use in going into the items there, they are set forth in our brief on page 15 from Judge Winfield's later dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.604" offset="2269811">While the matter was pending before the three-judge court, the Commission submitted the purchase agreement to the reorganization court as step one in the plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.285" offset="2328534">In April 1968, the court appointed a former judge of the Court of Appeals in New York Judge John Van Voorhis has a special master that considered the problems that are arising out of the Grand Central Terminal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.126" offset="2391855">We don't say a word about that although Mr. Migdal is going to carry the argument on the point on the matter that it’s still open.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.978" offset="2427277">Just after the turn of the century, the railroads using Grand Central Terminal came down a great open ditch, which is now Park Avenue and that seemed to kind of a waste of a valuable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.842" offset="2486732">And in the early part of the century it was bridged over to create Park Avenue, and as a result of that and the agreements between the Central and the New Haven, a number of the principal hotels at which we have all to few left were built the Waldorf, the Biltmore, the Commodore, the Roosevelt, the Pan-Am building is older than the Yale Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.433" offset="2589132">The New Haven and Penn Central -- the Central had a sort of a partnership interest in these properties and there was dispute about the nature of that interest and its value.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.501" offset="2653393">The Commission in its inclusion report stuck a balance between various possibilities and arrive at a figure of $13 million as the figure that should be allowed, but that was evidently too low and Judge Van Voorhis was asked to report his views about the legal relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.093" offset="2731760">And he upheld the view that there was a partnership interest in connection with the Grand Central properties and ultimately as I will show Your Honors in the remand report the original loss of $13 million was advanced to $28 million so that under the present position of the Commission, the New Haven is entitled to $28 million for its interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.086" offset="2847744">There is no dispute that the value of the property is $227 million so that the Penn Central has acquired a very valuable property for a very small amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="726.716" offset="3010226">The reorganization court like the three-judge court concluded that the allowance by the Commission was inadequate that the undervalued property and he too remanded to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.054" offset="3083577">The three-judge court thought that the amount the Commission should increase its determination value was $45-50 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.509" offset="3121403">Judge Van Voorhis spread was a little wider.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.778" offset="3130493">He thought it should be $33-55 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.200" offset="3148152">Judge Anderson, I beg your pardon, Judge Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.580" offset="3165706">The Commission proceeded the whole expedited hearings and made its remand report on November 25, 1968 and this is the one which these appellants attacked here, and so I will be talking about some phases of that a little later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.945" offset="3263195">The Commission was sustained on some matters by the courts later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.937" offset="3295169">I don't think I need to take any time on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.718" offset="3302275">So what we are going to talk about on our side are those things where the Commission was sustained by division among the judges and those things where the Commission was not sustained -- or was sustained but we think the court was wrong in sustaining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.413" offset="3376985">The effect of the decision on remand was starting with the liquidation value of a $125 million, which the court had found for a $128 million -- 128.9, which the Commission had found on its origin inclusion order and increasing that to a $162.7 million and then immediately retreated by a series of deductions, major deductions from that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.008" offset="3519404">The most significant and those to which I am going to address myself being to totaling $22 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.564" offset="3553677">One is so called discount for a abandonment delay and the other discount for -- so called discount for bulk sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.386" offset="3596936">And in both this cases, our position is that Judge Anderson and Judge Winfield who dissented below were correct in their view that this discounts were unjustified and that Judge Friendly and Judge Levet were wrong in concluding that they could be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.972" offset="3691290">And so we shall ask Your Honors to follow the reorganization court on these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.382" offset="3712920">Our order to about what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.034" offset="3727548">The first discount, the abandonment delay discount or as in the substantial figure of $15,386,000.00 and this was based upon the theory that beginning in 1967, the New Haven would have had to start abandonment proceeding that that would have taken a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.547" offset="3845517">That in that year, the New Haven would have had been practically as it stand still and although the losses for that year were already charged against the New Haven that the Commission could properly charge it again for up to an additional sum of $15, 386,000.00 and the bulk sale discount was a discount of about $6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.670" offset="3970069">The Commission held that it could require that the New Haven's properties be sold in bulk at a discount because it had the power to condition the abandonment certificate on a sale in bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.973" offset="4043316">This abandonment certificate which have had thought would have to be sought, which was never sought and never could have been obtained could be condition on this bulk sale discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.900" offset="4086993">And that was the theory on which the Commission went.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.776" offset="4106428">They made a few adjustments upward in their remand report, including an addition of sum on the Grand Central Terminal, which I have already referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.540" offset="4145507">But the net result of their whole operation of finding liquidation value of a $132 million and then making this large deductions was to arrive at a figure of $140.6 million to which it added $5 million additional arriving at a total figure of $145.6 million and then it proceeded to find that the consideration for that, which was largely in stock was worth that amount and therefore it would approve the acquisition at that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.354" offset="4280822">Now taking the figure of that the Commission arrived at that I've just mentioned just so you have a kind of a guide to what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.131" offset="4323871">Taking the price of Penn Central stock, it brought in the consideration in December 1968 which is the date of the Commission’s remand report, the first mortgage bondholders would have received 24 cents on the capital on a dollar, 18 cents on a dollar if interest is included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.379" offset="4428884">You will see at once of course that the expectations of the reviewing courts, the three-judge court that $45-50 million would be added and the reorganization court that $33-55 million would be added as a result of the reconsideration fell far short of achievement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.812" offset="4518640">Judge Anderson when the prompt of the remand report came before him approved the immediate transfer of the property, two of the New Haven, two of the Penn Central so that the property would be required before the end of the year having previously ruled that unless there was transaction before the end of the year, the New Haven trans would stop running on January 1, 1969 because the erosion would then gone beyond any possible constitutional limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.201" offset="4660224">And so the transfer took place and from that time on -- remember this was before Your Honors, there was an effort to stop the transfer and the courts below denied a stay and so the transfer proceeded leaving the question of price opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.526" offset="4725426">Now the state of the conflict between the courts below is that as to this abandonment delay discount, Judge Anderson and Judge Winfield thought it was entirely unjustified that it was illegal and erroneous and was not sustained by substantial evidence, Judge Friendly and Judge Levet and the three-judge court affirmed, submitted on the phase of there opinion somewhat reluctantly concluding that it was -- I could not say it was sustained by substantial evidence and they could not say it was irrational, but they did sustain it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.128" offset="5151848">And then we will submit some of the points on briefs because there obviously isn't time to cover all these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.278" offset="5208482">We submit that Judge Anderson and Judge Winfield were clearly right that the abandonment delay was as Judge Anderson said, drag in by the heels for the purpose of reducing the liquidation value that which both courts had formerly held the bondholders were entitled and there isn't any real dispute here that liquidation value is the proper standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.376" offset="5340871">The deduction of $16 million from liquidation value was found by the Commission was more than a departure in the interest of flexibility or as the Commission said a matter of refinement or a matter of pricing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.434" offset="5413073">It really subverted the whole concept of using liquidation value as the standard and there was no justification for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.239" offset="5460302">From the beginning it was perfectly clear that no application to abandon and liquidate would be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.879" offset="5498859">The three-judge court thought that was clear, the Commission thought that was clear and it's perfectly evident from the whole course of these proceedings that no such application should have been granted -- would have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.878" offset="5546924">And the requirement that that hypothetical application should be made that these charges in addition to the losses for 1967 should be pilled on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.795" offset="6002604">It had to absorb those losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.151" offset="6007933">Those eroded the values available for the bondholders to the extent of those losses because they were paid off, in some fashion it came ahead of the bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.038" offset="6047535">Now in addition to that loss, what the Commission has done is to put $16 million on top of that to deduct from the value of the assets remaining and therefore has piled it on top of the loss, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.056" offset="6103646">Now there's some details of that pilling on which there is not time to talk about, but they have made up the $16 million by taking first alleged delays in disposing a property, there was a fair amount of non-railroad property, 1,700 pieces of property in all and it would have been perfectly possible during this year to dispose some of that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.339" offset="6200717">They have added on preservation cause, which are not sustained, we think by the record and they’ve added on taxes which after all would not been added to if some of the property was disposed on a reasonable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.776" offset="6254425">So that if you came to look at whether or not there was substantial evidence to sustain the conclusion as to the amount of this loss, you'd find it wasn’t sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.098" offset="6291728">But I prefer to grapple with it on the basis that is a matter of law, it was improper for the Commission to apply this hypothetical loss to reduce the minimum value, the liquidation value to which we submit the New Haven was entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.973" offset="6363303">Now to come to the bulk sale discount, which is in a kind of a curious position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.497" offset="6389321">The Commission held that they have power and to condition an abandonment certificate on requiring that the property be sold in bulk and thus they arrive at the bulk sale discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.175" offset="6460061">In the three-judge court, Judge Friendly thought it was the gravest constitutional doubt above the ability of the Commission to condition an abandonment to which they were constitutionally entitled of losing Railroad upon a sale in bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.197" offset="6540204">And therefore he thought that went beyond their power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.798" offset="6554520">So he sustained the decision of the Commission on a wholly different ground than the Commission had taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.969" offset="6583254">He sustained it on the ground that he found evidence in the record by a witness named Simon that if the property was sold, a bulk buyer would have many risks on which he'd want to get a discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.687" offset="6638111">But that wasn't the basis on which the discount was allowed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.707" offset="6654203">And when Simon's testimony is examined, it is perfectly apparent that he was talking about acquiring this property or such property for development and breaking up in sale, not for bulk use as the Commissions thought it should be without breaking up the Railroad, but breaking it up for development and other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.644" offset="6733928">And I submit that the second ground on which the Commission was sustained was erroneous that there is no foundation for the Commissioner’s ruling in this regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.047" offset="6807594">Certainly and I think that that stares the -- really stares the three-judge court decision right in the phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.404" offset="6841031">But let me just add a word about scope of review because my friends in the Government say that it's a -- this is a very simple case in which the only question is scope of review that the three-judge court applied Ecker, that Judge Anderson departed from Ecker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.082" offset="6919711">Therefore, you sustained the three-judge court on reversed Judge Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.763" offset="6942386">Mr. Auerbach will present the view that may well be that a court in reorganization with its own independent judicial duty is in a somewhat different position and the ordinary reviewing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.425" offset="7013021">But our position basically that whatever the standard we review, it is perfectly clear that there is no substantial evidence to sustain the Commission on this discounts and that with regard to their conclusion, they reach the decision which is unjust and inequitable under the test both of the Commission's statute and of 77 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.749" offset="7110405">So I would submit to Your Honors that you should affirm Judge Anderson who has lived with this al these years and knows what the discounts were and not pile upon the losses which have taken place through erosion of $65 million, the additional losses which the Commission has imposed upon the New Haven.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.266" offset="7284485">While the Commission has acknowledged that liquidation value was the standard that should be applied with respect to the property of the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.639" offset="7329938">It has failed in several instances to give that liquidation value because it has not understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.800" offset="7358568">But when you go to find liquidation value, what you must find is what the liquidator of that property would receive if he sold it in the method that was best suited to his disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.825" offset="7418650">That was what was wrong with the bulk sale discount and it is what is wrong with the Harlem River evaluation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.873" offset="7614882">That is to say it is either the 18 million or the 22 and a half million because the testimony is the testimony of a same man Mr. McKean and one represents a discount he took on certain liquidation assumptions which were furnished to him and those liquidation assumptions were that all of the electric power would be turned off.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.339" offset="7840684">The problem that you face here is what you mean when you say scrap value, what you mean when you say net salvage value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.198" offset="7876211">Now, I say that what you mean when you say net salvage value is the best use you can make of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.022" offset="7899512">And in this case, to have torn up the tracks, to have taken out the electric power would first have depreciated its value of the New Haven’s asset and then to have sold the portion of it as junk and the balance of it for whatever you could get for it and no sensible liquidator would have liquidated in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.056" offset="7975581">And it was for that reason that Judge Winfield and Judge Anderson both said that it was simply impermissible to permit the assumption, the basis here of liquidation to assume that there would be no service available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.363" offset="8040782">They were aware that New York City had built a Hunts Point Market and that it had spent a hundred million dollars on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.235" offset="8076309">It was a Food Lifeline in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.628" offset="8085922">It was being served then by a small piece of track which ran -- if you think of it as running north, it is 3,000 feet between the Harlem River yards up to a point where it meets the Port Morris Branch of Pennsylvania Central which was not liquidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.494" offset="8161364">And thence, the two yards, the Oak Point Yard and the Port Morris Yard being cheek by jowl, there is a switch point there that comes on to the New Haven and it continues on up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.594" offset="8209742">In another mile, there is a spare track and that spare track goes another mile with Hunts Point Yards and therefore, they have never seemed that Judge Anderson the possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.044" offset="8259584">Either for the liquidator would tear up to the track and in that way make it impossible to realize the value he could on the sale of his 136 acres in the Harlem River Yards and in the Oak Point Yards and at the same time make it impossible for New York City to have the rail service that it required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.811" offset="8342653">Because most of this -- for 99% of its distance, this came in on Pennsylvania cost and was then switched at the Port Morris yard and then went to Hunts Point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.245" offset="8528332">I think Your Honor on this point there is no remand to the Commission because I think that record is to perfectly clear that if you find that these yards and that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.114" offset="8571800">There is one question however that does raise a problem with respect to the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.033" offset="8599489">In the valuation when the -- when you consider the possibility that the mile and a half of track would be torn up, you then have to consider that on the liquidation hypothesis that that track would continue even if the New Haven for example had to give that track to New York in order to make sure that the traffic continue, then the value of the right of way, which is about $500,000 might have to be subtracted from the 22 and a half million dollars because then you would have valued it twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.887" offset="8742954">However, Judge Anderson clearly felt that there was no danger that New York City would pay a fair price for that right of way in order to preserve the service to the Hunts Point Yards and therefore he did not make that deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.827" offset="8802722">And we submit that that is so perfectly plain incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.055" offset="8819545">That it does not need to be remand again the value of that small piece of right of way which at worst would have been donated to New York City or to the development of the Hunts Point and of the Oak Point and Harlem River yards.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lester C. Migdal</label>
            <text syncTime="2198.572" offset="8897703">It is 3,000 feet from the Harlem River Yards to the Oak Point Yards switch with Penn Central's Port Morris branch, then it runs on another mile until it meets the spare track to the Hunts Point market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.950" offset="8991222">In a certain sense, this unwillingness to permit the New Haven its real liquidation value while always ascertaining that liquidation value is what is being granted, the Commission’s treatment of the Grand Central Terminal is another case in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.712" offset="9082232">For there, the New Haven enjoys the right or enjoyed the right until the closing of bringing its trains into the station and that had this partly by charters that which went back to the 1840’s and it had it partly by virtue of agreements, which had made with the Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.552" offset="9181602">Now that right permitted the New Haven to operate its trains into the station and out of all of the terminal properties and here, we are not talking simply about the station income itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.015" offset="9231444">We are talking about all of the Park Avenue properties in all of the area income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.060" offset="9251610">By agreement, these were being put into the terminal account and all the expenses were coming out of the terminal account to pay the expenses of both railroads, Central and the New Haven in the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.198" offset="9316185">Now obviously, this income grew as the real estate developed and it has become more profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.121" offset="9347845">In 1907, this was a pretty remote part of New York City but that change in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.581" offset="9373654">And the result of that was that as the income increased, the difference between the actual expenses and the income from the properties began to disappear and therefore the parties each year have to contribute less and less out of their own pockets in order to meet the expenses of their operations in the terminal and all of the expenses of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.264" offset="9468426">And there came a time in 1964 and thereafter when in fact there was more income coming in than the total of the expenses both for the fixed charges and taxes on the real estate and the operating cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.273" offset="9520462">Now when that happened, there was excess income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.672" offset="9538017">So that a question then arose as to what the division of the excess income should be between the parties so that you've got excess income and terminal income as the way in which I have divided it now for this discussion and I hope that all of that is clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.809" offset="9734562">And yet it is extremely important understand how the issue with respect to the excess income settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.981" offset="9763297">In the first instance, Central had denied that the New Haven had any right in the income, those properties produced in the event, but the New Haven stopped the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.115" offset="9823796">Now as a result of that in the negotiations between the trustee and Penn Central, no value was allowed for that and we argue that that was all wrong, it was all wrong because this matter had been the nature of the New Haven's interest studies had been litigated in the New York courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.753" offset="9902373">It had gone all the way to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals had said that the New Haven was in effect an equal partner with the Central in the management of those properties and treated them as joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.303" offset="9960573">The Commission however on the first ground gave us this small value of $13 million because it considered that it ought to -- it considered in the first place but there was a great question as to whether it would survive in spite of the rule in the Baltimore case as to whether we have a real interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.389" offset="10036955">And on the second place it considered that it ought to use as either end of the equation 41% on one side because that was our traditional car use in the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.924" offset="10095052">And $5 million which was a certain nuisance value attributable to the claim and it split the difference and came out with $13 million and it was important that at this point, Judge Van Voorhis was named to look into the question because the result of his decision was to declare that the New Haven Railroad was in fact an equal partner and that it was an equal partner in an indefeasible way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.975" offset="10207274">And therefore, the New Haven's interest in that excess income, the profits from the operations had to be fully valued and we have to be fully paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.642" offset="10245935">And they say that its declaration that we were an equal partner and that that interest was in fact indefeasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.525" offset="10277491">It is very important for the purpose of understanding what ought to have happened to the $5.6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.986" offset="10307271">What we had is Penn Central's witnesses themselves testified to was the greatest bargaining history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.788" offset="10334542">We had a right to come in to that terminal with our trains and because the terminal income was so great, we did not have to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.624" offset="10365889">And therefore, the question is, why now when that valuable interest is turned over to Penn Central so that Penn Central can perform the service we formally performed and perform it without cost because it’s utilizing the same income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.165" offset="10428061">Why should Penn Central not be required to pay for it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.341" offset="10452720">Now I must say that if you read Judge Friendly's opinion on this point, you will see on the first round of review, you will see that essentially there was only one ground in spite of all the grounds that I finally talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.222" offset="10516250">There is only one ground that really determined his decision and that was his view whether if we stop running, if the New Haven stopped operating, whether anybody would acquire our right, whether anybody would be interested in doing that or whether it was so speculative that somebody would acquire that right that we ought not to be paid for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2631.962" offset="10631189">But it was inevitable that somebody would acquire it because if nobody would acquire it, then precisely what the Chief Justice adverted to with respect when he spoke to Mr. Seymour would have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.539" offset="10693569">This would have gone on until we would have been drained of all equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.910" offset="10711019">On the one hand, we will not permit to stop the operations because it was vital to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.337" offset="10732753">And on the other hand, it was conceived by Judge Friendly that there might not be somebody who would pick up that service and would perform it for its own people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.088" offset="10987708">And I think that if you look at Judge Friendly’s opinion, you will note that he says that it was possible to conceive of the possibility that the service would only be acquired as far as Woodlawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.813" offset="11030653">And in Woodlawn, those 30,000 daily passengers would be discharged each morning to walk four blocks to the nearest Bronx subway station and then they could find their way to work somehow and then go back in the evening the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.623" offset="11081853">And I submit that that simply was an impractical solution that Judge Friendly should have noticed from the very beginning and the Commission should have recognized from the very beginning that there was no possibility that that service would cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.526" offset="11137442">New York and Connecticut had testified repeatedly in the train discontinuance case for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.763" offset="12154441">But I would say this, under our best method of liquidation, we would not have as Penn Central says on page 98% of its brief, it mustn't assume that the tracks, or assume to have been dismantled and would attract so long the New Haven’s right away torn free use of the terminal can be of no value than the New Haven because that’s not a proper method to liquidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.810" offset="12242631">And I also point to the past case decided in New York where you have the same situation, you have something that was of use, you had a tunnel but the Hudson Manhattan Railroad Company was making no money with it and it was prepared to stop, but the commuters needed the service, the state took the property and when the state took the property, it did not attribute a zero value to it because it had no value in the hands of Hudson Manhattan Railroad Company, it attributed a fair value to it because that’s what the state was using it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.561" offset="12373661">It took it for a purpose, it got the value of that purpose and it attributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.627" offset="12389857">The New York Court of Appeals said it was required to attribute a very large value to that tunnel and they say that there is essentially no difference between our Grand Central situation and the past case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.082" offset="12443669">And I can not spend anymore time on the past case, but I do think that a careful reading of that case will show that the circumstances were identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.234" offset="12512319">I should say this, if I could add more word on the Grand Central Terminal's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.975" offset="12547323">I pointed out that there was a question in Judge Friendly's mind as to what value would be put in any event upon the New Haven's right to handle the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.151" offset="12587969">How would you value that if New York State did take it over?</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.898" offset="12606986">And I submit that if you look at the briefs filled here by New York and Connecticut, which are filled in composition to our being given any credit for that unique valuable right, but you will see that all that has happened now is that the states in Penn Central are quarreling over the division of the spoils here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.608" offset="12689847">Otherwise, New York State and Connecticut would now have no interest in this proceeding and I would suggest to you also that 2.17 million can be derived a reading of those briefs as the minimum value, as the minimum value that needs to be capitalized if the New Haven’s right in the Grand Central terminal properties as equal partner is to be vindicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.613" offset="13153782">It must be recalled that with respect to the evaluation of the New Haven property, the property was all calculated on a piece by piece basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.055" offset="13199548">It was estimated how long it would take before you realize those values.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.105" offset="13223790">They were then discounted back to present value so that you had a current market value as of December 31, 1966 for each of the New Haven’s pieces of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.382" offset="13264854">Now with respect to some of the items, with respect to the bonds for example the Penn Central which was given as consideration for the New Haven, the same method was followed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.314" offset="13324622">It was recognized that a 5% bond with a 25-year maturity would not sell at par and therefore a 15% discount was given in order to fund the market value so that what you have on one side of the equation liquidation value, you would have on the other side of the equation liquidation value and those would meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.084" offset="13415737">But the $83.1 million did not represent liquidation value at any point in this case, it doesn't represent it the day and at no time, not since the liquidation value date until the day could that those 950,000 shares have been liquidated for $83 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.211" offset="13500165">We submit that the right there on which the value of those shares is the same day that all the other property was valued, which was December 31, 1966 and the market value on that date 52 million, but was approximately $50 million and therefore there is a gap of some $33 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.264" offset="13584384">There was some argument that it was reasonable to value the shares as of the closing date because after all that’s when we gave our property up and that is when we receive the property back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.653" offset="13625971">But then the shares had a value of $60 million and this was not simply --</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.639" offset="13857938">Now we submit that that is entirely inequitable treatment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.771" offset="13882493">We gave up property that had as the Commission said than conservatively than it had a cash value on the day it was valued and had a cash value on the day it was given up.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.416" offset="13969011">Judge Winfield asked the question, was it within the Commission’s power to order that this be paid for in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.089" offset="13995760">And the answer to that was yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.495" offset="14005373">Now it did not order it be paid in cash, but Judge Winfield's statement that it should have been paid in the cash equivalent we submit is exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.125" offset="14043826">If it was thought too burdensome to require Penn Central either to add to its fix charges by issuing bonds or by raising the cash to have Penn Central pay for it shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.952" offset="14091160">That was easily arranged simply by the addition of more shares which would have had no effect on fix charges and would have had the most miniscule effect on the earnings per share because there are 24 million shares of Penn Central outstanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3661.657" offset="14749968">That at that time the shares would play between 75 and 100 and splitting that difference 87.5 you have a priced which multiplied by 950,000 shares gave you $83.1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.950" offset="14803153">None of them guessing was necessary and it was all wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.622" offset="14817886">We didn't close in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.178" offset="14828126">We closed at the end of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.042" offset="14839515">The price was not then 87.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.511" offset="14849442">It never reached 87.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.215" offset="14856234">The price then was 63.38.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.825" offset="14866683">All this guesses were unnecessary because history would have shown the fact would have shown just what the price had to be and it was there that the Commission went wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.222" offset="14912240">And Judge Winfield has never yet accepted that and has said that it ought to have been remanded to the Commission so that the Commission can provide the cash equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.493" offset="14953305">Now we have tried not to interfere with the underwriting formula farther than we had too in order to avoid that remand because this proceeding is going on now for some nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.266" offset="15028433">The underwriting in a certain sense does ensure if there are some small corrections made to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.737" offset="15054346">It doesn't ensure that we will eventually receive $83.1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.463" offset="15073259">We have had however in effect just a part payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.129" offset="15091858">That part payment is either $60 million or a $50 million of the $83.1 million and the balance is still to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.165" offset="15128012">We are general creditors in effect for the rest but we have none even a purchased money mortgage with respect to that balance and nobody would have transferred all his real estate here for a part payment without taking back at least the purchase money mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.645" offset="15186004">The underwriting provides us no security but that payment will ever be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.013" offset="15203453">And then we say is one of its vices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.234" offset="15216306">A second vice that we assigned of the underwriting formula is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.075" offset="15235636">We are now not receiving any income with respect either to the 23 or 33 millions of consideration that we didn't receive and so we have said we ought to be paid interest on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.462" offset="15293210">And that interest when it was required that New York -- when The New Haven was borrowing from Penn Central under the loan loss formula that interest was at the prime rate and we submit that, that's the very least that it ought to be paid on the unpaid portion now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.040" offset="15371577">There is one other deficiency in the underwriting and with that correction the bondholders could accept and not insist on the balance of the share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.405" offset="15412955">Judge Friendly have -- Judge Anderson have provided us a part of that underwriting formula, that if Penn Central shares traded at 87.50 for a five-day period then the underwriting would terminate and of course we only look for interest up to the point where we couldn’t liquidate and get 83 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.415" offset="15517027">We're not looking for interest rate out to the end of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.725" offset="15538239">It just depends on when finally the balance of the payment has been made either because the market has reappraised Penn Central shares or because Penn Central has paid them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.397" offset="15584946">But on that five-day termination of the underwriting, we submit that it's unfair to use so limited a period because you could never sell in the market could never absorbed 950,000 shares at that price simply because it could absorb a normal day’s trading and a five-day trading.</text>

            <text syncTime="3931.547" offset="15829556">Our answer to that is, that the underwriting formula contemplated, that Penn Central to avoid that could offer to pick up in 50 share blocks and free itself for the underwriting at anytime it cared too by paying the difference between the then market value in 87.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.985" offset="15899355">So that if there was a real likelihood that that -- that the best of that of the other side of the world would possible Penn Central itself by you exercising the option granted in the underwriting could take that and put forth itself (Voice Overlap) that’s right Your Honor, that’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.059" offset="15967587">There really is no best to both possible worlds here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.002" offset="15983365">Your Honor, this brings me to the last point that I would like to discuss and that is the terrible unfairness of the loan loss formula and the way in which it has worked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.392" offset="16040939">The loan loss formula, we submit, was simply a formula by which the erosion was permitted to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.901" offset="16066957">And by making available to The New Haven cash so that it could continue to operated at a deficient not paying its taxes, not paying its per diem charges, not paying its tort claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.232" offset="16116276">The formula was not a formula for the relief of the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.417" offset="16129024">It was formula which imposed for the losses upon the New Haven and inevitably, for as long as we took the money down we had to run the Railroad and we had to lose money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.264" offset="16172387">Now when this matter was before the Court the last time, the notion was that we were only going to have a very small loss because the formula would take care of all the New Haven's losses and it was predicted that, that loss would be small.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.724" offset="16242291">You will recall it was in a descending scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.041" offset="16251486">Penn Central was to contribute a 100% of a first year losses and then 50% and 25% that Mr. Justice Douglas wrote about that in his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.361" offset="16296835">Now what has happened is that we did close in the first year and having close in the first year, the losses that were contributed under the Commission formula was only $5 million but the Commission knew one month before it ordered the closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.951" offset="16363186">In November of 1968 when it handed down the remand report that it's guess that those losses would be small and that the $5 million would therefore cover just about all of the New Haven's losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.474" offset="16417311">They knew then that that was untrue that the losses were much, much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.668" offset="16438000">Nevertheless, in spite of our urging they persisted in saying that was as far as they'd go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.057" offset="16463600">Now I submit that if the Commission was right in saying that it was fair for Penn Central to bear a 100% of the first year losses, it should have not withdrawn from that at the point when it found that the losses were larger than they anticipated because it was certainly unfair in the circumstances of this case, where the bondholders were required to absorb $70 million of losses, and I submit to you that the $70 billion was -- $70 millions, I submit to you that that $70 million was $10 million more than the total value with the 950,000 shares we got.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.046" offset="16607587">We were being eliminated, we were being obliterated here and then the say to that 100% of the losses should be altered in the last year and limited to that $5 million imposing $6 million on the New Haven that was improper.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Auerbach</label>
            <text syncTime="4150.712" offset="16706226">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.193" offset="16716152">The trustee of the New Haven Railroad is here as an appellee respondent, arguing on the side on the appellants because he feels very strongly that in the four areas in which the reorganization court differed with the Commission, the court should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.082" offset="16783653">I would address myself to the question which the Government and Penn Central says is probably the most important question and yet a simple question namely scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.846" offset="16834748">The Government says the three-judge court was right, Judge Anderson was wrong on these four points because the Judge Anderson did not review the Commission from the standpoint of the substantial evidence rule whereas the three-judge court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.530" offset="16901517">We don't agree with the Government because while we are satisfied that the three-judge court was bound the substantial evidence rule, we do not think that Judge Anderson as the reorganization court was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.270" offset="16960449">The issue is simple in one respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.115" offset="16967868">Both sides cite Ecker versus Western Pacific as the basis for their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.378" offset="16992841">There's no question that Ecker address to self squarely to the division of functions under the Section 77 of the Commission and the reorganization court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.600" offset="17037772">There is no question that Ecker establishes that valuation of any property and we don't qualify that is the function of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.387" offset="17080926">The question is however, what is the function of the reorganization court in reviewing that valuation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.343" offset="17108720">Is it truly bound by the substantial evidence rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.076" offset="17123662">Our position here is that Ecker doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.395" offset="17136933">Ecker says the contrary, we think further more it should be not bound by the substantial evidence rule because of the unique statute, the legislative history and the reasons why the function of the reorganization court spelled out in detailed that is in Section 77 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.604" offset="17217808">Now let me address myself just very briefly at each of these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.858" offset="17234840">In Ecker, the Court said that while the judges not to review valuation as such the judge is to determine with such additional evidence as he deems appropriate this is not a quote but this is my reading of Ecker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.592" offset="17301713">The said judicial evidences he deems appropriate whether the Commission in fact did obey the statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.460" offset="17341210">Now why would this be so?</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.507" offset="17349360">Now, this comes, I think fairly from the fact that the statute Section 77 is wholly unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.653" offset="17381961">Under Section 77, you have an intertwining of administrative law and judicial review such as you can't find a parallel at any other statute to my knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.101" offset="17427728">In the first place, the background of Section 77 was to find the way of having some method of reorganizing railroads and I'll come back in the moment to the year it was 1933 which it got rid of equity receiverships a as function which took away from the parties who controlled the railroads, the control of the reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.595" offset="17517798">At the same time, you had and this is one of the significant background pieces of reason in the statute, you have railroads going under beginning in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.839" offset="17558758">You did not have other modes of transportation that were fairly competitive that they should -- may have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.736" offset="17582268">You have the problem of a national interest so concern with saving this railroads and a statute which forbid straight bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.334" offset="17620720">You have to reorganize.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.524" offset="17625422">Even today, you can't go into bankruptcy with a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.507" offset="17637439">Section 77 is your only remedy and at the top of that you have an agency with a whole history of expertise and evaluation since 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.453" offset="17681220">It's been evaluating Railroad under Section 19 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.557" offset="17701595">I think every railroad in the county, eventually was valued as required of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.319" offset="17724688">With that background, the Congress fashion a statute under which the Commission will determine the value of the property because in the public interests that would determine the capitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.750" offset="17778395">It would determine, what was the possibility of saving the railroad of making it solvent in the future?</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.603" offset="17801801">The Court would determine and this is the essential point here in this interpretation that with independent hearings whether this plan was fair and equitable, and in determining whether it was fair and equitable, the statute clearly contemplates that it would receive additional evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.026" offset="17871496">I'm not referring to that language in Ecker no, 77 (e) itself contemplates and said so that if the court rejects the plan, it must send it back to the Commission with the evidence which have received.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.835" offset="17918725">77 (e) also points out that persons may come before the reorganization court and this is without regard to whether it was before the Commission and introduce their claims for equitable treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.937" offset="17967104">This brings us really to Mr. Justice Douglas language in the St. Joe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.302" offset="17988629">He said there, the reorganization court function is distinguished from the Commission function and that the Commission is the chief architect under Section 77 (e) and then I think it’s about this shorthand fair in expression is one could imagine because that’s precisely what happens if nobody puts in the plan, the Commission divide it's own plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.002" offset="18087372">While the safeguards in 77 (e) and so far as the Court is concerned but certainly we could not have the Commission both devising its plan and being the reviewing court of its own plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.054" offset="18131571">Now I think the legislative history and I have a very little more time that I can devote to this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.692" offset="18154141">I think the legislative history which is recited in full in Ecker shows, that at one point Congress in the House, as a matter of fact, Congress decided that the whole power should be vested in the Commission and not in the Court but the Senate wouldn't accept that and we find written into 77 (e) the power of review including independent hearings on the part of the reorganization court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.204" offset="18260198">In closing on this point, I would like to bring the attention of the Court that there is no dilemma here between three-judge court and reorganization court under this interpretation of the law, there just isn't any.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.519" offset="18325400">The three-judge court was clearly bound by the substantial evidence rule and made its findings however right or not with that rule in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.569" offset="18357687">Judge Anderson recognized that he was subject to Ecker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.639" offset="18369912">He did not make his findings contrary to Ecker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.547" offset="18385586">He made his findings based on the Section called Methods of Valuation which appear in Ecker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.282" offset="18408469">The question whether these two principle discounts for example were proper deductions from the liquidation value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.720" offset="18438248">I think, if the Court please, that it's fair to say here that there is every reason to recognize a different rule of review under 77, and I would point out to the Court to hearken back to 1933 for a moment that this is an extremely important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.772" offset="18514422">It was in the last eight and a-half years, not only has the New Haven petitioned in 7, but we've had two more eastern railroads the center of New Jersey and now with Boston and Maine and the question of the impact and the railroad of impact of Section 5 and 77 is not one which can be put on the shelf as being pass off just in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.092" offset="18599790">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="4655.204" offset="18724237">Three organization plan was made possible because of the happenchance that during the course of the New Haven bankruptcy, Penn and New York Central applied for permission to merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.791" offset="18770526">In this merger, the New Haven trustees saw both a threat and an opportunity as their counsel stated to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.887" offset="18814934">Inclusion in Penn Central, in the view of the trustees afforded the only practicable means for reorganization of the debtor that would be consistent with the best interest of the public and of all parties interested in the debtor's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.449" offset="18869164">They quickly filed for inclusion in 1962 within three months after Penn and Central asked permission to merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.239" offset="18904377">Under decision of this Court the Commission had no power to force the inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.621" offset="18925902">At all stages, the inclusion depended on the volition of the owners of the New Haven for five years until 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.694" offset="18958190">No bondholder objected to the course being pursued by the trustees and at that time the reorganization court rejected the sole objection presented by the Committee since that objection failed to receive the support of either manufacturers or chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.522" offset="19025481">Now this is been a long and difficult assignment for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.230" offset="19048260">In no reorganization has the process of valuation been more meticulous or more carefully supervised by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.999" offset="19083368">The oral hearings in 1967 extended over 37 days in over a period of five months during the period of five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.018" offset="19123493">Further hearings were held before a Special Master of the reorganization court and then more hearings before the Commission on remand of the inclusion report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.770" offset="19154422">The entire Commission considered and reconsidered this extensive record in three reports dealing with the valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.948" offset="19187127">The bondholders’ initial approach before the Commission was to value the New Haven as a freight only railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.405" offset="19213040">This was not merely in response to evidence presented by Penn Central but rather they apply to the reorganization court for order number 324 in July of 1965 for funds to complete such a study and at the pre-hearing conference in 1966, they announced that “studies are being made with a view to evaluating the railroad as a freight only operation” and the study was in fact presented in the hearings in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.000" offset="19323382">It may -- it might have been possible to reorganize a portion of the railroad to provide freight service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.122" offset="19351907">It was not explored in any depth by the Commission since the study presented by the bondholders did not project freight only earnings beyond the year 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.110" offset="19387852">The valuation of the New Haven presented the Commission was a true dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.114" offset="19407809">There was no reliable forecast of earnings for the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.840" offset="19422751">As Judge Friendly stated in his first opinion “A fair price for New Haven on the usual basis of capitalization of earnings were thus be negative or at least zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.740" offset="19474369">However, much evidence was presented by the trustees in Penn Central on liquidation value of the railroad.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.925" offset="19499029">The Commission turned to that evidence as indeed showing the maximum value of this railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.020" offset="19523480">Now, we agree of course with counsel for the bondholders that there’s no dispute before this Court as to the applicability of the liquidation value tests.</text>

            <text syncTime="5128.771" offset="20618428">But again we come back to the liquidation value of the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.735" offset="20658343">Penn Central's witness Simon listed several different risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.423" offset="20673076">His primary reference was to the inability to forecast that sales would be made strictly with on schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.191" offset="20736188">There was an additional very large risk on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.060" offset="20751653">The earlier appraisals had not taken into account, the drastic effect that in abandonment of rail service in New England would have on the real estate market in New England.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.913" offset="20803062">And the trustee's appraiser himself testified that if this effect would actually be felt in the economy of Southern New England, his appraisals had been overstated and the Commission did not address itself to quantifying any of these unpriced risks until the remand report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.675" offset="20906088">The reason for that I will come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.746" offset="21010369">The initial hearings on the terms for the New Haven's inclusion were held in 1967 while the courts review the legality the Penn-Central merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.403" offset="21040985">Now the focus on these 1967 hearings was on an agreement entered into between the trustees and Penn Central under which the New Haven properties and freight operations would be transferred to Penn Central in return for stock, bonds, and cash, and Penn Central's assumption of certain liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.053" offset="21111620">The Commission tested this agreed terms first by considering the value of the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.165" offset="21140041">In the absence of perspective earnings the Commission's valuation proceeded as I've stated on the basis of a liquidation of the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.791" offset="21190510">In the sense, as Judge Friendly noted, the liquidation hypothesis created in never, never land but the need to postulate, a liquidation of a huge railroad serving a large geographic area of heavy population also required the Commission to devote it skills and judgment to a great many complex problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.958" offset="21271176">Now just one example, the witnesses for the trustees presented too widely varying overall appraisals of the New Haven properties on a liquidation basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.800" offset="21322585">One appraisal was assumed a six-year period of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.839" offset="21338676">Another appraisal, assumed a 10-year period of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.910" offset="21354977">Under the 10-year hypothesis, it would cost the estate $17 million more in liquidation expenses to realize the same proceeds as under a six-year hypothesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.828" offset="21402728">And in addition, there will be a longer wait for these proceeds and hence the present worth of the proceeds would be less.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.860" offset="21430836">Penn Central also presented the 10-year liquidation study.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.815" offset="21450585">Each study reached the net liquidation value for New Haven of $59.00 less then the trustees’ 10-year study and the 10-year liquidation period consequently would be under either appraisal under this the trustees’ appraisal or Penn Centrals would be many millions of dollars more costly to the estate than a six-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.755" offset="21542431">One further element here, the trustees’ appraisers tend to support a 10-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.427" offset="21569076">They uniformly testified that the six-year period was optimistic and on the low-end of a reasonable range of years for such a major undertaking but on the basis of a finding that the bulk of the liquidation could be completed within the period of six years the Commission conservatively adopted the six-year liquidation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.647" offset="21653922">And consequently the much higher liquidation value than under any of the 10 year studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.247" offset="21684328">And another factor, all of the appraisals assumed that the estate could market the properties immediately and did not consider the need for an abandonment certificate on the valuation date.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.840" offset="21738768">The Commission recognized the need for the certificate but did not reach its value in the inclusion report.</text>

            <text syncTime="6407.811" offset="25734666">The Commission found in its remand report that the unpriced risk of a liquidation should be valued at $6.7 million and it therefore deducted this amount in the computation of the liquidation value.</text>

            <text syncTime="6456.038" offset="25927555">The essential basis of its opinion was that bulk sale discount is a reflection of risks that have not already been accounted for in the earlier appraisals and were for the first time quantified in the remand hearings but the Commission stated this quite plainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.968" offset="26011251">The Commission said and I quote “the bondholders will receive the full economic equivalent of the liquidation value of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6484.898" offset="26043016">The discount merely reflects a market appraisal of the risks that the state avoids.”</text>

            <text syncTime="7443.025" offset="29875493">Their position on the scope of review also seems to bear on their position that no remand will be needed even if the Commission has erred in its valuation of the Harlem River and Oak Point Yards.</text>
            <text syncTime="7459.002" offset="29939336">However, Section 77 (e) states on its face that the Commission shall determine the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="7464.882" offset="29962951">And valuation is not listed among the determinations to be made by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7469.367" offset="29980818">The valuation is placed by the statute within the primary jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7473.937" offset="29999104">The Court of Appeals in the Ecker case adopted the present argument of the trustees and it held that the District Court was required to exercise its own independent judgment on questions of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="7485.736" offset="30046333">This Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7487.307" offset="30052603">This Court held that the District Court’s degree of participation in the reorganization did not include valuation and that Section 77 (e) left the determination of value to the Commission without the necessity of a reexamination by the Court when that determination is reached between material evidence to support the conclusion in accordance with legal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="7510.337" offset="30144763">But to be sure the reorganization court may receive new evidence but as Mr. Justice Douglas stated in the Group of Investors case beside the same day as Ecker, the part of the District Court to receive additional evidence may aid it in determining whether changed circumstances require that the plan referred -- to be referred back to the Commission for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="7533.664" offset="30238072">The third item that I distributed to the Court is an extract from hearings on a Bill that was introduced just after the Ecker and Group of Investors cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7543.738" offset="30278301">That Bill was introduced in the Congress which would -- and would have overturned the decision of this Court in Ecker.</text>

            <text syncTime="7601.814" offset="30510582">Perhaps it would be useful to the Court if that very beginning I stated my view of exactly the liquidation valuation process of the Commission adopted here because I think it's possible to maybe some confusion as a result of the discussion on specific points.</text>
            <text syncTime="7626.837" offset="30610683">The Court by now understands of course that the New Haven was a hopeless railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="7633.025" offset="30635447">It has been written with deficits for years and it was a railroad not only with a passenger deficit but with a freight deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7642.067" offset="30671600">So, if you value this Railroad on any conventional basis, earnings or goodwill or anything of that kind there would be no value involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7653.408" offset="30717053">But it was clear to me reviewing courts as I think that my client would have to concede at the estate and the bondholders were entitled to something.</text>
            <text syncTime="7664.527" offset="30761462">They were entitled to a fair value, so that the only standard that the Commission could apply was liquidation value.</text>
            <text syncTime="7673.915" offset="30799078">Now there is an obvious problem there because this Railroad is never going to be liquidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7682.314" offset="30832619">The Penn Central has been required to take it over and continue the rail operations and to absorb indefinitely the deficits of those operations created.</text>

            <text syncTime="7994.002" offset="32079391">But what it did in this hypothetical liquidation was to try so far as it could to bring that hypothetical liquidation close to what would in fact, have happened if the New Haven had liquidated, had abandoned service and liquidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="8015.670" offset="32166013">Now, that is the basis for the Commission's determination that there should be an allowance for abandonment delaying.</text>
            <text syncTime="8024.482" offset="32201331">It makes that very clear in a passage of pages that occurs in its report about page 146 of that printed volume of the first appendix because the Commission’s view was if you assume there was going to be a liquidation of the New Haven and you have to assume that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8042.568" offset="32273638">If you're going to fix this liquidation value, it's reasonable to say assuming that we will give them a certificate so that they can abandon nevertheless, under the law, and this is true they have to ask us for the certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="8081.593" offset="32429746">And we think that it would be reasonable assuming we'll grant a certificate and assuming that the New Haven stops operating trains which the Commission also assumed.</text>

            <text syncTime="8165.491" offset="32765367">We think they may deserve but my client believes they made a very serious mistake there because that the evidence really required a longer period.</text>
            <text syncTime="8171.837" offset="32790758">But passing that, it said it will take six years to sell the property but before you can start selling it you have to get a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="8182.054" offset="32831613">So, that in this, in the real sense in this hypothetical frame, the date doesn't make too much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="8187.967" offset="32855228">They didn't the first time say six years from so and so would be the liquidation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="8192.895" offset="32874977">They just said six years whenever you started.</text>
            <text syncTime="8196.021" offset="32887411">And what they said, what the Commission seems to me to be finding in the abandonment delay is that in addition to taking six years to sell it, it's going to need another year to get the position to start selling and if you looked at it completely in a hypothetical frame, there’s no doubt they would had to have a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="8218.466" offset="32977272">There's no doubt they didn't have one.</text>
            <text syncTime="8220.782" offset="32986467">Now, it's true they say it's unfair to do it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="8224.415" offset="33000991">You should pretend that we have a certificate because we've been waiting all this time to get in and we've been suffering all these losses.</text>

            <text syncTime="8248.806" offset="33098585">The Commission dealt with that as to the 68th losses and all the courts both courts below sustained it.</text>

            <text syncTime="8569.085" offset="34379734">It doesn't assume a bulk purchaser, it simply a method that the Commission used based on the testimony of an expert witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="8579.293" offset="34420590">A method that the Commission used to value the real property of the New Haven as of valuation date on the assumption that that real property was going to be sold piece meal over six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="8593.497" offset="34477328">That's all that determination of the Commission’s amounted to was this witness who was an experienced in real estate investor and administrator testified that if he were going to value it, this $3000 parcels of property that the New Haven had as of the valuation date, he would go about it in a particular way and they way he went about it was making some computations about the amount of capital that would be involved in the venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="8630.427" offset="34625076">He said 75% mortgage capital at 9%, 25% equity capital at 15%, and by applying those rates of retiring to the cash flow proceeds using the same appraisals that the New Haven people have made and assuming a six-year liquidation of the same way the New Haven people did.</text>
            <text syncTime="8661.724" offset="34750255">He arrived at a figure which he thought represented the value of that amounts of real property as of the valuation date at the end of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="8673.214" offset="34796231">Now, the Commission took his testimony and did a little different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="8678.130" offset="34815875">They took away that average and got 10-1/2% as applied really instead of the 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="8686.712" offset="34850252">So, what this issue about the bulk sale discount really comes down to is simply a question of whether the Commission should have discounted the real properties of the New Haven for the purpose of determining valuation of the valuation date by 6% as it did the first time or by 10-1/2% as he did the second time on the basis of his testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="9292.698" offset="37274206">And the yellow line was at New York Central branch which ran down to the former Port Morris Yard in New York Central and then to an interchange point with the New Haven and any traffic that the New York Central moved to this area was -- of to these yards or to the Hunts Point Market was interchanged at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="9322.429" offset="37393115">Now, the Commission heard this evidence and having heard it found that on all facts that if the New Haven were liquidated which is the hypothesis that we're considering, the Penn Central would not serve these yards and could not be compelled and the reasons that are set forth in our brief at length we think that finding was fully supported by a substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="9350.913" offset="37507009">I just want to say one word about however to make one point clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="9356.681" offset="37530102">The reorganization court took the view that the Penn Central could be compelled as New Haven were liquidated to serve that market operated by the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="9372.620" offset="37593840">The Commission found to the contrary because that traffic is highly unprofitable but even if that it is assumed and this is the point I'd like to make, even if it's assumed that the Penn Central might serve that Hunts Point Vegetable Market or might be compelled to it doesn’t follow that it would serve either of these other two yards.</text>
            <text syncTime="9397.072" offset="37691643">That's -- their only the evidence showed that on average it were only about 13 cars a day went to those yards to serve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="9406.283" offset="37728528">Penn Central would either have to buy from the New Haven in liquidation or somebody else tracks facilities which would be extremely expansive in view of the fact that the traffic would not be profitable anyway and furthermore the evidence shows that it would incur very substantial operating cost for the purpose of this small volume of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9430.462" offset="37825181">Now, as far as the suggestion if they could be compelled to serve them, the Commission disposed to that by examining the facts and saying that there was no evidence of any need for service to these two yards or of that the Hunts Point Market for that matter that would justify requiring service in the public interest and of course the Commission would have to make a contrary finding in order to require our service.</text>
            <text syncTime="9458.368" offset="37936880">So, I think that looking at that whole situation it is quite clear that your mission is determination there which required which is dependent upon evidence as to what the operating conditions were, and also relied to all of the Commission’s own judgment about what the transportation needs were should clearly be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="9481.864" offset="38030817">I may add that we point out in our brief that those evidence before the Commission of the New Haven itself sold a large chunk, one of these yards at exactly the square foot price that was in the appraisal the Commission adopted which was 50 cents of square foot lower than the price on the appraisal that the bondholders now say the Commission was required as a matter of law to adopt so that I think it is, if they were, we have a remand on this question that the Commission might have to have another look at the whole question of evaluation.</text>
