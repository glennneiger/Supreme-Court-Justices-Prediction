            <label>Ms. Rena K. Uviller</label>
            <text syncTime="22.520" offset="195542">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.283" offset="210589">This case presents the first clear opportunity for the Court to determine one of the implications of a landmark case In re Gault.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.205" offset="250190">It affords on a good record, an opportunity which this Court sought, but was unable to seize most recently in the case of Debacker versus Brainard, an opportunity to determine whether a juvenile, maybe found guilty of a law violation and confined for a number of years unless been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that is on proof less than that customarily considered, the highest measure of proof in criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.626" offset="375892">In this case, the 12-year old appellate was found guilty of an act of larceny in violation of the New York Penal Law and while he could have been confined for a maximum of five years, had he been an adult, he faced a maximum confinement of six years because he was tried in a juvenile proceeding in the New York Family Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.668" offset="468052">The determination that he was guilty of this act of larceny was based expressly upon the provision of the New York statute which provides for such finding by mere preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.997" offset="521446">The issue arose briefly in the following context.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.850" offset="540776">The juvenile was tried in a fact-finding hearing in the Family Court and at that hearing, the complainant, a saleslady testified that one night she was at work and while the store was open for business, she and her coworkers did not believe any other people were in the premises, that they were no costumers present.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.500" offset="623428">However, she became alerted at some point that a lavatory door in the back of the premises was locked and a moment or two later, the door opened and a young boy scooted out of the store and out into the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.057" offset="677658">The lady testified that she really had at the most 10 seconds to observe him in profile as he darted by and she saw him from a distance of about 20 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.659" offset="724052">She then proceeded into --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="155.842" offset="728754">But if you see someone that you have known before, isn't one second sometimes enough?</text>

            <text syncTime="161.865" offset="752891">Yes, Your Honor but in this case really it emerged that she knew this boy previously, not at that time but she was confronted by him in a one-to-one confrontation the next night in the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.656" offset="808061">There is nothing in this record to indicate --</text>

            <text syncTime="177.365" offset="814853">What difference does it make which time she drew those conclusions?</text>

            <label>Ms. Rena K. Uviller</label>
            <text syncTime="182.855" offset="836796">Well, it's unclear from this record and I would suggest that the family court judge, in finding a boy guilty, conceded that there was a reasonable doubt in this case about I don't -- it's unclear as to whether he was -- what the doubt was about that the lady had an opportunity to see him or when she made the determination that this was someone that she had known previously.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.877" offset="932927">What did she say about having known him previously?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="209.641" stopTime="305.688">
            <label>Ms. Rena K. Uviller</label>
            <text syncTime="209.641" offset="944003">She said -- after she saw the boy scoot out she called the police office and she was then called to the police station the next night where she saw the boy and she testified in court that she knew this boy very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.563" offset="991650">And she said that she had seen him on many previous occasions when he had come to her store and that she had thrown him out as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.191" offset="1042223">The boy of course and his mother and his uncle all testified that he was not at all -- that he was home and could not possibly have been out of his house that entire evening and testified to an alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.221" offset="1094259">He of course also denied that he ever knew this lady before, but I would suggest that it would be inappropriate here for us to again consider what entered into the fact finder's mind when he was making this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.020" offset="1161550">He did assess the credibility of various witnesses and had before him the fact that the lady did see him in an inherently suggestive situation the next night and determine that he did have a reasonable doubt about this boy's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.180" offset="1218184">This was quite developed in a record and the judge most candidly noted that he was applying a different standard of proof then would have applied in adult situation and that therefore the finding was not ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.787" offset="1264577">And I would submit that at this point, what we are here to consider is the appropriateness of the measure of proof that the fact finder applied as opposed to what went into his determination that the child was guilty by the standard the he applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.719" offset="1424342">Mr. Justice Harlan there is no express holding to that effect, but I would suggest that the reason of that is so is that this so widespread standard, it has such fundamental antecedents that holding to that effect has never been necessary.</text>

            <label>Ms. Rena K. Uviller</label>
            <text syncTime="346.475" offset="1491320">Yes it is, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.071" offset="1501665">I would like to say at the outset that to seek a denomination of the proceeding here involved, either civil or criminal, would be futile and would really only obscure the question that we have to deal with because it is our basic contention that whatever we call these proceedings, juvenile proceedings, to find a child guilty of law violation and to incarcerate him for a substantial period of time unless, unless then the most certain standard of proof known to our law is a violation of due process and it is a violation of due process, I would submit, however that concept maybe defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.359" offset="1662892">Whether it is as in Mr. Justice Black's, view the law of the land where an adult is accused of a crime and confined or whether it is considered the fundamental fairness of the proceedings and although much has been said by this Court and other courts about the fairness of this standard where liberty is at stake for law violation, I would just like to reiterate a couple of considerations and that is the standard after all expresses an attempt to reduce the chance of risk when an innocent person is going to be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.661" offset="1812104">It is a flag as it were to the fact finder that you must be very, very certain that this is the person that did the act and in fact as this Court noted in Coffin against the United States many times, many years ago, it is really in fact a corollary to the presumption of innocence and I would doubt that anyone would suggest that that most fundamental presumption should not attach to somebody who is accused merely because of his age and of course a reasonable --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="456.250" offset="1930386">Well, is that the only reason for it, merely because of his age or is it because whether misguided or well-advised, a system of juvenile courts was set up to take people under a given age out of the criminal process and away from the stream of criminal proceedings and to protect them, isn't that the background?</text>

            <label>Ms. Rena K. Uviller</label>
            <text syncTime="478.108" offset="2017844">Mr. Chief Justice, yes precisely and we make no challenge to the policy of a legislature, which seems to be uniformed throughout the country, to establish separate courts apart from the criminal process to try and deal with young offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.148" offset="2094017">We don't challenge the assumptions on which that legislative policy is based.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="501.009" stopTime="507.129">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="501.009" offset="2109482">In New York, is there a judgment of guilt in a criminal act in this kind of a proceeding?</text>

            <text syncTime="510.336" offset="2146785">My only contention is that within these specialized courts, designed as you suggest to save youngsters before they become perhaps “non-rehabilitatable,” if there's such a word, to offer them special kinds of services, but we only ask that within these special courts the limitations of the Constitution apply, so that fundamental fairness is recognized and observed.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.399" offset="2267052">Yes and I think a child, a young offender, is indeed entitled to that and I would like to just for a moment deal with one of the contentions that the city has raised about this confinement procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.015" offset="2337479">The City of New York has suggested well, there are other kinds of confinement that are based upon a preponderance of the evidence and suggest this is -- does not differ from those kinds of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.979" offset="2385335">And the city cites such things as the confinement of mentally ill people and alcoholics and narcotics addicts and I would say that it really strains the analogy to compare this kind of a case with that kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.244" offset="2442386">In those cases, you're dealing essentially with the distillation of medical testimony relating to a physical or mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.669" offset="2484078">Expert opinions, subject to very honest differences of opinion, what is an alcoholic or how sick is this person, but here we're talking about, did Johnny Jones do X on Y night?</text>

            <text syncTime="607.208" offset="2534233">Well, let's assume you may be right with respect to commitment of the incompetence or narcotics addicts or alcoholics and so on, but coming closer to home right here in New York, as I understand the city's argument that children maybe confined and maybe confined in substantially or exactly the same place that this young man was confined after finding that there are persons in need of supervision and I would gather that doesn't need all sorts of expert testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.739" offset="2676339">That's not a -- and would you concede that in order to support a finding that a young person is in need of supervision that preponderance of the evidence is all that's required?</text>

            <text syncTime="656.297" offset="2730569">Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, I would say that of course there is some distinction because in one case we're talking about a law violation and in another case not but --</text>

            <text syncTime="671.330" offset="2790755">I would say, however, that the way the statute reads in New York, there is some question and it's rather broadly defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.360" offset="2826909">However, as a matter of practical, as a practical matter, in New York, the courts have required that when someone is charged with being a person in need of supervision that he's incorrigible, that one may not merely accuse him of being incorrigible that one must charge specific acts of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.465" offset="2899320">One must show that Johnny Jones was out away from home for two weeks from such and such date to another date, that he has been drinking intoxicating beverages, that he's associating with bad company namely, Sam Smith etcetera, etcetera, and that must be proved.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.782" offset="4052574">That goes much closer to changing the posture of the Court perhaps not in New York but elsewhere than a simple requirement that before you give the child these services, and there is some debate as to how effective they are, you must be very sure that he really needs them, that he has committed that robbery that shows that he needs help.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.362" offset="7166892">I think that it may be a little misleading to suggest that the judge in the family court said that if the standard of proof was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, he would have reached a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.730" offset="7232303">And early in my brief, I discussed this in quote from the appendix as to what happened at that point and if this becomes an element in the case which I rather doubt, I think the Court should look at what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.786" offset="7300535">Because the judge made his finding in accordance with the law and then counsel for the trial started what ended up as philosophic discussion about the various standards of proof and the judge then made some remarks which in the appellant's brief have all been telescoped even though they're page apart and gives the feeling that he is talking about this specific case, when apparently he is talking about determinations in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.784" offset="7436581">Now, let me turn to the central issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.878" offset="7456956">The question is whether the Constitution requires that in the proceeding of this kind, there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that the preponderance of the evidence standard is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.817" offset="7528636">Now, there is no specific constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.191" offset="7542220">So the question comes down to whether due process requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.675" offset="7564163">And as I see it that either must go along one of two paths; either that in a criminal case, you must have such proof and this is a criminal case or two the nature of what happens after this proceeding, the loss of liberty, the incarceration, the possibility of that is of such a nature that due process requires that standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.035" offset="7705537">Aside from those two paths, I cannot see how this can be decided as a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.810" offset="7732705">Now, much of the discussion we've had in this field and I've seen it in some opinions in the Law Review articles discuss this without referring to the Constitution on the assumption that due process is what I think is wise and if I think this is wise, the Constitution requires it and obviously, this court does not approach the problem that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.978" offset="7841374">Now, let's see whether this is a criminal proceeding and here I suggest that Mr. Justice Fortas in the Gault opinion was writing far ranging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.192" offset="7910233">He was writing about the entire juvenile system and he was dealing with a case which at least to me seemed quite horrendous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.212" offset="7950252">And what he did was from all the writings, studies, very often students at the law school probably had never seen a juvenile court, what they wrote, he was picking out all the things that went wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.064" offset="8025694">If something went wrong in Oregon which didn't go wrong in any other state that was listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.651" offset="8060071">Now, it seems to me that we're dealing with the question of whether the Court is the equivalent of a criminal court, we must deal in this case with the New York Court.</text>
