            <label>Mr. Johnnie McKeiver Walters</label>
            <text syncTime="44.768" offset="282415">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.242" offset="308328">The relevant facts in this case were stipulated and may be summarized in pertinent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.515" offset="341452">In August 1953, Hilton Hotels Corporation owned some 325,370 shares of the 366,040 shares outstanding of the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria leaving some 40,670 shares of Waldorf outstanding in the hands of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.027" offset="463496">Contemplating a merger, Hilton retained consultants to do a study to determine a fair basis for exchange of Hilton shares for Waldorf shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.081" offset="531728">Hilton and Waldorf agreed upon a proposed merger with Hilton to be the surviving corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.707" offset="566209">Under the proposed plan, Hilton offered to exchange 1.25 shares of its stock for each share of the Waldorf stock it did not already owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.538" offset="633501">Prior to the agreement of merger, however, shareholders owning some 20,000 shares of Waldorf filed with Waldorf an objection to the merger and demanded payment for their Waldorf stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.133" offset="715943">Thereafter, on December 28 and 29, 1953 more than 2/3 of the stock holders of each of the two corporations voted approval of the merger and on December 31, 1953, the merger agreement and certificate of consolidation were filed with the Secretary of State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.906" offset="830986">The applicable New York law provided that in such a case the stockholder demanding payment for his Waldorf shares have no right to receive dividends payable on those shares after the close of business on the day preceding to the date that the Waldorf stockholders voted approval of the merger and that upon that vote the dissenting stockholder ceased to have any of the rights of a stockholder of Waldorf except the right to receive payment of the value of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.074" offset="1007679">Under the New York law, the dissenting stockholder or the corporation have the right to have the stock appraised in a Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.904" offset="1055013">Complying with New York law on January 7, 1954, Hilton offered to the Waldorf stockholders $24.54 for each share of Waldorf stock it did not already own.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.619" offset="1137873">Those stockholders who had dissented from the merger rejected the offer and began Court proceedings under state law for a determination of the buyer of their shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.350" offset="1200776">Hilton again retained the same consulting firm to determine the value of those Waldorf shares on the date prior to the vote of approval of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.593" offset="1265768">In addition to paying those consultants, Hilton also paid almost $40,000.00 to lawyers and others in connection with the Court proceedings to develop that value.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.940" offset="1339120">Hilton claimed a deduction as an ordinary and necessary business expense under Section 162 of the code for all of the fees paid to the consulting firm, attorneys and others including the fees that have been paid to the consultants prior to the vote of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.569" offset="1441625">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.627" offset="1461896">Hilton paid the asserted deficiency and commenced a suit for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.330" offset="1496691">The District Court held that the appraisal costs were deductible but that the consultant's fees that were incurred prior to the merger were nondeductible capital expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.536" offset="1573491">Hilton conceded as to those pre-merger fees and the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court allowing deduction of the appraisal fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.833" offset="1918725">The sole issue here then is whether the fees paid to the consultants, lawyers and others, in connections with the appraisal proceedings that followed the merger are deductible ordinary and necessary business expenses are non-deductible capital expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.027" offset="2015483">What we're concerned in this case with Section 162 which deals with business expenses and also with Section 263 again as in the last case, we nevertheless are concerned with the same basic principles that were involved in the Woodward case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.405" offset="2109001">Section 162 provides a deduction for the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year and the carrying on of the trade of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.658" offset="2158007">It does not provide a deduction for a capital expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.714" offset="2182248">Section 263 on the other hand prohibits deductions of a capital expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.015" offset="2215476">The origin and character of the claim with respect to which an expenditure is incurred determines or contributes to the determination of whether an expenditure is or is not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.779" offset="2282454">The cost of acquiring an asset and capital stock are not deductible.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.248" offset="2424351">Just as the Seventh Circuit noted below, the expenditures incurred in connection with a corporate reorganization such as the ones that Mr. Justice White just asked about are nondeductible capital expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.972" offset="2503241">In considering these keys along side the Woodward case, there is only one additional item that we think we should mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.085" offset="2543679">In Woodward, the majority shareholders did not acquire title to the (Inaudible) stock prior to the appraisal proceedings whereas in this case, under the applicable New York law, the merger and the acquisition were both accomplished prior to the appraisal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.994" offset="2655378">This difference in timing is only one that we think we need to address attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.653" offset="2693935">The timing --</text>

            <text syncTime="648.248" offset="2696338">Well, the Eighth Circuit has decided this case very recently, am I right?</text>

            <text syncTime="663.898" offset="2758928">No sir, it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.514" offset="2785468">The timing of the appraisal proceeding with respect to the title passage is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.481" offset="2817337">The appraisal proceeding in this case too was directly and functionally related to and an integral part of the overall proceeding which was a corporate reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.554" offset="2889540">This was not a causal relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.546" offset="2901556">It was part and partial of the overall transaction the corporate reorganization and the acquisition of the Waldorf shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.424" offset="2957040">Thus, again, we note that the tax law does not permit fragmenting of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.554" offset="2985566">It requires events that are functionally related to be looked at together even though they maybe temporally separated time-wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.938" offset="3043140">We submit that such differences as exist between this case and the Woodward case are immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.220" offset="3080234">In the context of these cases, the differences in timing of the stock appraisals is not material and likewise the differences between the New York and Iowa statutes are not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.388" offset="3156929">The federal tax rules in the two cases should be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.914" offset="3178977">In neither case should the cost of these appraisal proceedings be deductible and Woodward, the Eighth Circuit held at the appraisal cost were not deductible capital expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition of capital stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.847" offset="3274794">In this case, the cost of the appraisal likewise should be considered a part of the cost of acquisition of the Waldorf stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.467" offset="3325262">In either case, the appraisal cost were capital expenditures.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.299" offset="3540616">I will then show that the merger and the appraisal proceedings were not functionally related, so that rules with respect to mergers are not applicable to the appraisal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.945" offset="7111137">The appraisal proceeding was not part of the cost of acquisition because shares were acquired prior there to and the appraisal proceeding had no effect on the acquisition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.335" offset="7260662">Title involvement its necessary touchstone is absent from the appraisal proceeding because title to shares of stock of the dissenters had from them long before the appraisal proceeding was started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.113" offset="7327848">Most of the Government cases sighting the application of the windmill rationale involved title, so the cases cited by the Governments are clearly not applicable and if the cases didn't involve title, they involved the recasting of sales price by a Court with respect to a sale induced by fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.560" offset="7437563">Again, a bargaining process or the cases involved the reaching of agreement by as to price prior to title being passed or the cases involved taking the necessary steps to consummate the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.664" offset="7510079">The more appropriate cases as authority for this case is a case of Petrick decided by the Second Circuit involving a confiscation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.744" offset="7562324">In that case, the taxpayers' property was confiscated by a foreign government and the proceeding determining the award was based upon the value of the property confiscated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.950" offset="7619166">There the Second Circuit held at the legal cost in the proceeding were deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.329" offset="7652707">Another relevant cases the Naylor case decided by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.097" offset="7679770">In that case an option was exercised to purchase stocks and the parties agreed that title had passed but the option price was set at the book value of the shares of stock at a certain date and the taxpayer hired an attorney because a dispute arose as to book value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.024" offset="7787499">The attorney's fees were held to be deductible because title had passed before the attorney was hired and he was hired merely to collect the correct amount of the purchase price which was a standard set by agreement among the parties' book value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.235" offset="7868270">The Government's reliance upon titled cases is misplaced and rather the Petrick case and the Naylor case are more appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.114" offset="7915813">The Government contends that the origin and character of the appraisal proceeding was in the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.750" offset="7954369">Essentially, the argument is had there been no merger, there be appraisal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.100" offset="7983731">But the cause of the appraisal proceeding was not the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.421" offset="8001076">The cause of the appraisal proceeding was in the objection and demand for payment by the dissenters, had there been no such objection or demand for payment there would be no appraisal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.927" offset="8055097">The merger had been completed and the dissenters could not affect the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.758" offset="8074428">The acquisition of the dissenters' stock had been completed and the dissenters could not affect such acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.565" offset="8109641">It was not from the merger or as a part of the acquisition that the appraisal proceeding arose but it wasn't a debtor-creditor relationship established between the dissenters in Waldorf and the fact that they could not agree on the fair value of the dissenters' shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.613" offset="8181844">There was no functional relationship between the appraisal proceeding and the merger and the rules with respect to mergers should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.286" offset="8240567">The Government states that distinctions in state law should not govern federal tax consequences and the Government in its brief cites cases where there was no substantive difference in state law or where state law put different labels on the same property rights as authority for the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.385" offset="8332936">However, we all know that in private contracts trying to accomplish similar ends, different tax consequences can depend upon title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.585" offset="8389674">There is one case in the lower courts other than Woodward in which the appraisal proceedings were held and to be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.226" offset="8448293">This is a District Court case Boulder Building Corporation and it was decided under the appraisals statute at 18 Oklahoma statutes annotated 1.161(a) 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.742" offset="8506389">I will quote this statute to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.684" offset="8518092">“Holders of dissenting shares of a domestic corporation shall continue to have all the rights and privileges incident to their shares except just expressly limited by this section until such time is a fair value of such shares be agreed upon or determined by judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.357" offset="8604818">There were no appraisable limitations under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.336" offset="8620701">I submit that under the Oklahoma statutes, the dissenters remain shareholders and they could have resumed their status shareholders which is entirely different in the state law in New York when they had forever lost their status as shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.373" offset="8696874">The Government says, ignore title when you decide this case but one must always be concerned with title if one is going to impose capitalization because the title acquisition is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.724" offset="8762284">Hilton does not urge the use of the primary purpose test in this case because the sole purpose of the appraisal proceeding was to determine the value of the shares, the amount of the debt owed by Hilton and there was no element of title involved in the appraisal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.565" offset="8893628">Your Honor, I think there is a distinction between setting a price and paying a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.549" offset="8917556">We have agreed, Hilton had agreed to pay a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.552" offset="8933543">It was a price that was imposed upon it by state law and the state law had evolved a procedure to determine the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.010" offset="8983385">We are questioning -- the problem we have is to categorize the expenses in determining the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.023" offset="9011493">There is no question that the price itself was for an acquisition yet title was not involved in the price determination proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.457" offset="9065200">The title was involved in the acquisition which had incurred for the price determining proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.518" offset="9121416">In summary, the expenses of Hilton in the appraisal proceeding should not be capitalized because title was not involved in the appraisal proceeding and Hilton acquired nothing as a result of the appraisal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.710" offset="9206262">In addition, the appraisal proceeding having resulted from the demand for payment and the inability for the debtor and creditor to agree in price was not functionally related to the merger, so the merger rules should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.481" offset="9289331">It is respectfully submitted that those expenses in the appraisal proceeding are ordinary and necessary expenses deductible under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>

            <label>Mr. Johnnie McKeiver Walters</label>
            <text syncTime="2320.017" offset="9383476">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.894" offset="9398941">I'll just mention on or two items briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.001" offset="9423391">Again, we submit these two cases bring to this Court two instances where a taxpayers would deduct the cost of determining the value of capital stock which capital stock had to be acquired at one instance by individual taxpayers and the other by corporation in connection with corporate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.307" offset="9544600">The fact that the timing of this cost came either before or after, we submit, is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.109" offset="9587858">These costs were incurred as a part and parcel of the overall transaction in each instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.193" offset="9624116">Accordingly, we submit that the Court should decide these two cases alike and the Eighth Circuit held that they were capital expenditures and the Woodward case and the Hilton case the Seventh Circuit held they were deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.092" offset="9703737">We think that they Eighth Circuit is right and that the Seventh Circuit is wrong but we submit most urgently that whatever the answer is we need one rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.958" offset="9763192">These are not isolated instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.693" offset="9778134">There are many, many corporate reorganizations, mergers and other items actions taking place today where this is going to be a recurring event so we need a rule for taxpayers and the Government alike.</text>

            <label>Mr. Johnnie McKeiver Walters</label>
            <text syncTime="2443.000" offset="9875414">Mr. Justice, there are several decisions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Johnnie McKeiver Walters</label>
            <text syncTime="2447.093" offset="9891715">Yes sir, where they've gone both ways really.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.764" offset="9910418">We submit that the better view is that applied in the Woodward case because we do not see how you can separate out this appraisal proceeding which is required to determine the value or the price of the stock from the overall transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.268" offset="10012400">Now, as to the possible distinctions between the two statutes involved in this case, again, we say they're immaterial because if you cut away the brush and look at the main transactions that we have here, it seems clear to us that these expenditures were incurred in the purchase of capital stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.986" offset="10123368">You do not see how can find otherwise when you look at the whole picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.339" offset="10152730">We have mentioned very briefly the point Mr. Justice White has brought out in questioning if Hilton felt that the timing was as important as it is then we submit that they could very well have justified, at least arguably deducting the cost, the price that they paid for the stock too because that came before the acquisition also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.757" offset="10298389">In fact, we submit that the concession by Hilton that the pre-merger expenses incurred, expenditures for the consultants, constitute nondeductible capital expenditures indicates that they too feel that the decision in the Woodward case is correct.</text>
