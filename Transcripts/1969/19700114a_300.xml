          <turn speaker="omer_luellen" startTime="14.212" stopTime="414.025">
            <label>Mr. Omer Luellen</label>
            <text syncTime="14.212" offset="160266">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.613" offset="225782">Chief Justice Burger and Associate Justices of this Honorable Court, this case 300 was a petition for writ of certiorari on the Tenth Circuit it pertains to the approval or none approval of the will of an Indian who owned first a restricted properties pursuant to our federal statutes governing the disposition of Indian lands upon the death of an Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.635" offset="413863">I feel certain that this Court is familiar with the fact that the governing statutes under which we are discussing this case are found in two sections commonly called 1910 Act, Section 1 of the 1910 Act which now has been codified as 25 U.S.C. 372 and Section 2 of the 1910 Act which has now been codified as 25 U.S.C. 373.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.620" offset="565896">372 pertains to the determination of the heirs of a deceased Indian that has an allotment or who will in the future have an allotment upon his death dying without a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.524" offset="633501">And Sections 1 or 372 proceeds to state that upon the death of the said Indian his heirs shall be determined by the Secretary of the Interior and his decision shall be final and conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.780" offset="706539">Then we have Section 2 of the 1910 Act which is codified as 25 U.S.C. 373 which states that if an Indian dies owning an interest in trust and thus it really say an Indian assess any person die owning an interest in trust or restricted lands or funds that are restricted unless he shall have the right -- this person shall have the right to make a will provided the will shall not have any force or effect until and unless -- unless and until it is approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.262" offset="908413">Now, that is the general situation here, this Indian, George Chahsenah later will in -- his last will of March 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.853" offset="970794">He was a member of the Comanche Tribe of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.297" offset="984586">He lived at a little town of Apache, Oklahoma located about 20 miles north of Fort Sill or Lawton, Okalahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.849" offset="1010813">Any of you gentlemen or any members of this Court have ever been to Fort Sill in World War I or World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.489" offset="1037354">Actually, it's about 25 miles north of Fort Sill.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.602" offset="1049788">George Chahsenah was a member of the Comanche tribe of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.975" offset="1059297">He made his will -- his last will.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.338" offset="1068701">He made several wills.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.362" offset="1072776">I'm certain that will be brought out here later.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.960" offset="1083225">His last will is made in March 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.117" offset="1099839">He died approximately five or six months later and the procedure for making wills where the Indians have restrictive trust lands, they go to the field officers of the Bureau of Indians Affairs which in this case of course was an (Inaudible) about 30 miles on north of Apache, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.773" offset="1182490">He went there in March 1963 and made his last will in the office of the Field Solicitor and his will was properly drawn according to the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.978" offset="1231287">Then he died some six months later and his will of course was presented for probate and several hearings were held before the Examiner of Inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.750" offset="1274337">Can our blame who had the position of Examiner of Inheritance, it's a position created by the Secretary of the Interior giving the Inheritance Examiners a general authority to make determinations concerning with the deceased heirs of Indians who died without wills and also in regard to the approval or non-approval of their wills.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.053" offset="1355630">They had four, I think around four hearings in this case and finally the Examiner of Inheritance made a -- rendered an opinion or ruling or opinion in which he upheld the validity of this will of the George Chahsenah and he approved the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.130" offset="1467852">In his finding, which of course is contained on the appendix, he goes into certain findings about the fact of this Indian apparently was addicted to alcohol and perhaps I should've said prior to this time that in the hearings on his will there were -- the devisees and legatees were represented by legal counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.166" offset="1580074">The certain disinherited nieces and nephews were represented by Mr. Hill and also Dorita High Horse who it was found later by the court to be -- who was found later by the court to be his natural daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.440" offset="1645171">And the Court -- the Examiner of Inheritance felt that -- made a finding that although this Indian apparently was addicted to alcohol and it was an excessive drinker and he make some different wills at different times that the time he made his will, he was perfectly competent to make his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.297" offset="1724583">He was intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.062" offset="1731584">In fact, some of the will was proper in respect and the Examiner of Inheritance has approved the will.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <text syncTime="417.210" offset="1772231">Then an appeal by the contestants of the will, the appeal was taken to Secretary of the Interior as directed by the regulations and at that time the authority to approve or disapprove wills of Indians had been delegated to the Regional Solicitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.065" offset="1851643">Originally I'm up until short time prior to that the -- what those appeals or appeal to the portion on office and usually the Solicitor or the Associate Solicitor of the Department of Interior made these determination but at this time it have been set down by delegation of authority to the Regional Solicitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.684" offset="1930115">And the Regional Solicitor for this region was, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mr. Stanford Regional Solicitor is still a Regional Solicitor upon the hearing before the Regional Solicitor -- upon review before the Regional Solicitor, the Regional Solicitor found that the factum of the will was proper as the Examiner of Inheritance had found.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.338" offset="2040769">He found that this Dorita High Horse was a natural daughter of deceased George Chahsenah and he found although the factum of the will was proper and have a respect, the fact George Chahsenah have apparently have not supported the Dorita High Horse during her minority that there had not been an equitable treatment of the heirs of law of George Chahsenah by his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.655" offset="2158007">And under his exam -- the Regional Solicitor set up from his discretionary authority, he held that equity had not been achieved and he disapproved the will of George Chahsenah and directed that the estate be distributed to his natural daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.394" offset="2248913">Now, he also in his order disapproved or disallowed, he said he would also make the same finding as to any other wills of George Chahsenah and now he had made several other wills prior to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.887" offset="2294888">So, he made that same finding in regard to any other wills.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.753" offset="7398379">I think it would be helpful Mr. Chief Justice if the Court of Appeals were given some standard of review and I think that the standard that they should be given is a very broad one that the Secretary has extremely wide powers in this area, and that a reversal would only be in order if the Secretary had grossly abused his scope of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.330" offset="7488658">I would like, with the Court's permission, to discuss very briefly the historical context in which the General Allotment Act and the Act of 1910 appears because I think it bears -- this historical context bears very heavily on both of them contentions that the Government is making in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.649" offset="7569951">The contention that the Secretary is given absolute discretion, non-reviewable and the contention that the Congress intended for him to exercise a very wide range of considerations in deciding whether to approve or disapprove a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.429" offset="7637138">The General Allotment Act is -- was one of the major aspects of Congress' effort to make Reservation Indians economically integrated and self-sufficient members of the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.887" offset="7682905">Under the allotment system prior to 1934, the Government divided and allotted reservation properties that convey them to individual Indians and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.594" offset="7721775">The properties were conveyed under an arrangement which this Court has characterized not as a technical trust arrangement but as a kind of special guardianship by which the Department of the Interior is entrusted with the duty of restricting alienation of the Indian's interest in these lands and furtherance of a congressional policy which this Court has described as “the promotion of prudence to afford protection to dependent and natural heirs” and also “preserving restricted land for the Indians.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.976" offset="7843297">This Court has recognized that the legal relationship is a very special one between the Government and reservation Indian tribes in communities and that special relationship has survived the break-up of certain reservations and the allotment to individual Indians of tribal lands at least that has survived with respect to the allotted land themselves and at least to the extent that the Government continues to guard against the improvident alienation of these properties by the Indian allottees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.250" offset="7956355">It was Congress' hope at the time when the Regional Allotment Act was passed that the Government's guardianship and the time at which -- from the time of which it would be deemed advisable to remove restrictions would be only about 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.041" offset="8015496">It was hoped that at the end of that time his lands could be conveyed to the Indians in fee simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.362" offset="8036812">In the majority of instances however, removal of the restrictions on alienation soon resulted in the acquisition of these properties by parties unrelated to the Indian allottees usually in fact by non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.747" offset="8086340">In furtherance of the statutory purpose of the Allotment Act which was to preserve the value of the allotted properties for the benefit of the allotted Indians and their families in most cases the period of guardianship has been extended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.679" offset="8278079">I thought that a reminder of the historical background and particularly the historical purpose of the General Allotment Act which was to ensure that these conveyed Indian lands remain for the benefit of Indians and the Indian allottees and their families is rather helpful to an understanding of the statutory context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.847" offset="8350804">It's rather helpful to an understanding of range of the Secretary's powers in approving or disapproving alienation of Indian wills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.855" offset="8386748">The Secretary statutory duty to preserve these lands in the hands of the allottee during his lifetime is supplemented by a duty to supervise the disposition of allotted properties upon the death of the allottee pursuant to the Act of June 25, 1910 which is the Act under consideration of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.687" offset="8462085">And Sections 1 and 2 of this Act taken together provide a complete enumeration of the Secretary's powers over the disposition of allotted properties at the death of the allottee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.923" offset="8503045">Section 1 as you know authorizes the Secretary to determine the legal heirs of the deceased and this determination or statute is to be made under state law in this case, the law of the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.698" offset="8546200">Section 1, as this Court has dealt is aware provides that the Secretary's determination of heirship is to be final and conclusive and requires only that the Secretary hold a hearing with notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.746" offset="8594369">This Court has explicitly held that the Secretary's determinations of heirs are not reviewable by any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.060" offset="8615581">In other words, this Court has specifically held that Section 1 determinations are not reviewable even if errors of law are alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.533" offset="8645465">This is the First Moon v. White Tail case cited in our brief at 270 U.S. 243.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.063" offset="8671587">The Court recognized in the First Moon case, the Secretary's unique and pervasive role with respect to these restricted properties and found that “abundant reason for the provision precluding review become apparent upon considerations of the infinite difficulties which otherwise would arise in connection with the sundry duties of the Secretary of the Interior relative to Indian allotments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.075" offset="8763643">Now Section 2 of the Act of 1910 which is of course the key provision under consideration in this case requires the Secretary in a case in which the deceased Indian hast left a will to approve or disapprove that will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.047" offset="8815574">If the will is disapproved, as it was in this case, the property passes and its entirety by the laws of intestacy, that is the restricted property (Inaudible) in the will.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.974" offset="11323225">And the Mr. Burke cited the primary case to which he thought that Section 2 was directed, which is the case and which an Indian allottee has after-born children who are not covered in the original allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.367" offset="11392815">And in the case to that kind, the Indian would frequently wish to have these after-born children provided for and one way to provide for them would be to give them a disproportionate share of his own allotment upon his death.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.846" offset="14390732">I represented Dorita High Horse and some of the other nieces and nephews.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.908" offset="14407032">Now, bear this in mind that here it is -- this full-blood Comanche Indian was not allottee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.087" offset="14439737">He inherited this land itself from his mother and some of the others on the General Allotment Act of February 7, 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.542" offset="14473592">That was a General Allotment Act which only affect the wide tribes and it did not include the Five Civilized Tribes which a Justice have mentioned awhile ago by Justice Barefoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.482" offset="14509328">I remember the Choctaw tribe itself, but it didn't have any effect upon the Five Civilized Tribes or the Osage tribes themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.500" offset="14533360">But all of these wide tribe particularly the Kiowa, the Comanche, the Apache, the Otos, and Wichita and tribes like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.586" offset="14573693">Now, the first -- after the legislation was enacted in 1910 giving the power and authority to the Secretary of the Interior to determine under Section 372 whether or not the certain heirs were entitled to be heirs of the decedents and holding that I am on that statute that is final and conclusive for then in Section 373 of that Act, they gave the power authority to the Indian to make a will if he is 21 years of age pursuant to the regulations proscribed by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.271" offset="14724472">And then it was not valid unless and until it was approved by the Secretary of the Interior and then it could be approved or disapproved by and after the death of the Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.737" offset="14758327">And normally that's the way we handle those matters down there -- they wait after the Indian dies and then his will is submitted to the Examiner of Inheritance and hears a hearing on this, and determine whether or not the Indian was competent to make the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.969" offset="14811199">And whether or not the will itself complied with all the statutory or the requirements made under the rules promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.334" offset="14848711">Now, once having done that, then he determines whether or not there are any other causes by which reason by which he might say, well, I don't this will is fair and equitable because it didn't take care of the decedents or testator's heirs themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.133" offset="14915897">Now, Ms. Dorita High Horse, it is true that she didn't live with her father who was George Chahsenah but the trial court or that is the Examiner of Inheritance found that she was the illegitimate child of George Chahsenah and that she didn't get any benefits from his estate and he didn't provide for all her during that period of time and even that she became of age then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.430" offset="15021119">Now he made six wills down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.026" offset="15031463">And I want to say to the Court here that I'm fairly familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.091" offset="15047764">The first will he made, he made and left the beneficiary this Viola Atewooftakewa which is her name and she was married to man by the name of James Tate who was also Comanche Indian.</text>
