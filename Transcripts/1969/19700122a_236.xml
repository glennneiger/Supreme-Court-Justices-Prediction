            <label>Mr. Robert F. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="36.717" offset="250232">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.272" offset="268413">It is not without some regret that the State of Maryland arises this morning as the appellant in this case because we are not without sympathy for the plight in which the appellees have found themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.910" offset="327032">They are citizens of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.437" offset="341138">They reside within the geographical boundaries of the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.238" offset="364335">They pay certain taxes to the State of Maryland and most understandably, they are desirous of having the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.789" offset="398503">I might also say that where there’s a matter of personal discretion, for the Attorney General of Maryland before the Governor of Maryland with whom I have discussed this, we, out of sympathy will extend that right to vote to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.241" offset="460361">But we also submit to the Court, that in a government of laws and not of men, that this question is one that should not and cannot be decided out of sympathy for the plaintiffs or the appellees’ position but it is a question to which the laws of the United States, the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Maryland must be applied and a decision rendered after consideration of those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.411" offset="588988">I further suggest to the Court that the opinion of the District Court below, a District Court which we believe is one of the finest District Courts in the United States, notwithstanding its occasional err as in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.405" offset="653040">That the opinion of the District Court below was decided from an overabundance of sympathy for the plaintiffs and that that opinion, we respectfully submit is mistaken in fact and erroneous in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.824" offset="730676">At the outset, let me state that appellants and appellees alike concede that the land in question here is that over which the Government of the United States has exclusive legislative jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.334" offset="792743">It was not the policy of the State of Maryland in ceding jurisdiction to the federal government on any of the many federal reservations scattered throughout our state to reserve to ourselves concurrent jurisdiction, except that reservation which has become almost standard, the reservation as to serving process.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.961" offset="895248">The question as to whether or not a resident of a federal enclave over which the United States exercised exclusive legislative jurisdiction, whether those individuals were entitled to vote was considered by the Court of Appeals of Maryland as recently as 1963 when some residents of the Perry Point Naval Hospital in Cecil County in Maryland applied for the right to register, were refused that right and appealed to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.909" offset="1035055">In the Court of Appeals decision in that case, Royer versus the Board of Election Supervisors, the Maryland Court of Appeals, carefully considered the long line of cases in which the courts throughout this nation have considered this same question and after consideration of those cases and after review of what we believe to be the pertinent federal law on this question concluded that these individuals residing on these reservations were not in fact residents of the state of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.111" offset="1171832">It appears to us from our study of the law that dating from almost -- from 1811 down to as recently as six months ago in New Mexico, the courts throughout the United States have held that persons residing on federal reservations over which there is exclusive legislative jurisdiction vested in the Congress by virtue of Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution, those persons are not residents of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.060" offset="1303594">They are not -- do not have the same political right as to the residents of the state which surrounds them and that the sovereignty and the authority and the dominion of those states, of the state surrounding these reservations does not exist over the individuals residing therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.393" offset="1392933">In this long line of cases considered by the courts throughout the country, there are but three representing a minority view or there were but three representing a minority view until the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.678" offset="1454059">Two of those three are not really applicable to the case at hand because one of those involved a state which had reserved to itself concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.931" offset="1507140">Another involved a state which -- a state statute and only one, the decision of the -- an Intermediate Court of Appeals in California followed the line of reasoning which was adopted by the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.098" offset="1583731">May it please the Court, the arguments which we present today would appear to be, the first arguments addressed to this Court on this specific question, on the question of whether or not the residents of these enclaves must be granted the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.409" offset="1665024">But the question itself is not a question of first impression to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.186" offset="1688116">It is not a question of which this Court has not taken notice on prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.051" offset="1711626">Because the Court in surplus trading in 1930, in holding that certain blankets in the hands of a traitor on the federal reservation were not subject to state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.221" offset="1760214">This Court, set out at great length in this opinion and adopted, we believe the language of some of the state courts which had held and quoted the language of the state courts which had held that the residents of these federal enclaves were not entitled to vote, to be treated for voting purposes like the citizens of the states surrounding them.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.275" offset="1864495">The District Court decision from which we have appealed starts out by restating the premise that where the United States exercises this exclusive legislative jurisdiction over land within the state that the persons residing thereon are not, are not residents and need not be granted the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.805" offset="1962611">Then having, we believe, correctly stated the law, the Court goes on to examine the so-called retrocession statutes, various statutes by which the Congress of the United States, from 1928 on, has purportedly retroceded to the states certain jurisdiction over the inhabitants of these reservations and the Court after review of these statutes then concludes that the United States in fact having retroceded its jurisdiction in what it says is all or substantially all of the important matters of state sovereignty and authority that this jurisdiction is not exclusively federal but is concurrent between the state and the federal government and it being concurrent to state, the District Court said is required to extend that most precious right of all, it says the right to vote to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.448" offset="2221119">We submit, Your Honor, first of all that an examination of these retrocession statutes will quickly reveal that they do not retrocede to the State of Maryland or to any other state the all or substantially all of the state sovereignty over these areas nor do they give to the state concurrent jurisdiction with the federal government in the important areas of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.851" offset="2334804">What do they do, quickly stated, one extends to the residents of these enclaves, the benefits and the detriments of the State of Maryland’s wrongful death statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.283" offset="2376495">Another extends to them the benefits and the detriments of our workmen's compensation laws and of our unemployment insurance laws, the two that seem to be a third dealt with the right of the state to tax the lessee’s interest in commercial properties, rented by the Government to entrepreneurs within the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.039" offset="2471476">The two retrocession statutes that were --</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="594.787" offset="2482552">How about state income and sales and gasoline taxes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="598.690" stopTime="830.864">
            <label>Mr. Robert F. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="598.690" offset="2498121">I was just about to say, Mr. Justice Marshall that two that were of most interest to the District Court were the Buck Act and the Lee Act which gave to the states the right to exact income and sales taxes, that's the Buck Act and the Lea Act which gave to the states the right to levy taxes on motor fuel sold in the enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.876" offset="2586833">These obviously were of great interest to the District Court and I submit to Your Honors, it is because of the application of the Buck Act and the application of the Lea Act that the District Court reached its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.234" offset="2652348">The Buck Act gave to the State of Maryland the right to levy certain taxes on the residents of these enclaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.383" offset="2696861">It gave the state the right to levy income taxes and it gave the state the right to levy sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.889" offset="2734895">Further, the District Court noted that although the State of Maryland has absolutely no jurisdiction of any kind to try one situated in a federal reservation for any crime, any criminal violation of the state law, the District Court noted that the Congress had enacted as long ago as 1825 the Assimilative Crimes Act and the Court says then, this substantially means that the state criminal laws are enforced on the reservation and it was really because of these, because we exact income and sales taxes and because of the Assimilative Crimes Act that I believe the District Court found that we had all or substantially all of the sovereignty over these individuals as we do our residents of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.387" offset="2932903">And it is in this, Mr. Justice Marshall that we say that the Court has been mistaken in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.642" offset="2977938">First of all, I think this Court can take judicial notice of the fact that the income taxes and the sales taxes of any state are levied for the purpose of providing the moneys which are used for such public projects as highways, schools, colleges, libraries and we believe that enacting the Buck Act, giving us the right to impose sales and income taxes on these residents, the Congress of the United States was merely saying to the State of Maryland and to the other states that we recognize that these individuals who were employed by us within the geographical borders of your states are utilizing certain state services and we recognize the inequity of your proving these services for them without any return on your part and so we believe, Your Honors, that the passage of the Buck Act was merely an exercise in congressional equity giving to the state that which the state was already entitled from the services which we supply to the appellees and I might also point out, as the District Court did not, that when the Congress of the United States enacted the Buck Act, they appended to that Act a phrase which said, that nothing contained herein shall be held to have surrendered the exclusive legislative jurisdiction that the Congress of the United States exercises under Article I, Section 8 over the lands here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.459" offset="3385240">I believe that this, may it please the Court, is strongly persuasive of the fact that the District Court erred when it held to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.646" offset="3737997">We can do absolutely nothing on this reservation and that's the interest, the state interest in this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.446" offset="10785207">Mr. Chief Justice, the issue that I would like to press home here is that that is not the point that we are making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.472" offset="10821256">The State of Maryland retains the full power to define residents in terms of the bona fides of a particular persons living in a particular locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.706" offset="10886248">In the case of an Annapolis for example, the State of Maryland could perfectly well hold that a midshipman entering the academy for four years is not a bona fide resident of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.464" offset="10941210">However, a member of the faculty who plans to spend his entire life there and lives on the enclave should be considered a permanent resident of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.230" offset="10984260">The same is true at Fort Meade, somebody who is there on a temporary tour of duty can very well be denied his right to vote but somebody who again is there, as part of the permanent cadre should have a right to vote in the state of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.686" offset="11042147">So the distinction can still be made, the issue that is raised here is whether a person living in a particular locality and planning to live there for the rest of his life should be deprived forever of his right to vote as long as he chooses to live at that particular locality even though he is paying taxes to the state and is as the court below pointed out also subject to the criminal laws of the state through the Assimilative Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.506" offset="11165445">The only issue, the only point of distinction as I have mentioned before is the point of distinction with regard to the enforcement of the criminal laws and to return to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, I would say that if the state were to provide that residents of the enclaves may not vote for a state’s attorney Montgomery Count, I would say that there would be a rational reason for depriving them of that right to vote because a state's attorney of Montgomery County does indeed have no jurisdiction over the enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.741" offset="11298356">But every other officer of government for whom these residents may not vote under the theory of the other state, is a person in whom, in whose services have a vital interest.</text>
