            <text syncTime="22.020" offset="87980">We have done -- have researched and we have found what I suspect some members of the Court may already have known there is in fact a savings statute in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.572" offset="126224">There is indeed a constitutional provision that says that law shall not have retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.096" offset="152346">The -- upon my quote from the typical case and there are number of cases that make very clear that in our case the -- Mrs. Sanks and Mrs. Momman will be subjected double damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.750" offset="202919">But a typical case language and the typical case says, law as proscribe for the future unless a statute either expressly or by necessary implication, that’s language that used throughout the cases, shows that the general assembly intended that it operate retroactively it will be given only prospective applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.117" offset="340428">The statutory provision is the Constitution which is part of the Georgia Code and as cited this Georgia Code annotated 2-302.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.328" offset="389224">The statutory provision that says laws proscribe only for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.559" offset="410227">They cannot impair the obligation of contracts nor usually have a retrospective application is Georgia Code annotated 102-104.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.456" offset="453799">The closest case we were able to find for this -- on this issue is the case of Leathers v. Turner 75 Georgia Appeals 62, that’s a 1947 case and it involved the new NIL that was enacted in Georgia at that time and the debtor in that case was attempting to have his rights determine under the old Act and the court said that only -- and the creditor was asserting that his rights would appear under the new Act and the court decided for the debtor and said, only when there is very express language in the new statute that says that the rights created under the new statue replaced the rights under the old Act only with such express language does the new Act apply and there is no express language in this case in the new Georgia statute, the rights of the debtor -- of Mrs. Sanks will be determined by the old statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael D. Padnos</label>
            <text syncTime="167.675" offset="670616">That case is page 62, 75 Georgia Appeals 62, it’s a 1947 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.170" offset="708650">I might say in further reference to mootness since I know how much that concerns the Court that that raises a very interesting side issue that again I haven’t thought of and your question stimulated our thinking about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.959" offset="767791">If 305 is clearly applicable in this case and I think I feel it was persuaded that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.075" offset="800287">The 305 is clearly applicable, it’s very interesting what happened, should this Court decide that 305 is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.199" offset="824738">If you decide the 305 is constitutional or let’s just present that, the case goes back down presumably because the substance of issues haven’t been raised yet and at that point under 305, the landlord will be entitled to a double rent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.735" offset="890880">The only way the tenant will be able to do anything about the double rent judgment is if she goes in under 303 assuming that you will not decide 303 or decide adversely or she will have to go in under 303 and post the double-rent bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.960" offset="959739">When I talked yesterday, I was fairly certain that 303 was not applicable in this case, I think that’s been kind of opened up by your questionings.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.783" offset="995056">So, I think the 303, if you hold 305 constitutional, we’re going to be stuck with 303 as well and I think the point that makes is that what you’re faced with and what we’ve dealing with is the whole statutory scheme of 303 and 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.735" offset="1054929">And I think they really can’t be separated, one must be understood even in this narrow case is this, they must be understood together.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.132" offset="2416431">I will have very few things to say about mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.122" offset="2428447">Quite candidly, I would much prefer a decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.703" offset="2442762">I felt it was my obligation in light of the change of statute to present the question to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.618" offset="2466377">I, frankly, am uncertain as to whether there is mootness or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.917" offset="2479647">I recognize of course the reason the case is here to test the constitutionality of two statutes that is I suppose realistically speaking moot is to whether there is mootness as to the particular appellants, I am uncertain.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alfred L. Evans, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="646.384" offset="2585496">Because sir there is a great deal of confusion in this entire area right now and I do feel that very likely a decision in this case could give guidelines which would undoubtedly spill over into the stress warrants which are now under attack in Georgia and many other instances where due process issues are and equal protection issues are being raised in connection with pecuniary requirements generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.874" offset="2695419">I suppose I'm looking at a little bit from the viewpoint of the Georgia taxpayer, I started out, I anticipate I won about 10 of these cases on technicalities in the Georgia courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.392" offset="2737528">I finally came to the conclusion that I didn’t think I was doing the best service possible that it came up over and over again which should have adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.575" offset="2770233">Therefore, in this case I waived, I didn’t raise questions of the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.452" offset="2793744">I left that go by I didn’t raise any issue other than the merits because I want to do adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.445" offset="2873678">I fully understand the jurisdictional problems sir, but I was just indicating my own feelings why I raised the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.521" offset="2901995">I might say that what would happen if it went back is also a picture of total confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.816" offset="2919236">In fact, the statute has not been followed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.802" offset="2931148">In fact the rents have been paid into the registry of court which is strictly contrary to statute, how this would affect the double rent, I have no way of ascertaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.127" offset="2972421">I am in a somewhat unusual position in arguing in support of the statute which I held to have repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.266" offset="3001051">But while the position is unusual, it does not present a conflict, I work for the new law not because I thought the old one was unconstitutional but because I thought we could perhaps do a little bit better.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.808" offset="3051207">Good, better or best, of course do not raise constitutional issues and while the nebulous nature of equal protection and due process surely must provide a string temptation to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.451" offset="3105750">This Court has repeatedly said that it does not seat to second guess legislatures as to whether their solution to a particular problem is the wisest or best of the available alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.022" offset="3160085">Now, the problem presented to the legislature in this particular situation is a very difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.848" offset="3183386">It goes to the heart of the landlord-tenant relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.507" offset="3198015">How do you handle the problem of a tenant who wants to possess another’s property to which he may well have no right at all while he litigates his claims?</text>
            <text syncTime="810.163" offset="3240647">If you allow the tenant to posses the property, how do you protect the landlord from irreparable injury in the event of the tenant’s possession was in fact wrongful?</text>
            <text syncTime="822.574" offset="3290279">In as much as the landlord-tenant relationship is contractual, the answer may some times be found in the contract itself but what if the contract is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.217" offset="3340852">Over 140 years ago, the general assembly of Georgia hit upon one solution to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.664" offset="3366557">It decided that one reasonable way of protecting the landlord’s interest and still allowing the tenant to remain in possession would be to require the tenant to post bond as a condition of continued possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.898" offset="3427579">Statutes dealing with the subject matter of a contract, of course, are traditionally deemed to be incorporated into and made a part of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.797" offset="3471151">For this reason, it has been understood in the State of Georgia for over 140 years that if there is no stipulation to the contrary, the landlord is entitled to rely upon the state’s statutory dispossession procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.125" offset="3532487">I wish to emphasize at the very outset that the statutory procedure which appellant’s attack is a procedure which they in fact contractually agreed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.644" offset="3574491">I think the case could well be decided on this point without even reaching the constitutional issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.363" offset="3605420">Now in their brief, appellants attack Georgia’s dispossession procedures under both the equal protection and due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.181" offset="3652650">While Mr. Padnos indicated yesterday that he was less intrigued currently by equal protection and due process, I do not understand that he has wholly abandoned equal protection and therefore I feel I must comment upon both.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.748" offset="3714926">It is true of course that these two provisions often overlap, but they are not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.814" offset="3739167">Because I believe that the questions raised under each of the two clauses are quite different in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.773" offset="3762991">I would proceed to discuss them separately rather than together.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.202" offset="3784725">Looking first at equal protection, I think it is rather obvious that to have an intelligent or I dare say even intelligible conversation on equal protection; one must first define what sort of equality one is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.014" offset="3848046">There are two types of equality, the first is equality of treatment, the second is equality of result.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.994" offset="3875944">The distinction is quite critical for the simple reason that the existence of one almost always negates the existence of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.933" offset="3911680">To illustrate the incompatibility, I might refer to tuition charges as state university.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.313" offset="3937176">Ordinarily, the fee is uniform at least for all state residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.798" offset="3959118">This is equality of treatment, all students are treated alike, yet this very equality of treatment clearly produces an inequality of result respecting the ability of indigent and affluent students to enroll in the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.030" offset="4032052">If on the other hand, the word “indigent” could somehow be classified and students falling within the classification were permitted to attend the university tuition free, there would obviously be at least a movement toward equality of result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.502" offset="4101956">This would require of course a total absence of equality of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.705" offset="4122749">I suppose what would follow would be suits progressively by students just outside the classification of indigency until ultimately may be everyone will go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.441" offset="4165695">For reasons which ought to be obvious, it is equality of treatment rather than equality of result which prevails in the legislatures and in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.963" offset="4207804">We see this in public utility charges, public transportation and admission fees and charges for public accommodations generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.905" offset="4243540">These fees do not show very according to the pocketbook of the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.245" offset="4264960">Sales, taxes, excise taxes and automobile license plates fall upon rich and poor alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.779" offset="4291082">Theft is not excusable because the thief is indigent and therefore has -- is under a greater pressure to steal than the person of means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.583" offset="4326296">And as we think we show in our brief the authorities to date are rather uniform in holding that the great number of bonds both in the federal system and state system which are required in some situations as a condition of holding office and other situations as a condition of access to courts are not to be pushed aside or enforced according to the economic means of the person require to post the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.902" offset="4435592">It is this traditional test which the Supreme Court of Georgia applied in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.336" offset="4461296">Having adopted the equality of treatment view of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Georgia Supreme Court could hardly have concluded other then that there was simply no classification based upon economic means which existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.285" offset="4521064">The sole classification which did exist was that of being a tenant which like that of being a student has nothing to do with economic status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.227" offset="4564846">Since this test negates the existence of the indigency classification upon which appellants chiefly rely in their equal protection argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.037" offset="4608104">We feel they simply have no equal protection argument at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.300" offset="4625136">The result of course would be different if this Court were to construe the Fourteenth Amendment as requiring equality of results rather than of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.594" offset="4662335">If equality result is the constitutional goal, they will have to be inequality of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.205" offset="4684800">Under this approach, the Constitution would presumably require a sliding scale for bonds, bail, tuition and all other fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.629" offset="4718446">In each instance, the individual’s economic means would have to be very carefully scrutinized to achieve as equal a result as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.221" offset="4756793">Carried to its natural conclusion, I suppose that the equality result test would require the leveling of all differences attributable to economic circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.619" offset="4802456">If not from each according to his ability, we would at least have two each according to his needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.109" offset="4828369">I think it is not surprising that the courts like the legislatures have been reluctant to so convert the Equal Protection Clause into a socialist manifesto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.457" offset="4869747">The equality of result approaches have been very sparingly used by the legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.387" offset="4893466">One example might be progressive income tax; another, various welfare programs and some educational programs which are specifically designed to alleviate the condition of the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.323" offset="4945189">Inarguably judicial example would be this Court’s line of cases starting in Griffin versus Illinois which hold that indigent prisoners must be given the same appellate remedies as are given to those prisoners who are not indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.494" offset="5001927">I say arguably because quite candidly I really believe that the underlying rational of these cases is not equal protection, but it is due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.046" offset="5040170">While the difficulties of the equality of result approach is that it would require highly subjective and personal evaluations which defines upon distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.772" offset="5083011">This is not of course true of the equality treatment approach which is a traditional approach, which is acceptable of an objective judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.749" offset="5562932">This Court has said that it is not merely the subjective view of the justices on this Court which should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.864" offset="5595429">If one looks for objective standards, is it not highly relevant that the statutory procedure in question has been in effect and very greatly relied upon in Georgia for over 140 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.989" offset="5675886">I think if we are to fairly judge the essential fairness of Georgia’s dispossessory procedures, we must look at these procedures in the light of history and also in the light of the totality of the landlord tenant relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.258" offset="5752999">As we point out in our brief, the common law situation was basically one of self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.000" offset="5775987">The landlord was ordinarily permitted to use such force as was necessary to physically remove the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.224" offset="5808797">This was obviously harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.973" offset="5823843">This is not to say, of course, that the tenant was without remedy for a wrongful eviction of common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.202" offset="5848712">He could sue for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.821" offset="5859265">He could bring an action in tort for wrongful eviction where he had the possibility of recovering punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.456" offset="5885806">He also could secure equitable relief in a proper case involving fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.176" offset="5904614">I hasten to add that indigency alone would not give the court equitable jurisdiction but it could have equitable jurisdiction, it could enjoy the eviction if there were other equitable grounds available such as fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.087" offset="5976294">Now, in past arguments, appellants have conceded that Georgia could retain the common law situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.967" offset="6015791">This being so are not appellants in a rather strange position to be attacking a statutory procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.189" offset="6048705">The principle aim in effect of which has been to alleviate the condition of the tenant to improve his condition over that which he had at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.653" offset="6090606">In addition to retaining all of his common law remedies, the tenant gained a very valuable albeit qualified right of retaining possession of someone else’s property during litigation as to whether he had any rights to the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.371" offset="6153404">Moreover, the tenant was spared the self-help injuries inflicted by the landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.531" offset="6178064">The statutory procedure terminated this valuable right of the landlord to use such force as was necessary to eject the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.701" offset="6222785">The heart of appellants’ due process claim of course is that now this qualification to the statutory right they gained must also be eliminated for reason that it forecloses them from access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.751" offset="6294988">We emphatically deny that appellants are foreclosed from asserting their claimed rights by the bond posting requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.606" offset="6326335">To start with, appellants whether or not they post bond retain all of their common law remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.877" offset="6355487">They can still sue for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.242" offset="6364891">They can still bring an action in tort for wrongful eviction where they can get punitive damages and in a proper case, they can secure injunctive relief which could restrain eviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.977" offset="6407837">Additionally, there is a question of whether there is a denial of access such as would shock the conscience where the principle argument is the indigency of the particular persons involved as this Court said in OMB versus Morgan the question of whether a security condition is reasonable depends upon its general effect and operation not upon instances of peculiar hardship arising out of exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.552" offset="6538136">In OMB which Snyder Act very recently treated as being constitutionally viable, the contention was not at all unlike the contention made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.286" offset="6581081">There, a defendant in a foreign attachment action had its pleading stricken when he was unable to furnish security in the sum of $200,000.00 a rather substantial sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.588" offset="6630296">It was contended that this denial of his right to appear and present his defenses was a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.897" offset="6663523">This Court disagreed saying that the statute expressly gave him an opportunity to appear and that the security condition did not as a matter of law take away his right not withstanding the fact that he attempted to but was unable to obtain the security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.698" offset="6738756">This Court in cases as Union Guano and also in Cohen versus Beneficial Loan has consistently held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent the State from proscribing reasonable and appropriate conditions to the seeking of judicial relief in specific situations so long as first, the basis of the distinction is real and second, a legitimate governmental end is served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.270" offset="6848993">Certainly, the situation here is specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.693" offset="6862681">It involves purely possessory rights in only three specific situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.144" offset="6892565">They are, where the tenant has failed to pay rent, where the tenant is holding over beyond the term of the lease, and where the tenant occupies at will or by sufferance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.332" offset="6937287">As the Supreme Court of Georgia, correctly I think noted, these are facts which are or ought to be easily within the knowledge of the tenant as well as within the knowledge of the landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.882" offset="7003429">We think it is equally clear that the basis of the distinction is real.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.791" offset="7023073">The interest involved here are for a cry from those presented in the line of cases such as Griffin ver -- starting with Griffin versus Illinois or Goldberg versus Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.919" offset="7075631">In both of those cases, the balancing involved was the balancing of the rights of individuals versus an interest in state funds -- safeguarding state funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.035" offset="7136131">Under the circumstances presented in those cases which were spelled out very carefully, this Court opted in favor of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.409" offset="7173538">This is not a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.230" offset="7180852">The interests here are not State versus an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.378" offset="7193496">Here, it is the clash of economic interests between two easily identifiable classes of private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.345" offset="7229336">On the one hand, you have the, admit and we don’t deny the hardship of dispossession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.377" offset="7257443">There is he admitted personal hardship of dispossession on one hand although this is a hardship which if wrongfully inflicted ought to be and is compensable by damages including in a tort action punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.312" offset="7321182">On the other hand, you have the danger of irreparable injury to the landlord through lost rental income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.605" offset="7354410">In most cases, this lost could never be recovered particularly whereas here the tenants are indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.627" offset="7386488">This question is to whether they would be liable for double damages on if it should go back, it’s really an academic question, they’re indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.800" offset="7427135">The landlord will never get initial damages much less double damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.925" offset="7451690">I simply can’t understand how this can be said not to be a very real basis of distinction where you’re weighing the interest of two competing groups of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.404" offset="7497561">Finally, we submit that protection of property from irreparable loss is a legitimate and indeed a compelling governmental objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.103" offset="7544372">Under the Georgia Constitution, I think under the Constitution of most states, protection of person and property is one of the fundamental justifications for the very existence of any government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.875" offset="7599438">For over 140 years, the general assembly of Georgia has accorded a very high degree of protection to the owners of property including the owners of rental property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.296" offset="7645100">Through the bond posting requirement of its dispossessory proceedings, it is in the absence of the stipulation to the contrary a part of the lease to which every tenant agrees he can vary it by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.613" offset="7710407">If standards for shocking the conscience are truly objective, I fail to see how after 140 years this statute is suddenly in this category of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.048" offset="7768189">Frankly, which at my conscience if the state could not protect the owners of rental property.</text>
