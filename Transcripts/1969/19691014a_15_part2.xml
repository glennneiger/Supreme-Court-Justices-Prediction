            <text syncTime="1370.411" offset="5585063">So far as other jurisdictions which or other people which feel that a jury trial should not be had, there are of course 34 states which do not provide for a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.731" offset="5858304">Really, one other problem that you have in connection with a jury trial for a juvenile court, in a juvenile court, is the matter of finding a jury of peers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.550" offset="6397576">The National Council of Juvenile Court Judges appears today as amicus to support the contention of the appellee with the Sixth Amendment as incorporated through the Fourteenth, does not require a jury trial in juvenile adjudications of delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.022" offset="6467480">And secondly, to support its claim that the transfer or the exercise of the prosecutor's discretion to try a child as a juvenile rather than to accuse him as a criminal violated no requirement of due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.753" offset="6534353">No Mr. Justice Stewart, we do not for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.167" offset="6556087">Frankly in this area at least, it seems to me the quantum of proof formula become more semantic than ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.952" offset="6587225">Most juvenile court judges I'd to say as Dean Paulson points out, are not going to find the child guilty of the act of which he's accused, unless he is really convinced the boy did the act and I think -- I don't think it is a matter of great moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.656" offset="6638007">If this Court decides that the Sixth Amendment through the Fourteenth requires a jury trial it would seem to me quite obvious that you would follow it with the reasonable doubts standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.645" offset="6681997">But if the Court -- I can see the Court being troubled by the actual adjudication of delinquency in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.131" offset="6715852">A subsequent Nebraska case to which we refer in our brief Guy versus Bishop at page 8, in our view at least and in the view of the dissenting judge there, seem that the parts somewhat from the stricter preponderance of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.302" offset="6772590">Now, it is possible if the Nebraska court got another look at that particular issue in this case, it might reach a different result that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.235" offset="6804355">Unfortunately, the appellant elected to come to habeas corpus route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.460" offset="6825253">He has chose to bring the direct appeal or it would have had a trial de novo in the District Court, and then again at -- I was amazed to find in the Nebraska that Supreme Court has rather broad powers in civil cases on the equity side in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.957" offset="6891186">So, that the sufficiency of the evidence question as I read this record was never squarely presented to the Nebraska Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.542" offset="6921592">I would think since four judges went for him among the constitutional grounds he probably would have won the case if he went that way, but I don't know what the Nebraska Supreme Court would do if it went back in that posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.015" offset="6979480">Maybe they, in Nebraska like most states you can't use habeas corpus as a substitute for appeal, I don't know what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.300" offset="7012603">I suppose it much would depend if there was a mandate from this Court on the particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.029" offset="7031515">So for those reasons, we have not taken up the standard of proof point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.719" offset="8414229">The fact that the Nebraska Supreme Court didn't consider it, You Honor I think it's easily explained by the fact that it's never presented to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.645" offset="8709935">It seems to me the answer to the equal protection objection is that the decisions of this Court show that children can be treated differently from adults with respect to the application of the constitutional rights if it's for their benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.639" offset="9681899">In that case, it would seem to me that the responsibility would have to fall on the juvenile's lawyer, who after all, is the lawyer for the juvenile, not for the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.012" offset="9727457">I mean, if the lawyer sees a conflict of interest between juvenile and the parent, he's got to go with the juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.033" offset="9771551">Now, if he is retained counsel and being paid by the parents to defend the child, there can be problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.064" offset="9799659">On the other hand in that case, if they're paying the lawyer to defend the child, they probably want the child to be defended and therefore there wouldn't be the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.145" offset="9843963">The conflict could arise in the case of appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.716" offset="9862248">I could see where the parents would come in and say “We don't want this child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2506.564" offset="10129638">As I said, we dispose of them by pleas of guilty and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.362" offset="10152835">On this business of court's convenience and court administration, if the lawyers of Nebraska stop pleading people guilty, the system would seize function without many more judges, many more court houses and many more juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.739" offset="10214379">The criminal justice system in this country today, of course, functions on negotiation and I can't see any real marked differences between the adult criminals system and the juvenile system because the end result can be very much the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.546" offset="10461602">So, I don't think it makes any substantial difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.990" offset="10475290">It's just that on the basis of a hearing with no statutory standard at the pleasure of Board of Pardons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.908" offset="10507055">The end result of the juvenile court process can be after an adjudication of delinquency can be confinement in a penal institution, whether it'd be call the Morris Training School or the Man's Reformatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.954" offset="10575182">I think, it's basically a distinction without a difference, but as I say here is a boy in an adult penal institution with people who got there with constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2668.118" offset="10775803">And again, I think, I think that's a decision that the lawyer makes, one of the first things that you do when you -- are defending an adult.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.597" offset="10849782">You may not feel quite that way about a juvenile because you might feel of his need for treatment and as his guardian ad litem you might be a little more inclined to involve of yourself in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.709" offset="10902235">I mean, if an adult criminal defendant says “I want a jury”, why, he has one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.623" offset="10917909">You don't want to attempt to talk to him out of it, because every time you plead the man guilty, you're running a risk of an accusation and confidence when he gets incarcerated and things don't took go well.</text>
