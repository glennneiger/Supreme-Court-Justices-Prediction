            <label>Mr. Richard G. Kleindienst</label>
            <text syncTime="31.691" offset="230170">This case comes of the Court on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.707" offset="250232">It raises a specific but in the opinion of the Government a very important issue as to the administration of the National Labor Relations Act and it presents the precise question of whether on the eve up or at other about the time of a representation of election under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.959" offset="327241">The employer engages in unfair labor practice activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.298" offset="348557">Whether such unfair labor practice activity is rendered moot and therefore now susceptible to an enforcing order from the Court of Appeals by virtue of a subsequent representation election which the union lost that came after the unfair labor practice activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.155" offset="443956">The facts in the case, I think are likewise rather direct and not controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.377" offset="468929">The union in the case began its organizational activities among the employees in the fall of 1964 on the eve of the representation election a few days before representatives of the company engaged in conduct which subsequently as I will outline was determined to be in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.844" offset="558791">And election was held, the union lost the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.207" offset="572165">The union petition to have the election set aside and at the same time, filed unfair labor practice, filed a complaint with the Board and the charge with the Board, and the Board subsequently filed this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.323" offset="636635">Thereafter, the Board heard the evidence with the respect to alleged unfair labor practice activity and issued its order against the employer to the cease-and-desist in the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.672" offset="690030">Following the order of the Board, a second election was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.757" offset="706435">Again, which the union lost, and that election was set aside for reasons that are not material here and do not appear in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.039" offset="743528">After the second election, the Board petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for an order in forcing its order against the respondent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.628" offset="785847">And after that petition to the Court of Appeals, a third election was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.239" offset="812283">And again, the union lost the election but at this time, there was no objections filed by the union or the employees with respect to the conduct of the election, and the Board certified the election as be invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.304" offset="956583">I don't believe that that's material one way or another to the determination of this issue, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.386" offset="980929">Well, if their votes -- if their total ballot decreased as each election went on it might suggest some relationship between the companies the continuing impact, the continuing effect of the companies at a union activities would it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="243.208" offset="1076224">Possibly but there's so many other factors that could occur, turnover employees, other conduct the issues raised in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.202" offset="1108198">I would say that you almost have to have precise evidence so the point like that Mr. Chief Justice before that would be a supportable inference all by itself from just a mere of fact if the votes went up or down, one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.342" offset="1156786">Now, that would be my opinion in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.518" offset="1173400">When the case --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="268.000" offset="1175385">Does the record show -- since you are already been interrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.256" offset="1192417">Before you resume, there's a record other reasons of the second elections was set aside?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_g_kleindienst" startTime="276.389" stopTime="302.342">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Kleindienst</label>
            <text syncTime="276.389" offset="1208926">No, and I don't believe that any inference can be gained from this record as to the fact that it was set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.076" offset="1239646">There's nothing with the record, and I think it would be improper for the Government to suggest inferentially or otherwise or that that second election was set aside as a result of misconduct on the part of the respondent company, and the record doesn't show it is Mr. Justice Stewart and I don't want to infer that it was a continuation as an improper conduct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Kleindienst</label>
            <text syncTime="302.930" offset="1315088">In the part of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.755" offset="1322402">Now, when the matter got to the Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit, the respondent company brought to the attention of the Court to the fact that a valid subsequent election that been held and asked the Court to dismiss all of the proceedings involved in the matter, and asked it to rely from its decision in the General Engineering case of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.404" offset="1412995">The Court in a per curiam decision did deny the respondent company's motion to dismiss all the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.272" offset="1444446">And I think it's significant to point out here that they did not determine on the merits when it had before it, as a matter of fact, based upon the record considered as a whole and the law of whether in fact the respondent company was guilty of committing the unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.931" offset="1519052">They just saw the whole -- through the whole thing out on the grounds that the matter had become loop and no longer been an import as a result of the third subsequent valid election.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.997" offset="1575372">The Board petitioned for a certiorari raising three fundamental questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.713" offset="1598255">One, it present a very clear precise conflict between a decision of the Ninth Circuit on the one hand of the Second, Fourth and Seventh Circuits and almost identical cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.491" offset="1641305">The decision of the Ninth Circuit in the Raytheon, this case and General Engineering conflicts in the opinion of the Government with very clearly enunciated opinions of this Court dealing generally and broadly in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.618" offset="1693863">And then finally, it presented a good question of policy with respect to the effectuation of the policies in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.432" offset="1745063">The respondent's argument in the case seems to be essentially predicated upon the statement that since Section 10 (e) of the Act, confers upon the Court of Appeals to review decision of the National Labor Relations Board that that discretion is a broad one and that the Court below properly exercised this broad discretion in dismissing this case on the grounds of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.335" offset="1876720">Now, as preface to my argument and if the Court will grant me permission, I would like to direct the Court's attention to a case that was not cited in the Government's brief nor in briefs filed by the respondent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.198" offset="1936175">I called Mr. Resnick Monday when they case change of my attention and indicated my desire to do so, and I believe that he would say without objection that I made.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.292" offset="1976508">The reason why it was not cited, it's a decision of Mr. Justice Marshall which was written on December 15th of this term of the Court and it was handed down after the briefs on behalf of the Government were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.656" offset="2030007">And that's your case NRLB versus Rutter-Rex.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.692" offset="2046098">The reason why we file it is that the Supreme Court, this Court, very clearly and concisely set what it had set before and that is to say that the remedial powers of the National Labor Relations Board are broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.735" offset="2110360">It's a broad discretionary power and they are subject to but limited review.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.277" offset="2144528">And I think that this case -- this recent decision of this Court in the opinion of the Government is practically dispositive of the argument of the respondent company here.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.111" offset="2187786">Because the only way the respondent company can get to this point is to say that Section 10 (e) confers upon the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.107" offset="2219760">They brought very broad discretionary power in their review boarders of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.508" offset="2253406">The best example of that, I think is the decision of this Court in National Labor Relations Board versus Mexia Textile which was handed down by this Court in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.706" offset="2310248">In that case, the issue was whether not the Board could go to the Court of Appeals to enforce its order, even if the respondent employer had voluntarily complied with the order of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.067" offset="2359672">And the issue was raised to the Court of Appeals that there's no reason for you to consider this matter any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.118" offset="2383809">The Board said that we engaged in illegal activity in conduct, we agreed with it, we have complied with it, so why haven't order the Board enforcing conduct that we've already complied with or corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.616" offset="2429785">The Supreme Court and this Court, I think correctly held that since this kind of conduct can't be continuing in nature, the merely showing of compliance and voluntary or not by the employer with it and anyone given point of time, should not be a bar to the Board's right to get an enforcement order, so that it would have available to it, a contempt citation and order in the event the employer came along subsequent to its voluntary compliance and engaged in similar conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.173" offset="2556113">I think also whether the decision to Court which go to the whole question of mootness bring to bare the essential problem that's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.141" offset="2599894">As this Court has held and in the United States versus W.T. Grant Company, you should not dismiss a case on the grounds of mootness until only there's reasonable expectation that there will never be a reoccurrence of the wrong again, that there's a strong burden imposed upon the wrong doer to come forward and show that regardless of our intent or the circumstances that it's likely that the conduct would never occur again.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.209" offset="2716191">And I think again as this Court has held in Walling versus Reuter, this is true, so that the courts or the administrative boards and agencies can always have in its hit pockets so to speak the arrow to its bow of a contempt citation issued by a Court in the event the wrong doer commits the wrong again.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.017" offset="2811486">And then finally of course just from the stand point of public policy in the administration of the Act and I think at this point that Court should be primarily concerned about because if you take the respondents argument that at first blush, he would make the Court believe either way that there is something integral and indigenous about Section 8 of the Act leading with unfair labor practice conduct to the one end and Section 9 of the Act which deals with representation elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.365" offset="2952861">Section 7 of the Act guarantees to employees the right to engage in the concern of the activities for their mutual aid and protection, and I think that this guarantee of Section 7 of the Act encompasses several portions of the balance of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.624" offset="3017853">One of them of course is the representation election.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.051" offset="3031542">Employees under this act have a right to a free environment, the Board has set, I think many times that ask ideally under the laboratory conditions that the Board would like to see exist, to organize among themselves, to designate a union as their collective bargaining agent, to have representation election whereby such a bargain agent can be certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.524" offset="3149511">But this right that is conferred upon employees in terms to self-organization is a distinct separate right under the Act in terms of its policies then the provisions that are contained in Section 8 of the Act that deal with unfair labor practice activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.867" offset="3222862">One of the reasons why you have Section 8 of the Act is to give the Board and the courts a machinery by which you can create these so-called laboratory conditions, so that employees can make a free choice with respect to the selection of their collective bargain agent, and for the employer to come along as the respondent company has in this case to say the we'll really, they've had two or three shots to this election and they've lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.249" offset="3344384">And what we might have done with respect to the first one and it should be rendered moot, I think begs the question because all you have to do then is to permit employers to engaged in this kind of conduct and the union could have three or four, or five, or six elections and the courts would never really have a means by which to stop the yearly go activity in conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="832.181" offset="3432051">But you, Mr. Attorney General, you seem to agree that if a Court determined there is no really substantial chance of the conduct ever being repeated that it could be dismissed as a moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="996.746" offset="4090337">This new grievance procedure is a continuing procedure presumably although the record doesn't show, it exists today, so that as the case as all the courts held in Second, Fourth, and Seventh Circuits these unions might want to come back at some other time to attempt to organize the employees, they have the right indeed in this case the inference is strong if they would want to because they tried it three times already.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.846" offset="5762800">We don't seek any broad rule of mootness only that the exercise was appropriate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.821" offset="5790699">The question of whether Raytheon's conduct was protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution or Section 8 (c) of the Act is not before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.560" offset="5825599">Neither is the question of whether Raytheon's pre-election conduct did or did not constitute unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.908" offset="5854960">However, in order to decide the issue which is presented, some background of how the history of the case appeared to the Court of Appeals is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.937" offset="5899160">So, I'd like to go into fact a little more in detail than the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.295" offset="5920580">As the record stood before the Court of Appeals, Raytheon was an employer of approximately 40,000 people with plants in a number of locations throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.759" offset="5962376">Employees had a number of plants including two in California who are represented by unions, and there had never been a strike by Raytheon employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.917" offset="5999052">Approximately 19 petitions for election had been filed at Raytheon plants during the period between 1960 and 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.734" offset="6034265">And prior to the case before you, no objections had been filed to Raytheon pre-election conduct in any of those and of course no elections had been set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.611" offset="6073866">On January 4, 1965, the IUE filed a petition with the board for a representation election to be held in the unit of production maintenance employees at Raytheon's Mountain View, California plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.844" offset="6126738">Subsequently, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers expressed interest in the proceeding and then election was agreed upon for February 4, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.860" offset="6166862">On February 2, two days before the election, Robert Hennemuth, Raytheon's vice-president industrial relations delivered on address to eight groups of the employees, the speeches were substantially identical in conduct emphasizing the importance of voting, explaining how the collective bargaining process works, making a comparison of wages and fringe benefits with other Raytheon plants and with other companies, and requesting employee support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.417" offset="6285040">In his speeches and in response the question for the audience, Hennemuth repeatedly emphasized that the election was to be a free election and as he put it, “the good old American tradition”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.945" offset="6335195">He stated repeatedly that he could not and would not promise any benefits or make any threats or reprisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.131" offset="6359855">He pointed out that in a quote “We want to know, how any of you voted anyway, so don't worry about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.151" offset="6387963">The speeches were followed by question periods and which anyone which Hennemuth attempted to answer employee inquiries from the floor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.122" offset="6463822">About a week prior to the election, a Raytheon foreman named, Chris allegedly questioned one employee in the course of discussions regarding her transfer as to why she wanted the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.289" offset="6508544">Now, the Hennemuth speeches and the so-called Chris Alvarado conversations formed the sole basis for the board's subsequent unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.589" offset="6545742">The election was duly held on February 4, two days after the Hennemuth speeches and a majority of employees voted neither union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.914" offset="6579075">The IUE filed a petition to set aside the election in unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.934" offset="6599137">After hearing by the trial examiner, the boards set aside the election and found that Raytheon had committed certain unfair labor practices from which it was ordered to cease-and-desist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.274" offset="6640515">The board's findings were based as I said earlier upon alleged improprieties in the Hennemuth speeches and upon the conversation between the first line foreman and one employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.331" offset="6684714">A second election was conducted by the board on June 23, 1967 as the Attorney General has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.453" offset="6705194">It was subsequently set aside on grounds not apparent from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.991" offset="6723375">On February 8, 1968, the board petitioned to the Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit for enforcement of it unfair labor practice order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.438" offset="6757125">Subsequently, on November 1, 1968, while the board's petition for enforcement was pending, a third election was held, in which employees again rejected representation by the IUE and on November 12, the board's regional director certified the results of the third election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.586" offset="6833716">After the board filed its petition for enforcement, the IUE filed a petition in the same court to review the portion of the boards order dismissing the IUE's motion to amend the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.099" offset="6879796">Briefs on the merits in the court were filed on the Court of Appeals by all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.611" offset="6901844">At the oral argument at the Court of Appeals on January 7, the Board argued its petition for enforcement fully on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.772" offset="6934444">The IUE argued in support of the Board's petition fully on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.370" offset="6956805">Following these arguments, Raytheon's counsel called the attention of the Court to its prior decision in General Engineering and to the fact that a certified election had been held since the filing towards the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.982" offset="7011349">He then completed his argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.996" offset="7023365">The Court of Appeals agreed to consider on the basis of its earlier decision a motion to dismiss which Raytheon filed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles H. Resnick</label>
            <text syncTime="1776.429" offset="7209044">That's a good question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.225" offset="7216253">My brother tells me that in his research immediately prior to the oral argument, he went on to the General Engineering case and felt obligated to call it to the attention of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.406" offset="7260975">Otherwise, it probably would have been handled in a different manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.582" offset="7285739">The decision of the Court of Appeals in the case at bar necessarily requires a careful examination of the decision in General Engineering on which it is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.791" offset="7326490">That case arose, on of the petition by the board for enforcement of a broad order, encompassing pre-election conduct, reinstatement of two unlawfully discharged employees and reinstatement of the supervisor, found to have been discharged in violation of Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.838" offset="7398693">The Court did not dismiss the entire proceeding as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.463" offset="7413217">On the contrary, it considered in detail whether the discharge of the two employees violated Section 8 (a) (3) and whether the discharged of the supervisor violated Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.484" offset="7465357">Upon consideration, it granted in prior enforcement of the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.895" offset="7486986">As to the portion of the order dealing with the representation case only, the court held that the cease-and-desist order had been mooted by issuance of the certification of the results on the election held subsequent to the order on the review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.241" offset="7544351">On these facts, the rule of law could be derived from the decision of the court below and from its prior decision in General Engineering is that where alleged unfair labor practices relates solely to an election proceeding, the Court of Appeals may, don't have to, may dismiss a petition for enforcement of an order relating only to those practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.119" offset="7635884">Orders entered by the Board are not self-enforcing nor is the Board authorized to the levied fines or penalties for failure to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.448" offset="7669112">Congress did not grant this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.045" offset="7679561">Instead, Section 10 (e) of the Act provides that the board shall have the power to petition the Courts of Appeal for the enforcement of its order and that the Board shall file a record with the proceedings in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.951" offset="7723133">The Court of Appeals not the Board is then given the power to grant temporary relief and the power to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so a modified or setting aside in all or in part the order of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.643" offset="7785932">Congress had considered and rejected the possibility of placing more enforcement authority in the Board and less on the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.330" offset="7820727">The study of the legislative history of Section 10 (e) shows that such statute says the Packers and Stock Yards Act and the Interstate Commerce Act with their mandatory provisions for injunctive orders were considered before the adoption of Section 10 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.350" offset="7880808">Instead of following the provisions of those statutes, the draftsman followed the enforcement provisions of Section 11 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act which required the Board to seek enforcement from the Courts of Appeals, and the Courts of Appeals in turn were not required to but were given power to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.381" offset="7964923">As noted at page 10 of Raytheon's brief, a specific amendment by the House of Representatives was adopted at a late stage of the legislator proceeding to change the words that since what is now Section 10 (e) from “shall make and enter a decree, so as to read shall have the power to make and enter a decree”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.805" offset="8050604">It seems clear that Congress intended the order, the Court of Appeals to act not as rubberstamp for the Board's orders but to issue such orders as the Court of Appeals on evaluation of the case felt appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.933" offset="8103058">Necessarily included within that power was the power to dismiss Board petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.685" offset="8126151">As this Court said in Hecht versus Bowles, a grant of jurisdiction to issue compliance orders are hardly suggest an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.031" offset="8171499">The difference in language alone would distinguished this case from Wirtz versus Glass Blowers Association cited in the Attorney General's brief, there, as this Court obtains to point out, the labor management reporting in disclosure act of 1969, left no room for choice but required that the Court shall declare the election void and direct a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.126" offset="8267839">The Court of Appeals acted within the proper grounds -- bounds of discretion in this case, as its judgment discloses, the case had command to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.649" offset="8309948">On the basis of that record and the argument of counsel, it must have been clear to the Court that it was dealing in this least with a deep-rooted, hardcore offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.244" offset="8352371">On the contrary, it was dealing with inferences to be derived from speeches properly characterized by the trial examiner was made in “without ranker”, good humor give and take in a question period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.469" offset="8405243">The Court of Appeals put and did conclude that the offenses were so superficial and so intertwined with the election proceeding that enforcement was not justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.553" offset="8445576">Now, the Attorney General calls your attention properly to your decision in Rutter-Rex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.135" offset="8463862">The situation in Rutter-Rex was entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.520" offset="8477445">There the Court of Appeals was dealing with an employer whom have had already in an earlier case ordered to comply with the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.383" offset="8520913">It was the second time out when the Court of Appeals decided to modify the Board's order with respect to backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.142" offset="8551946">The case involved one of the most serious offenses under the Act and unfair labor practice strike in the obligation to reinstate with backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.004" offset="8583398">In reversing the court below, this Court discuss in detail the nature of backpay orders and the burden of whom -- who should bare the lost pay, the employee or the employer notwithstanding the Board's delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.139" offset="8643897">I submit that our case is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.418" offset="8657063">There is no backpay order. Only the initial consideration of whether an order for enforcement should issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.494" offset="8709308">Certainly, this Court did not intend in Rutter-Rex to overrule its prior decisions in Universal Camera or in Braunfeld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.375" offset="8744835">There, the question of the limitation of review was thoroughly discussed and it's clear that does not mean the same thing as no review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.468" offset="8781197">The power to enforce, modify or set aside Board orders was given by Congress to the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.400" offset="8808991">No standard was set or prescribed by Congress as to when it must exercise that power and one may decline to exercise such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.537" offset="8845563">Such decisions were left into the discretion of the Courts of Appeals subject of course to review by this Court, but review of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.119" offset="8879835">Whether there was an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.829" offset="8890702">The test as was stated in the Pittsburg Steamship is not whether you would make the make the decision as the Court of Appeals made where the case before you in the first instance but whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals constitutes an abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.216" offset="8944201">Abuse has not been shown in this case, and the judgment should therefore be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.461" offset="8965204">Policy arguments directed to the proposition that Raytheon if not ordered to cease-and-desist might engaged in further conduct of violating the act substitute speculation for facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.337" offset="9012746">At the time the case was a heard, almost four years had gone by and no other unfair labor practices had been charge, much less filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.910" offset="9047019">Why should the Court of Appeals be required to deal deeply into the record to decide difficult questions of statutory interpretation, constitutional questions to which they relate, when the evils against which enforcement has sought do not exist?</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.463" offset="9113266">This Court has consistently stated that the federal courts do not have jurisdiction to resolve academic questions, particularly those involve in constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.004" offset="9155375">While the Board may contend that are to seeking in order prevent unlawful conduct in the future, this case can properly be moot when the conduct sought to be enjoined as is conjectural as it is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.260" offset="9208456">Cases cited by the Board from other circuits are not at variance with the position for which we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.226" offset="9232280">Those courts had and exercise of their discretion to grant enforcement on substantially different facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.724" offset="9258297">Whether they or this Court might have decided our case differently is not the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.125" offset="9279822">The question is whether they have the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.391" offset="9288913">Indeed, the Ninth Circuit, which decided our case has followed Mexia as we cite in our brief at -- can you have the page in -- as we cited in our brief at page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.711" offset="9350248">The same panel of judges which decided our case which two of them decided subsequently the repeated case, in which way they like you to follow Mexia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.884" offset="9386924">So, it has not automatically elected to move every case which has there has been subsequent election of compliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.742" offset="9970291">I won't burden the Court with more than just a couple of minutes as the Chief Justice please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.745" offset="9994324">I'd like to begin at the end and respond to the question raised by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.437" offset="10017102">Section 8 (c) of the Act, confers upon employers and employees free speech right, and there is a means by which that you could determine whether or not your First Amendment rights under the Constitution had been adequately protected under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.352" offset="10084812">But I don't think that the respondent company here can pull itself up by its bootstraps with respect to the position it takes in this case because although I was not present when this case was argued before the Court of Appeals, I've argued several such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.722" offset="10158268">I don't know what they were thinking about and what the judges of the Court of Appeals were thinking about but I do know what the record says. with respect to this whole question of mootness, and it says this on page 48 of the appendix, and it's a per curiam statement by the three judges, during oral argument in this Court, counsel for Raytheon made a suggestion of mootness, and the Court grant them lead to file a motion, and then the Court said accordingly on the authority of General Engineering Inc., Raytheon's motions are granted and that proceedings are dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.279" offset="10296508">In General Engineering Inc., it goes off solely on the question of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.302" offset="10316570">And Mr. Justice Stewart raised the question well, how long is this General Engineering case been around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.049" offset="10339558">It was decided in 1962, Mr. Justice but in 1963, the Seventh Circuit, and in 1956, the Fourth Circuit being aware of the General Engineering case, refused to follow it and followed a different result and as a matter of fact, relied upon this Second Circuit decision in Clark Brothers in 1947, and I honestly believe that if the Ninth Circuit had had before it the Mexia Textile case and the Clark Brothers case are they would never arrive at the result that they did in general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.630" offset="10477902">With respect to the question raised by Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Brennan on what happened when you declared moot, what you have is a naked ineffectual statement by the National Labor Relations Board that an employer is engaged in unfair labor practice conduct but you can't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.374" offset="10560867">And I think that that would further complicate the situation because you would again have the total environment be clouded by a statement by National Labor Relations Board that this company didn't engaged in illegal conduct and yet if in fact it had, there couldn't be an order of the Court to make them cut it out and if that happened, I think the company would be under the burden always and be accused of this type of conduct.</text>
