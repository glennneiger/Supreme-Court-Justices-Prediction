            <text syncTime="47.098" offset="291715">However, they were tried together and, therefore, under the rules only one transcript was made available to both defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.061" offset="319613">And that transcript was sent to the codefendant, Pollard, Wade here did not see that transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.781" offset="582510">The case went up on appeal, oral argument was waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.050" offset="615528">The decision was affirmed and thereafter, subsequently, the petitioner instituted proceedings in the California courts to try and obtain a copy of its transcript for the purpose of instituting collateral attack on his convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.661" offset="681984">He first applied to the District Court of Appeals and it affirmed the conviction and that court told him they'd had had no facilities for duplicating the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.238" offset="720332">He applied to the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.960" offset="731199">They told him to go back to the District Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.155" offset="743946">The transcript hereof record then indicates that following correspondence with California courts became clear that in order to obtain a copy of this transcript he would have to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.693" offset="794102">It was available for duplication if he paid for it, but that's the only way that he could get it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marshall L. Small</label>
            <text syncTime="243.981" offset="1079254">Right it would be substantially less than commercial rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.778" offset="1102451">What we have here then in summary is a case that really presents, I think a fairly narrow issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.708" offset="1138186">The case where a defendant was denied his right to a transcript by the application to the California Rules of Court in connection with his direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.442" offset="1185102">And, therefore, it comes around now for purpose of collateral attack as an indigent and is unable to get a copy of this transcript unless he can first demonstrate errors in his original conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.481" offset="1241318">I might add the -- that he filed for habeas corpus in the Federal District Court after he had been turned down by the California courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.638" offset="1277889">The District Court found that, yes, he was entitled to a transcript and order he be supplied one or else discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.866" offset="1306833">The case was taken to the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit reversed and said that he was required to first show meritorious grounds for off setting his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.593" offset="1349778">Turning to the argument now, on the first stage of the argument, the question is to whether he was unconstitutionally denied his right to the transcript in connection with his direct appeal is a predicate for moving on to second stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.040" offset="1403486">We feel that the operation, the California Rules of Court are discriminatory in at least two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.131" offset="1427937">Number one, in the way they discriminate between defendants tried separately and defendants tried jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.869" offset="1454895">If the defendants tried separately, he is entitled to a transcript whether he is a millionaire or a pauper and regardless of the seriousness of the crime involved or the severity of the sentence imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.316" offset="1500662">If he is tried jointly, he isn't entitled to a separate transcript even if he is an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.042" offset="1527515">We also feel that as a second basis for claiming discrimination as far as indigents are concerned the operation of the California Rules of Court preclude an indigent codefendant from receiving a right to a trial transcript in connection with an appeal and this case is an example of how that sort of rule can work.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.560" offset="1621661">So that, therefore, we feel that the rules as they operate tend to unconstitutionally deny particularly an indigent defendant his right to a trial transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.024" offset="1671502">Now, the State has argued that all that's necessary is access and that the attorney on appeal had access to the trial transcript for purpose of briefing the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.765" offset="1730435">First of all, this sort of case demonstrates access may not be sufficient in connection with reviewing the correctness of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.765" offset="1770454">It's -- that's possible and that -- and it worked out that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.356" offset="1784769">Secondly, and perhaps more fundamental, is the burden that it places on appointed counsel in trying to brief and prepare cases if they have only access to a record where they have to borrow it from the Attorney General of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.733" offset="1854255">I have cited in the brief references to some of the problems encountered, discussed and recognized by this Court in the Hardy case, appointed counsel in indigent cases may face when they are trying to prepare cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.452" offset="1913187">So, therefore, the appeal that -- the type of access that the state says was made available here really should not be viewed as constitutionally sufficient for the protection of indigents to give them the same sorts of access to legal channels to effectuate justice as are available to persons who are not indigents.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.009" offset="3319411">Well, I'm a little reluctant to speak from my own personal perusal of the transcript as what apparently happened and since it's not of record in the case, but on the facts that were alleged in the habeas petition here, which haven't been denied, petitioner Wade never saw a copy of his transcript, never had it available.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.263" offset="3420453">One other pint in connection with the state's argument as to access as we -- it was the case here being sufficient it works a particularly discriminatory result on subsequent proceeding on collateral attack because even if you say access is sufficient for any defendant, you only have to allow him to see a transcript and not give him a copy of it then the state switches its position on collateral attack and no longer grants the right of access an in effect is saying, well, you can't see your transcript unless you first show meritorious grounds for off setting your conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.818" offset="3574680">So that even if you were to use the access point that the state is using here to try and uphold the procedure the petitioner here is twice in a less advantageous position than he otherwise would be in.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.461" offset="3637164">The state is arguing in effect two points, essentially two points as I see it in trying to sustain the position that the petitioner should not have a right to a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.744" offset="3698395">They are in effect saying first all that the burden on the state economically would just be terrifying because then anybody could come in and on purposes of collateral attack ask for a right to a transcript, but that isn't this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.540" offset="3773524">They were referring to statistics where maybe no transcript had ever been prepared and the person would come in and apply for a transcript for purposes of collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.134" offset="3811871">This is a case where a transcript had been prepared and was indeed available and could easily have been copied at a fairly small cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.326" offset="3856697">So the type of statistics that the state is citing for the purpose of establishing undue economic burden really aren't relevant to this particular case which is really a fairly narrow case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.583" offset="4149687">The second argument that the state presents for denying his right to transcript to this petitioner is that it may have a deleterious effect on prison discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.261" offset="4196394">A suggestion is made that a prisoner gets a transcript, he might be discussing his case with other prisoners and this could hamper prison discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.248" offset="4232338">I'm a little perplexed by this argument because as I understand it, a prisoner who say was tried individually rather than jointly and convicted and furnished a transcript would be entitled to keep his transcript and have it in prison with him and use it there so that in effect, the state is arguing that it's only codefendants who were tried jointly who might be causing problems with the prison discipline by having the right to their transcripts and the -- I just don't think that this argument really holds water when you look at the practicalities of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.214" offset="4400253">The basic premise I think here come down me is really is the question of trying to balance -- carry out as effectively as possible the administration of justice, the persons who were incarcerated by not clogging up the channels of judicial administration, making available to them the instruments necessary to vindicate their rights, but the same time, not thrusting unreasonable burdens on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.114" offset="4523865">It seems to me that in this particular type of situation where you have the man who would've had a transcript but for the peculiar operation, the discriminatory operation of California law, where a transcript is available and can easily be reproduced that the balance should be struck in favor of making the transcript available to a person such as this indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.643" offset="4633893">In terms of trying to carry out the line of cases, Griffin, Roberts and LaVallee, those cases that try to ensure that the channels of the courts, the access to vindication of legal rights will be available to all without any distinction based on financial position of the defendant involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.318" offset="4832632">First, petitioner Wade is now an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.895" offset="4858964">Second, as a state prisoner, he is a potential applicant for a writ of habeas corpus in the state courts or in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.059" offset="4911626">Third, he is seeking here now a free copy of his trial transcript for no other reason than to comb the records in the hope or anticipation that he'll discover some trial error in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.915" offset="5003055">And the fourth fact and I think this ties in with your question Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's a -- the fact that we have to emphasize in this proceeding is that California has provided this indigent with a trial attorney, a daily transcript during the course of is trial with an appeal, with an attorney on appeal and has given that attorney an access to the trial transcript in the preparation over the brief on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.808" offset="5146624">California has provided all of these services at state expense to this particular indigent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.477" offset="7957295">Now counsel for petitioner has attempted to narrow this down and to paint the state as being irresponsible because it will not come up with $40 or $25 to Xerox a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.118" offset="8031796">We have to look at the holding of the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.720" offset="8046216">The United States District Court said that an indigent prisoner is entitled, free of charge to his trial transcript to explore the record in the hope of finding some flaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.531" offset="8133465">This was the issue that was ruled upon by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit when it reversed the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.911" offset="8423006">Well, I don't know the exact number of copies, but under the rule of court, there would be an original which would've gone to the appellate court and there would've been three copies because this was a capital case, the District Attorney would've received the copy and the Attorney General would've received the copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.503" offset="8505344">The third copy would've gone to be shared by the appellants during the course of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.628" offset="8549857">So, the answer to your question is that there should be an original and two copies somewhere in the state of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.538" offset="8585488">What we think is before the Court, the problem before the Court is not limited to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.583" offset="8617671">The problem before the Court is whether or not when an indigent makes no allegation on collateral attack of any error that occurred in his trial, is the state then responsible to turn over its copy or the copy of any other documents whether they be police reports or any other matters that might be connected with the criminal proceedings, matters of physical evidence that might have been produced at the trial, whether or not the state is then responsible to turn over these documents because the man wants to engage in an exploration or fishing expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.131" offset="8791855">We think the state burden comes to an end, that the conscience of the state, that it is satisfied, that it has given the man due process through a criminal trial in an appellate process, comes to an end when the affirmation of the -- with the affirmation of the decision on that -- on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.205" offset="9108146">You on the other hand say what the issue in this case has nothing to do with that, but rather is the question of whether a state is obligated under the constitution, I suppose now the Due Process Clause to provide at a state convict's arbitrary request, a free transcript of that convict's trial even in the absence of any allegations whatsoever on the part of the convict that any error occurred at his trial that might be subject to collateral attack which is a much broader issue as you correctly say and which frankly it seems to me is what was the issue decided by the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case?</text>
