            <label>Mr. James M. Estabrook</label>
            <text syncTime="12.212" offset="152221">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.351" offset="156818">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.028" offset="175522">I represent the petitioner herein in a petition for certiorari from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.782" offset="206451">George Wood, the original counsel of record who tried this case in Mobile and who argued the case in the Fifth Circuit is very sorry he's unable to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.625" offset="253889">He called me about two weeks ago and said he had the recurrence of a heart condition, asked me if I could possibly argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.502" offset="281370">I agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.738" offset="286281">I was hoping to see him here but unfortunately his brother passed away on Saturday right after a golf game and George was unable to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.904" offset="331003">I represent not only the petitioners herein but I also submitted a brief amicus for the Royal Greek Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.075" offset="359633">As I said before this is an appeal -- a petition for certiorari by Hellenic Lines Limited and Universal Cargo Carriers from a decision of the Fifth Circuit affirming an admiralty decree in the Southern District of Alabama Southern Division in favor of the libellant below the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.704" offset="438209">The accident occurred August 3, 1965 in a libel in rem and in personam was filed August 13, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.526" offset="473527">So the case came up under the old admiralty rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.606" offset="489827">Briefly, the facts which are pertinent are that Rhoditis, the libellant below and the respondent here was a Greek seaman with a wife and two children in Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.629" offset="545938">He is a resident of Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.921" offset="555029">He joined the Greek Flag Motorship Hellenic Hero in Heraklion Crete.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.182" offset="580106">He signed the standard Greek articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.118" offset="595884">While the opinion of the District Court contained in the findings and conclusions stated he is illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.404" offset="620962">He is practically illiterate in English.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.007" offset="631411">The record is disclosing that he can read and write only figures and write only his address in English but that he can read and write Greek since he can write letters to his wife and he can read Greek.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.161" offset="688044">The Hellenic Hero, a Greek flag vessel was sailing in the United States, India, Pakistan Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.604" offset="717824">At the time the depositions herein were taken, the Suez Canal was either open or had just been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.497" offset="753351">Now, this trade through Suez no longer exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.145" offset="771950">The practical difference, however, is this that whereas in -- when the depositions were taken and on the record it appears that Hellenic Lines had 20 ships, 24 ships sailing out of New York and U.S. ports and only 12 ships out of European ports based on Pireas at present.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.385" offset="868916">The American-based ships are down to 20 and the European ships are up to 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.266" offset="900472">The -- also there is some --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="201.446" offset="909145">Well, is this not a situation which fluctuates from time to time depending on the demands for shipping?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="208.267" stopTime="717.389">
            <label>Mr. James M. Estabrook</label>
            <text syncTime="208.267" offset="936417">Of course it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.423" offset="941014">The demands of this case happened to be away from the American trade and in favor to foreign trade also there while the report, the facts as stated by the trial judge stated there was no intermediate traffic at present time, there is a considerable amount of trade between intermediate ports particularly between the Indian, Pakistan ports and South Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.830" offset="1042683">Briefly, the acts did occur in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.186" offset="1056162">As the Hellenic Hero was tying up, and the purpose of this is to show how the acts had really involves only the people of the ship, he was tying up in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.942" offset="1095137">They have the lines opened and the spring line or a line leading from the bow aft not directly to dock but aft to keep the ship from surging ahead was being secured where that is working up in the bow.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.068" offset="1155636">This spring line was secured around the winch and they had been taking the strain on it and when they are going to tie the ship up, they had to take this line which is a heavy wire rope off the winch drum and bend it around bollards which are two iron columns about three feet high and about three feet apart like two fourplex and you bend this wire around the bollards making about eight -- figure eights and that's how you secure the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.000" offset="1279352">But when you take the wire off the winch drum, it's necessary to secure it by a small piece of chain which the interpreter and the record referred to as a keeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.577" offset="1321671">Actually the correct term is stopper and you take the slide chain and you wind it around the wire tying some knots on it and that will take the strain off the wire in the drum because the end of the chain is secured to the bits.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.989" offset="1391365">Then with the strain off the wire and the drum, you can loosen the wire on the drum and put it on the bits.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.743" offset="1422294">Well, they did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.414" offset="1428982">They -- the stopper or keeper looked new, looked to be in good condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.220" offset="1452283">They put it on.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.428" offset="1457089">They took the wire off the drum and they were putting it on the bits and as they were putting it the second turn, the chain suddenly broke as the engines of the ship went ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.850" offset="1510797">That's the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.624" offset="1517902">Why they went ahead, nobody knows, but of course that would put extra strain and the line leading aft extra strain on the chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.372" offset="1548831">The chain broke and the piece of a chain struck Rhoditis in the leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.387" offset="1572968">Rhoditis was then taken to a hospital in New Orleans after his first cast was removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.552" offset="1601599">As soon as he was able to travel, he was moved to Greece and he was able to return to work according to the trial court the next March.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.340" offset="1644753">Hellenic Lines, the employer is a Greek corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.800" offset="1670562">It had in its employ some 1100 seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.118" offset="1695848">It paid taxes last year of over $5 million to Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.583" offset="1709746">Some old repair bills were paid to Greece of about the same amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.294" offset="1724583">It, however, did have a New York office and in the New York office, the record shows it employed between 75 to 100 people depending on whether it appeared to the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.853" offset="1770768">It has a New Orleans office, 10 to 15 people and the Pireas office of 70 to 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.902" offset="1802951">If you disregard the seaman, then you do have more people employed in the offices in New York than in Greece but if you take the seaman into account and they are all Greeks then you have a pronounced Greek flavor to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.798" offset="1862614">There are also some longshoremen employed in New York , stevedores, but we also have longshoremen abroad and actually you employ a lot more longshoremen abroad than you do in this country because you have better machinery in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.319" offset="1912665">So in any international run, you tend to have more longshoremen than the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.018" offset="1939414">We believe this -- however there are some American features the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.165" offset="1968044">The substantial part of Hellenic Heroes trade is to and from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.339" offset="2000750">While Hellenic Lines is a Greek corporation, the majority stockholder and the principal executive officer or general manager of the company is a resident of the United States although a citizen of Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.528" offset="2069504">We have in our brief for the petitioner and the record indicates he received several honors from the kingdom of Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.926" offset="2107120">We are not claiming sovereign immunity, diplomatic immunity or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.332" offset="2128750">Mr. Callimanopoulos has been of assistance, the Greek mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.322" offset="2148707">He is receiving official Greek passport from time to time and the purpose of this proof in the record is to show his allegiance to Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.083" offset="2187682">He is a bona fide Greek citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.263" offset="2196459">He performs duties to the Greek Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.659" offset="2214013">We believe this case comes squarely under the doctrine of Larsen against Lauritzen because both these cases emphasized two things, the primacy of the flag, that is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.678" offset="2274095">The flag of a ship should determine the law applicable to the ship and also the fact that it's important that there will be an available forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.745" offset="2326340">There is an available forum in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.430" offset="2337102">Mr. Rhoditis can pursue his claim for compensation in Greece, and there we must pay him under Greek law and under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.725" offset="2378271">In fact, the collective bargaining agreement specifies particularly the adoption of Greek law and this is very similar to the collective bargaining agreement that was followed by this Court in Larsen against Lauritzen which provided for determination of disputes in Denmark.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.364" offset="2444831">The -- in Larsen against Lauritzen, we had an accident in Havana where the ship sailing between United States and the West Coast of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.896" offset="2486941">Both -- that ship never did go to Denmark in a regular trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.464" offset="2517243">Both vessels had crews of substantially crews of the citizenship of the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.483" offset="2541275">They -- the Randa did have a few Chileans but all the officers and most of the crew were Danes.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.474" offset="2573249">In both cases, the -- we claim the place of the acts in this is unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.478" offset="2597282">In the Randa the man was injured in Havana yet he was brought to the United States for medical treatment and he remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.116" offset="2623822">Larsen actually remained in the United States until he was able to sail again, so the medical testimony was readily available here yet the Court held that Jones Act did apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.744" offset="2662379">In both cases, the court was based for the seaman who was engaged under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement negotiated with the assistance of the national union and the national association of shipowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.879" offset="2730924">We the petitioner here and the Greek Government are both very much opposed to the "runaway flag".</text>
            <text syncTime="664.006" offset="2759346">Insofar as the respondent and his amici argue against the runaway flag were or in fully in a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.140" offset="2807933">We believe that argument is solved but we say it does not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.673" offset="2834056">Our position is that as stated in the Larsen case and quoted in my brief amicus, "Each state under international law" it's page 3 "may determine for itself the conditions upon which you can grant us nationality to a merchant ship thereby accepting responsibility for it and acquiring authority over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.810" offset="2918588">We believe that the phrase "accepting responsibility" is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.203" offset="2940217">If a nation does not accept responsibility for its merchant ships then that you have a runaway flag situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.290" offset="3024541">He can -- it still subsists, that was -- we have the same thing in Tsakonites, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.744" offset="3046379">Tsakonites brought his case up in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.394" offset="3060903">This Court denied certiorari and thereupon Tsakonites commenced proceedings in the Greek court and recovered and that is exhibit A on the Greek Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.122" offset="3123911">If you don't accept responsibility for a ship then you have true runaway flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.103" offset="3143764">For instance, you may have a ship under say Panamanian or Liberian Registry with a Cayman Island crew, Norwegian officers and Spanish engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.530" offset="3189530">You don't have the regular inspection that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.031" offset="3199457">The Greek Government insists on regular inspections of the ship, regular surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.620" offset="3221817">It insists on Greek ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.052" offset="3235610">If you have a foreign corporation owning a Greek ship then does exists here then the technical ownership was in universal cargo carriers, a Panamanian corporation but the ship was in fact operated by Hellenic who hired the crew then you must under Greek law have an agent in Greece who can make the reports necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.601" offset="3353788">You must have the ship under the Greek flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.061" offset="3371656">I mean you do have a -- you must also have a Greek crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.792" offset="3382523">You must have Greek officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.972" offset="3391300">You have a pension plan in Greece known as NAT capital N, capital A, capital T to which all Greek seamen must contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.095" offset="3451800">To this doctrine of recognizing responsible flags has been followed by this Court not only Larsen against Lauritzen in 1953 but again in 1959, in Romero case where a Spanish seaman was injured on a Spanish ship in the port of New York, the Court held that Spanish laws should and not the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.347" offset="3560782">A similar case in McCulloch against Honduran Union quoted in the petitioner's brief where the Court -- this Court held that the National Labor Relations Act would not apply to Honduran flag ships with Honduran crews operated by Honduran corporations between New York and Honduras even though the Honduran corporations were subsidiaries of an American corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.696" offset="3686170">The -- they recognized the law of the flag as being a responsible flag for the reason that these Honduran ships were actually meant by Hondurans and they had Honduran officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.402" offset="3748968">The background being of course that these ships were carrying bananas and one of the conditions for granting banana concessions, the fruit company would be that bona fide Honduran ships would be used to transport bananas and while the ultimate directions of these ships is in the United States, the allegiance of the owner, a Honduran corporation was to the Republic of Honduras.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.597" offset="3849801">For that reason when the Court declined to apply the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1039.744" offset="4262327">Certain sections of that Act specifically apply to foreign ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.621" offset="4285837">I'm talking primarily about the provision against advances that applies to foreign ships as well as to American ships and so states in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.586" offset="4329723">There's another section, the so-called penalty wage statute that specifically applies to foreign vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.946" offset="4355114">That requires a shipowner to pay half earned wages in an intermediate port and all of the earned wages within four days after arriving from a foreign voyage at the port of destination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.878" offset="4422928">When those two sections were originally enacted, I believe it was the Shipping Act of 1916 or maybe a little earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.968" offset="4451244">They were in general terms such as the Jones Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.740" offset="4518327">At that point, both sections were amended specifically to apply foreign vessels.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.850" offset="4714768">Well, obviously, you wouldn't expect the British or Japanese or Greek ship to see an American consul in London.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.286" offset="7184488">According to this Court in the Lauritzen case, there are two justifications for disregarding the law of the nation of the vessel's foreign flag in order to apply American law in a suit such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.888" offset="7226911">The first justification is if the flag is merely one of convenience and not bona fide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.951" offset="7247182">The other is if there exists some heavy account of weight to even a bona fide foreign flag, we contend in this case that this is -- this Greek flag is a flag merely of convenience by virtue of the following facts which I shall attempt to state as briefly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.681" offset="7314056">The ship owner in this case Mr. Callimanopoulos, a Greek citizen concededly and the owner of the petitioner corporations started a shipping business in Greece in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.426" offset="7357106">This Greek operation operated from Greece was reduced to absolutely nothing in World War II by sinking an enemy action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.329" offset="7388662">At the end of World War II during which incidentally the Greek Government had confiscated his ships for military defense purposes, in 1945 he came to the United States and started over a completely anew in the shipping business such that there was no continuum of Greek operation and Greek flag used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.608" offset="7469850">He started over here as if he had never been in any shipping business anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.001" offset="7491375">And the fact is that now, he has been a domiciliary of this country for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.408" offset="7516975">During the last 19 of which, he has enjoyed permanent resident alien status.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.778" offset="12690474">Though I think there's a good reason based on language of Mr. Justice Jackson in the Lauritzen case, he pointed that the laws of this -- the shipping laws of this country which are contained in Title 46 are many and of those very few are specific in their language, in their application either to American or foreign shipping operations and this is what he said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.015" offset="12783470">He said many give no evidence that Congress addressed itself to their foreign application and are in general terms which leave their application to be judicially determined from context and circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.296" offset="12840521">He decided that where Congress has been silent, while it is not -- the courts not only made but they must speak on what they mean and then specifically with reference to the Jones Act, he said Congress could not have been unaware of the necessity of construction imposed upon courts by such generality of language and was well warned but in the absence of the more definite directions than are contained in the Jones Act, it would be applied by the courts two foreign advanced ships and foreign seamen in accordance with the usual doctrine and practices of maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.903" offset="12975000">So apparently Congress has felt that the courts must and are able to determine in each case whether they are sufficient contacts of the United States as weighed by the seven factors to Lauritzen test to warrant or justify the application to foreign transactions or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.966" offset="13055248">So that in effect, it has not been necessary for Congress to legislate on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.657" offset="13073951">I think it would even be dangerous for Congress to legislate on that because these shipping operators -- the national symbols for which they surround themselves are but part and parcel of the paraphernalia that's dictated by the exigencies and convenience of their economics and commerce and the scrambled types of transactions at which we have a wonderful example here are just typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.222" offset="13160260">And it would be very difficult for Congress to comprehend in one act something that would slice the line between a bona fide foreign operator like Mr. Jay Lauritzen of Denmark who has always incidentally been a Danish domiciliary and an operator like Mr. Pericles Callimanopoulos who is enjoying the privileges and the immunities as American citizen by living here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.177" offset="13444054">Incidentally, with regard to what I contend as a flag of convenience here, I would be the first to say that if Mr. Callimanopoulos had just recently come over here, -- if he had just recently come here and then only temporarily to get started, a United States office is merely a small branch to a Greek office and they were a continued and uninterrupted use of Greek flags as part of a principal business in Greece which is not the case and even Your Honor would say that the Court of the United States would be stretching matters rather far to brand his flags as flags of convenience but whereas here, there's an overwhelming preponderance of contacts with the United States as I've outlined and corporate registry in Panama, it is obvious that what this man is doing is dictated by convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.197" offset="13656168">And if the Court is prepared to say that even under these circumstances, such a flag is a bona fide flag, then I would conclude that the United States has become a fair game to a certain extent for economic parasites to entrust themselves like binnacles in the whole of our maritime commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.071" offset="13723669">But getting to Tsakonites, in Tsakonites, the basis of the decision was, I beg your pardon, let me say that no case has really set forth guidelines as to what determines whether a flag is one of convenience or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.021" offset="13787408">Our courts have had no difficulty for instance in saying that where American citizens domiciled here and operating ships from here, have gone shopping abroad in a foreign marketplace of flags and gotten a foreign flag, and such a flag is obviously not a good faith flag and on the other hand, where it is foreign citizens with a bona fide foreign operation and the foreign flag of the same nation, then that is obviously a bona fide flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.043" offset="13895555">But these facts are in between and I would think that the Court would be doing a service at least to the Circuit Courts Of Appeal to tell us what is the flag of convenience so that never again shall two circuit Courts Of Appeal look at identical facts and come up with opposite conclusions as the Fifth and the Second have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.803" offset="13970578">Now, this was the reason for the Second Circuit's decision in Tsakonites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.244" offset="13984371">It was the law of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.868" offset="13990849">They conceded their own confusion as a result of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.330" offset="14004642">They said, "We must concede that these -- this constellation of facts" and I'm only paraphrasing, "presents a combination never before seen in any other case and they took the easy but the wrong way out and decided the case on the law of the contract which as I believe has been well dealt with cannot wag the dog, that's only the tail and the act of the law must be determined on the basis of the seven Lauritzen factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.321" offset="14116655">I believe I have also indicated that it is not necessary for Your Honors to decide that this flag is one of convenience in order to uphold the Fifth Circuit even if it is a bona fide flag in accordance with Lauritzen, there exists to it that heavy counterweight of the domicile and national allegiance of the shipowner.</text>
