            <text syncTime="11.510" offset="149400">This case calls into question the constitutionality on an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.056" offset="175626">The statute involved as part of Section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.313" offset="200600">This statute is set forth on page 45 and 46 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.537" offset="221497">Section 301 (a) (7) includes among those who are declared to be citizens of United States at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.036" offset="259532">Persons who are born abroad of one alien parent and of one citizen parent who has resided for a specified time in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.362" offset="300805">Section 301 (b) provides that such persons that is person foreign born persons who derive their American Citizenship from one American parent, must come to the United States prior to their 23rd birthday and remain here continuously for five years, prior to reaching age 28 in order to retain their American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.112" offset="407803">Another Section of the code provides that absences from the United States of less than 12 months in the aggregate will not break the required continuity of the physical presence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.950" offset="459212">The facts in this case were stipulated and can be stated quite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.989" offset="479378">The appellee, Aldo Mario Bellei was born in Italy in December 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.288" offset="508531">His father is a native and citizen of Italy, although Bellei became an Italian citizen at birth and is an Italian citizen today.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.892" offset="550954">He also acquired American citizenship at birth under the predecessor of Section 301 (a) (7), because his mother had been born and raised in the United States and was an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.192" offset="604139">Appellee resided in Italy from the time of his birth until recently, when he moved from Italy to England.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.844" offset="630784">Prior to his 23rd birthday, he made four brief visits to United States, the longest of these being four months in duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.545" offset="665579">On several occasions, when he applied for renewals of his United States passport, he was advised by American consul officials that he must satisfy the requirement of the period of continuous presence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.529" offset="721481">When the appellee did not heed these warnings and remained in Italy past his 24th birthday, his passport was canceled on the ground that he was no longer an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.626" offset="773831">Thereafter, the appellee instituted this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief premised on the contention of Section 301 (b) is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.118" offset="815835">A three-judge District Court sustained the appellee's claim to American citizenship, holding section 301 (b) unconstitutional on the authority of this Court's decisions in Schneider versus Rusk and Afroyim versus Rusk.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.975" offset="875290">The government has appealed directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.319" offset="892635">We argue in this case that the type of citizenship involved here is of an entirely different type than that involved in Schneider and Afroyim, that it owes it's existence entirely to legislative judgment and that the provision for it's termination is a reasonable exercise of the same authority by which appellee citizenship was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.422" offset="985109">We contend further that a decision sustaining this statute would not undermine the principles on which this Court's previous decisions rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.789" offset="1026487">We build our argument on the following points.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.925" offset="1039026">First, there is no claim that Section 301 (b) is a penal law, either in its intent or in its effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.546" offset="1069537">Residents abroad is not a criminal or reprehensible act declared by the American government or by the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.574" offset="1105690">The loss of citizenship is in no way intended to punish such absence from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.558" offset="1129618">Therefore, the principals which underlay this Court's decision in Mendoza Martinez are not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.367" offset="1160861">Second, the laws of nationality under Section--</text>

            <text syncTime="267.321" offset="1172668">Mr. Connolly, if the constitutional stand would have be that one can't lose citizenship without voluntarily giving it up, I take it this argument wouldn't hold, would it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Connolly</label>
            <text syncTime="288.401" offset="1256991">I think we could make a contention that absence abroad of extremely long duration may indicate of voluntary relinquishment of American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.193" offset="1320103">But then we would be struck with a counter argument, premised on Schneider that we would be distinguishing between this class of American -- unreasonably distinguishing between this class of American citizens and other citizens who require their citizenship --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="321.902" offset="1390947">So that if a voluntary relinquishment were the standard you would probably --</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="325.997" stopTime="327.189">
            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Connolly</label>
            <text syncTime="325.997" offset="1407352">I think that that's right Mr. Justice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="327.189" stopTime="328.395">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="327.189" offset="1412159">Yeah.</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="328.395" stopTime="498.681">
            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Connolly</label>
            <text syncTime="328.395" offset="1416965">And we're contending quite forcefully in this case that voluntary relinquishment is not necessarily the standard because of the like Fourteenth Amendment foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.283" offset="1468479">Our second point is that the laws of nationality under Section 301 unlike the statute involved in Trote versus Dallas, does not create the risk of statelessness, which concerned Chief Justice Warren in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.966" offset="1523231">The legislative history set out in our brief shows the Congress was concerned with the problem of dual nationality and the protection of persons abroad who held American citizenship for owing primary and permanent allegiance to another country.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.447" offset="1589164">To such persons, the laws of American citizenship does not result in statelessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.202" offset="1612152">They simply retain the citizenship of the country to which they have shown their principal attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.344" offset="1636707">In this case, the appellee is, and always has been, a citizen of Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.091" offset="1659695">Our third point, and this is a critical point of distinction between this case and the Court's recent precedence in the area is that the type of citizenship involved here does not derive any constitutional protection from the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.902" offset="1726986">The majority of the Court in the Afroyim versus Rusk, found in first Section of the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment, a protection against involuntary expatriation for those persons whose citizenship was declared by that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.673" offset="1798040">The process by which the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment was held to include certain substantive guarantees and the type and scope of these guarantees are matters which I confess are not entirely clear to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.790" offset="1854568">But it does seem clear that whatever those rights may be, they are in guaranteed only to those persons whose citizenship is declared by the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.272" offset="1908485">The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment reads, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and other state wherein they reside.”</text>
            <text syncTime="466.408" offset="1968985">The appellee of course was not born in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.209" offset="1988211">There may be some questions whether he acquired his citizenship by naturalization although it is not pressed that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.368" offset="2016841">We doubt whether Section 301 (a) (7) can be considered in naturalization statute as that term is used in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.153" offset="2051950">We can find no authority that the reconstruction Congress view the statutory acquisition of citizenship at birth as part of the naturalization process.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.705" offset="2094164">But even of it is assumed --</text>

            <text syncTime="498.681" offset="2098134">But how -- what then should constitutional authority of Congress to make him an American citizen?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Connolly</label>
            <text syncTime="506.117" offset="2127809">Mr. Justice, that is not entirely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.125" offset="2139826">The court below passed over the point in its opinion and in our brief we agreed that there was constitutional authority to grant this type of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.183" offset="2188100">We suggest that that have might be premised on the naturalization clause and it might be premised upon the Congress' inherent powers, the legislative body of a sovereign to declare the classes of persons who will be considered as citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.225" offset="2264273">My own research in the area leads me to conclude that the creation of this class of citizenship is in the exercise of an inherent power rather than the--</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="552.641" offset="2313906">Of course under that power could the Congress make every resident of Canada or every Canadian an American citizen really by legislation?</text>

            <text syncTime="566.599" offset="2369808">It perhaps could.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.045" offset="2379525">The basis for my conclusion is that the Congress -- according to the English precedent where the use solely was the fundamental law of citizenship, but as I'll show later, was amended by the parliament in 1350 to provide for a limited grant of citizenship to children born of British nationals overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.396" offset="2496972">That the English authorities viewed that as of the same order of creation of citizenship as the natural law of use solely, and that it wasn't considered to be part of the naturalization process which proceeded separately by separate statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.833" offset="2566666">I believe that that was the approach which the founding fathers had in the Constitution that is to the extent that this power is existing in Congress, it exists as a natural incident of the sovereignty and there is very limited authority to cite for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.527" offset="2645452">The very first statute --</text>

            <text syncTime="702.109" offset="2911796">No Mr. Chief Justice, because the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to take care of a particular problem in the United States at that time in securing of the right of citizenship to the newly freed slaves and it since had been interpreted more broadly to have rights involving rights associated with the preservation of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.029" offset="3023496">But insofar as the citizenship is to be created by the Congress in the exercise of its power to define citizens of the United States, then it must be admitted that that power has -- that included within that power is the authority to impose reasonable conditions upon that citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.360" offset="3560782">This is so because he was neither naturalized in the Unites States nor was he subject to the jurisdiction of the United States when he acquired his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.296" offset="3608534">The history of the amendment confirms when its language unmistakably contemplates that it was directed to events occurring in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.606" offset="3777808">Thus Congress, when dealing with the question of citizenship in that aspect, treated aliens residing in this country as “under the jurisdiction of the United States” an American parents residing abroad as “out of the jurisdiction of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="938.623" offset="3857847">Passing onto page 688, this sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment is declaratory of existing rights, it's the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment and affirmative of existing law, as to each of the qualifications therein expressed, born in the United States, naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.464" offset="4321259">This was established more than a hundred years ago by Mr. Horace Benny, in his study which is thrice been cited by this Court with approval, it appears in 2 American Law Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.096" offset="4367757">At common law, the foreign-born child of English citizens did not inherit the right of English citizenship and such a child was treated as an alien in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.562" offset="4413628">The first statute to remedy this was passed in 1350, the 25th year of the reign of Edward III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.982" offset="4443303">That statute which granted citizenship at birth to a child born abroad of two English parents, and subsequent statutes on the same subject were construed strictly by the English courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.906" offset="4502967">This Court's decision is Montana versus Kennedy, decided nine years ago, puts to rest any notions that the rights of children born abroad to American parents are greater than what Congress has provided in its citizenship laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.905" offset="4574960">The petitioner in that case was born in Italy to an Italian father and an American mother in 1906, when the law provided for citizenship by inheritance only from American fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.898" offset="4630967">Shortly after his birth, he was brought to the United States where he resided continuously for 50 years without ever been naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.805" offset="4670568">When the government sought to deport him as an alien, be brought an action for a declaratory judgment of the citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.468" offset="4701288">Eight justices of this Court held that he was not a citizen of theUnited States because he did not come literally within the grant of citizenship in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.712" offset="4746219">Surely, a federal common law where the Constitution afforded any rights of citizenship to the foreign born, they would have been exercised in favor of this man who had resided in this country for more than 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.954" offset="4803166">On the basis of the foregoing points, the primary question presented in our view is whether the Congress in the exercise of this power to grant citizenship to the foreign born children of American citizens, they condition that grant on the child's coming to live in the United States for a certain period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.116" offset="5007862">The legislative history of the requirement of five years continuous presence in the United States shows the Congress was concerned with the unsatisfactory status of persons abroad, having both American citizenship and citizenship in another country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.098" offset="5071809">This was and it is today a legitimate concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.989" offset="5091349">The presence of American citizens abroad imposes on our government a duty to assure proper treatment of their persons and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.624" offset="5125831">The carrying out of this duty inevitably results in international conflicts with the other nation which also regards the individual as its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.521" offset="5165432">An examination of any of the several textbooks on nationality will reveal that there are many types of conflicts which may develop on matters such as reparations, protests, and claims for lawsuits, and it also would reveal that the fact that the law has not settled on the resolution of many of these conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.462" offset="5249233">These conflicts are to bar the language of Mr. Justice Brennan, serious problems, inevitably implicating nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.205" offset="5288208">To continue with Mr. Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in Mendoza Martinez, “we have recognized the entanglements which may stem from dual allegiance, and have twice sustained statutes which provide for the loss of American citizenship upon the deliberate assumption of a foreign attachment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.320" offset="5372635">The Congress recognized that an unconditional granting of American citizenship solely because that one of the individual's parents was an American citizen, meant that our government would risk involvement in such international disputes on behalf of persons who had no attachment or allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.747" offset="5454346">This much, the court below also recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.360" offset="5468766">It said, “There is an undeniable danger that children born and raised abroad, in a foreign home where English may never be spoken, school where English is not thought, celebrating foreign holidays with the family of the non-American parent, will have no meaningful connection with the United States, its culture or heritage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.459" offset="5557164">It is a legitimate concern of Congress that those who bear American citizenship and receive its benefits have some nexus to the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.719" offset="5602200">Plus, the Congress decided that in continuing the grant of American citizenship, to foreign born persons to which the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply, it was desirable to reduce the risk that there would be class of citizens living permanently abroad having no attachment to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.955" offset="5675238">It sought to achieve this goal as it had done under the naturalization laws by requiring a period of residence in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.211" offset="5712227">In light of the considerations which prompted in, we think that this requirement is entirely reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.861" offset="5834794">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, something along that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.961" offset="5847228">It says that the same considerations which prompted Congress to require a period of residence in the United States for aliens, to make sure that they have some association with life in the Unites States, are the same considerations which prompted the Congress to enact this particular requirement and in this case, coupled with the fact that the presence of such people abroad imposes versions of the United States in it's diplomatic representations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.541" offset="5969586">The final question then is whether Congress may constitutionally, make a residence requirement, a condition of the continuation of this statutory citizenship rather than the acquisition of the citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.022" offset="6031444">The Congress of course could have provided that children born abroad of one American parent shall become citizens after a period of residence in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.687" offset="6074075">But this would have had unfortunate consequences during the child's minority when the American parent could not be rely on American diplomatic protection for his or her child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.111" offset="6119842">It also would have created novel problems of status and rights when the child returned to this country in order to fulfill his residence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.781" offset="6158503">So the Congress would like to declare the minor child as citizen, but to condition the grant of lifetime citizenship, when the child's coming to the United States and residing here for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.383" offset="6212942">This too we think was a reasonable decision by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.223" offset="6228302">It did not violate the due process rights of the appellee and others affected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.712" offset="6258186">Appellee had American diplomatic protection during his minority when he was dependent on his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.173" offset="6284100">There was no contention that he suffered any disability or any prejudice by reason of being an American citizen during his minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.295" offset="6316596">When he came of age, the Congress in effect asked him the question that it properly could ask in granting citizenship to such persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.959" offset="6355257">Is your sole allegiance to the United States or is your allegiance to Italy where you were born and raised, where you went to school, where you worked and married?</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.260" offset="6396426">The Congress asked only that he come to this country and be part of it's life for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.103" offset="6423803">There is no reason apparent for the appellee's failure to do so other than that he was too deeply involved in activities in his homeland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.310" offset="6460583">For us, there is no apparent reason why he should be able to command United States citizenship for the rest of his life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.076" offset="6535711">In addition to the usual documents of this case, the Court should also have before it the briefs, amici curiae in one of which the American Bar Association has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.326" offset="6612720">May I spend just a brief a moment on the facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.215" offset="6632260">Aldo Mario Bellei's mother was born and raised in Philadelphia where she stayed until she was 24 when she married Aldo Mario Bellei's father and moved within the Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.729" offset="6686281">Her parents have remained in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.610" offset="6701850">On five different occasions, Aldo Mario Bellei came to this country to visit his grandparents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.653" offset="6734033">On the first two such occasions, he came on his mother's passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.950" offset="6751169">And on the second two such occasions, he came on his own passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.263" offset="6768410">The fifth occasion, our state department denied him a passport, this is when he wanted to come here with his bride to visit his grandparents and he did, but he did that on an Italian passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.304" offset="6816580">Aldo Mario Bellei has had his own United States passport as an American citizen for a period of 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.987" offset="6855346">He first got it as you will see from page 6 of the appendix on June 27, 1952, if you'll turn to page 11, you will find that it was renewed from time to time until February 11, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.956" offset="6943222">Now, the government comes along with the conditions subsequently imposed and seeks to take this way and I think this case presents the simple question, whether the Congress has the power with reference to an American citizen at birth to take away that citizenship without his voluntary renunciation and can do that consistent with the due process cause of the Fifth Amendment, that's what I think the issue is on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.877" offset="7078849">And in answer to the question that you put, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I think it is the government's position that two aliens coming over here, having a child born here and returning to their own country or the case of a person's naturalized over here with a minor child, that those children have greater rights than a person like Aldo Mario Bellei, who by Section 1993 of Revised Statutes and as amended by the Nationality Act of 1934 was given American citizenship at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.914" offset="7267035">I think as a matter of act that Schneider against Ruck is precisely in point because Angelika Schneider never went through naturalization proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.391" offset="7316982">Her parents came over and were naturalized at an Act of Congress then said that she was an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.729" offset="7346239">I cannot see what Schneider against Rusk is directly in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.084" offset="7367659">And then in that case, it was held at the fact that Angelika Schneider who had citizenship by statute, she could go abroad to Germany and stay there and the three-year residence requirement was declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.908" offset="7435055">I submit the same reasoning that in Schneider against Rusk compelled that provision to be held unconstitutional compels the Section that was attacked and held unconstitutional below which is the provision of the immigration of Nationality Act of 1952, is likewise unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.936" offset="7515094">The provision at the time that Aldo Mario Bellei was born, required that he come here for five years, immediately previous to his 18th birthday and unless within six months after the child's 21st birthday, he or she shall take both of allegiance to the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.070" offset="7619688">Now, that Section was repealed by the Nationality Act of 1940, but that repeal had in it this proviso that the repeal shall not terminate nationality heretofore lawfully acquired.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.547" offset="12261543">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.445" offset="12269171">Mr. Rogge I believe, certainly unintentionally left the impression that the requirement of presence in the United States was imposed on Mr. Bellei after a conferral of American citizenship on him at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.911" offset="12327058">That is not quite accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.381" offset="12332910">He received his American citizenship pursuant to Section 1993 of the Revised statutes as amended in 1934 and that's as the statute set forth in page 44 of our brief, and it does provide for a period of residence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.763" offset="12418382">Indeed a more onerous period of residence in United States in present law under which Mr. Bellei's situation was tested because it must be accomplished by the age of 13 I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.269" offset="12476479">Now, Mr. Rogge also misinterprets the government's position, if I may say, on the moral word, if you will, that he children who were born overseas and who are subject to the requirement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.928" offset="12539068">We make no claim that these children cannot be good Americans, but we think that there is something much more to performing the duties of an American citizenship from watching American movies and American television overseas, and eating hotdogs and bubble gums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.540" offset="12613569">And what Congress was looking for and what Congress had provided for by the period of residence in the United States was the assurance that these children, these young adults, wherever they reside for the rest of their lives and they could go back overseas and have no restrictions on them or whatsoever, would be persons who had some meaningful relationship to the United States, some ability, some personal understanding of how the institutions and people of the United States operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.018" offset="12739480">And some ability if necessary to contribute to the development of those institutions, a personal stake, in other words in the institutions and people of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.344" offset="12784724">Another point that I would like to make in the very few minutes that I have left, is that Mr. Rogge invoked considerations of a shrinking world, expanding notions of nationality, but these notions were encountered due to a developing trade and international law, which I'm not entirely familiar, but I've done some research on, which shows that because of the problem of duo nationality, international lawyers are struggling with the concept similar to that in our domestic conflict of laws of effective nationality as recognizing the persons may have citizenship in a number of states or usually two countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.468" offset="12973223">Where the rights of the citizens are to be asserted, the test is where the real and effective citizenship of the individual is and one exercise in this development is the article of the convention of the conflict of nationality laws in 1930 which I will not take time to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.118" offset="13067891">Another example is the decision of the Court of International Justice, in the Natobong case in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.943" offset="13099133">For those reasons Mr. Chief Justice, we submit that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed.</text>
