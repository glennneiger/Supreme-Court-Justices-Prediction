            <label>Mr. Robert H. Quinn</label>
            <text syncTime="7.948" offset="135189">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.775" offset="166431">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.565" offset="185657">This matter is here on appeal from an interlocutory order of the United States District Court, for the district of Massachusetts, under the provisions of 28 United States Code 1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.536" offset="245530">That provides for direct appeal from an order or judgment of a three-judge court granting temporary injunctive relief against enforcement of a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.082" offset="291715">In our view, this appeal presents two equally important issues, which ought to be finally resolved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.429" offset="329122">The first is whether the court below abused its discretion in enjoining the district attorney from prosecuting in the future on account of the showing of the film, “I am Curious Yellow,” which the court below assumed to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.943" offset="403101">The second is whether under this Court’s holding in Stanley versus Georgia, any state can constitutionally prohibit public, commercialized dissemination of pornographic matter, absent distribution to minors, non-consenting adults, or by pandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.325" offset="492648">The facts maybe stated briefly as follows: On June 30, 1969, after preliminary proceedings not relevant here, the appellees filed an amended complaint in the court below, alleging reason to believe that indictments would be sought against them, by appellant Byrnes office, under Massachusetts general laws, Chapter 272, Section 28 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="123.568" offset="597661">Shortly thereafter, the indictments were in fact sought and returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.002" offset="623365">Appellees saw the declaration that the statute is unconstitutional and that injunction against prosecution there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.575" offset="657638">They alleged the statute was overbroad, because among other things, adequately controlled commercial distribution of obscene material is protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.684" offset="710092">The court declined to grant injunctive or other relief, but requested briefs on the questions regarding the scope of this Court’s holding, in Stanley versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.506" offset="757426">And the effect of that opinion on the Massachusetts Statute, prosecution continued in the state court, in a jury waived session and the appellees were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.857" offset="810820">Following their conviction, the appellees renewed their request for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.416" offset="833076">After further argument, a majority of the court below held that Stanley versus Georgia went so far as to prohibit state prosecutions, with respect to adequately controlled public distribution of obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.962" offset="903189">And the court decided that the Massachusetts Statute was probably unconstitutional as being overbroad on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.525" offset="941432">Based on this opinion, a majority of the court below enjoined the appellants from further prosecution with respect to showing of the film, I’m Curious Yellow.”</text>
            <text syncTime="221.602" offset="989811">This matter was argued before this honorable Court on April 38th and subsequently ordered for re-argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.432" offset="1021053">In the meantime, the appellees’ appeal was entered in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.753" offset="1042369">Oral argument in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has been delayed, pending a motion for postponement filed by the appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.280" offset="1080508">I address myself first to the question, whether the court below abused its discretion in granting injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.027" offset="1119483">Comity and federalism prompt a federal judge to be extremely reluctant to enjoin good faith enforcement of a state’s criminal laws by that state's law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.716" offset="1178206">What have we here to contravene that fundamental principle?</text>
            <text syncTime="274.076" offset="1199626">No monetary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.325" offset="1208717">There is no evidence whatsoever of any financial loss on the part of appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.161" offset="1232018">They had no proprietary interest in the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.269" offset="1244453">They’re not the owners of a film.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.675" offset="1254066">Rather they own a movie house.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.439" offset="1269112">There's no chilling effect either on the appelles or their patrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.362" offset="1288861">These are not politically hand bills, but commercial pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.263" offset="1312475">Assumptively in the court below and after a finding in a trial, a subject matter assumed to be obscene, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.308" offset="1360645">All the more so is subject matter found in a trial below to be obscene, cannot be said to have any value within itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.172" offset="1404008">This film further showed for five-and-a-half months, pending the argument on the merits and the decision of obscenity on the facts, in a trial, in the Suffolk Superior Court in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.550" offset="1461582">We’ve been only able to find one instance, where this Court approved relief granted against a state law enforcement official.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.825" offset="1506722">That is of course, the decision in Dombrowski versus Pfister in 380 United States 479.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.219" offset="1540263">The Dombrowski case was a matter of civil rights advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.114" offset="1559803">It's record is replete with incidence of bad faith, for example night raids, made by law enforcement officials on the offices and the homes of individuals involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.081" offset="1607659">We have none of that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.714" offset="1618213">Here we have first of all, activity whose dominant theme is offensive to community standards of morality, whose appeal is to a prurient interest in sex, whose content is utterly without redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.661" offset="1689997">Here we have no bad faith, either on the record, or argued below on the part of the prosecution or law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.400" offset="1732942">This has been a single case, pursued by the district attorney in Suffolk County, in the course of his work as the elected district attorney of the people, pursued while the film showing by the appellees in their theater continued for five-and-a-half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.388" offset="1824893">Here, we submit is a classic example for the application of the principle of abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.643" offset="1853942">If the statute, Chapter 272, Section 28 (a) of the Massachusetts General Laws, should be overbroad, and we do not concede this, that’s fault here can be overcome by leaving the case to be resolved in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.868" offset="1922800">And by giving the state court the opportunity to narrowly construe the law and thus, avoid any constitutional defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.427" offset="1965119">This can be--</text>

            <text syncTime="745.417" offset="3085040">I have suggested that in this case pending, we have the classic example for the application of the principle of abstention, by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.259" offset="3740400">As the Court knows, the government appears here today only with respect to the issues in this case, involving the meaning of its decision two terms ago in Stanley versus Georgia and as the Court knows that decision has led to a good deal of ferment in this general area, including the invalidation of two central federal statutes, which we shall be appearing here later in the term to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.842" offset="3874774">The facts of Stanley and we think are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.326" offset="3888671">The police almost by accident searching through an individual’s home for other purposes came upon three reels of motion pictures and some other items, which no one knew were there, looked through those films and concluded that they were obscene, arrested Mr. Stanley for possession of obscene matter, under Georgia’s statute, which permitted punishment for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.851" offset="4010820">The case came here and the Court held and what I think was carefully limited language that the mere possession of obscene matter cannot constitutionally be made a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.232" offset="4056273">That formula -- excuse me?</text>

            <text syncTime="989.528" offset="4061497">Was there any showing in the Stanley case that the possession had been for or was intended for commercial profit, public showing?</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.559" offset="4133595">No one knew that Mr. Stanley had that material or certainly no one in the general public knew that before it was discovered by happenstance in his desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.790" offset="4170480">Well, it's not quite happenstance, the officers were there searching for other materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.246" offset="4208306">So that the issue of public showing or pandering by advertising before public showing were not involved in the Stanley case at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.972" offset="4255222">I don’t think it's necessary, Mr. Chief Justice, to go so far to be as gentle with Stanley as to say that the issue of pandering wasn’t in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.370" offset="4304854">I would put it the issue of public knowledge was not in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.703" offset="4338186">And this Court, I think was quite careful in its statement, regarding that case, to indicate that it was simply a matter of private possession that was before and that that was all that the holding meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.446" offset="4389177">Lower courts however, have not been so minded about the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.440" offset="4413106">There is as the Court knows and I'm sure this Court feels that a good deal of impatience about this very troublesome issue of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.029" offset="4447483">And there are in the opinion here and there remarks which could be take in the way that court below here has taken them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.920" offset="4487084">That if one is careful, if one restricts access to the movie to those who want to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.486" offset="4517282">And to those who are adult enough, so that ordinary parens patriae, considerations do not come into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.781" offset="4546539">And if one doesn’t offend sensibilities by advertising, well, then one has a constitutional right to show the movie, to commercially exploit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.075" offset="4587708">And again, since the Chief Justice has brought it up, I want to stress that we aren’t talking here about commercial exploitation, in the sense of the Ginsburg case in a pandering sense, simply public sale, unadorned by any kind of special attention on the hypothesis of this case to the sexual aspects or the sexually provocative aspects of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.136" offset="4687914">I should like to start my discussion a little way off in the obscenity question, but in a way that I think again, calls attention to this central character of public knowledge of what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.053" offset="4739636">Let us suppose that a traveling carnival should come to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.556" offset="4757608">Setup tents, which are perfectly well enclosed and screened from public view and announce that in those tents, for those who wish to pay and come and see it, there will be a bearbaiting contest in which five dogs and a chained bear will be set against each other, until some or all of the participants are dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.632" offset="4853948">Let's suppose that that could be done in perfect safety for all of the viewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.858" offset="4878817">I think that it maybe perfectly clear that no one would leave that tent to commit an act of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.137" offset="4911940">And I think it may also be clear that no one who would wish not to see the scene in the tent would be forced to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.772" offset="4946422">But I submit it's also clear that the community to which that carnival came could prohibit it, if it were so minded, and that’s a public policy question on which all might not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.553" offset="4997622">But, I think if the community decided to prohibit that show, it could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.747" offset="5018311">The distress which is caused to those who don’t come, but who know what's going to go on in the tent, who know for a certainty what will appear and that is a very real distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.020" offset="5071496">The long term brutalization of society, which the society may fear will result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.664" offset="5094066">The strain on social fabric through public tolerance of what is to many members of that society utterly repellent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.441" offset="5133145">All of these factors would seem to me to justify such regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.089" offset="5151744">It has never been held that society lacks power to protect the sensibilities or to deal with these occurrences, that it must not only tolerate, but in a meaningful sense legitimize these activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.947" offset="6483153">I think I can say no more to it and it maybe in a sense twisting the Court’s language in Reynolds and Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.392" offset="6520978">The Court said that legislatures represent the people, not houses or trees, or I might add dogs or bears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.285" offset="6552534">And in giving that hypothetical, it seems to me that if one thinks about it carefully, one would reach the conclusion that those laws are there not to make the behavior of the dogs and bears criminal, but to protect certain human sensibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.729" offset="6606242">And this is an area of traditional regulation, just as obscenity regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.091" offset="6623692">It's an area of traditional regulation, and one then does get to the question, is it important that this on film as distinct to in a live performance?</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.526" offset="6657442">And I think the answer there is no, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.055" offset="6671548">This Court’s opinion last year in Shack gave no indication that it would have reached the different question, would have reached the different conclusion, had that been a film the Gorilla Theater episode, rather than a Gorilla Theater episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.802" offset="6738631">Indeed, if anything film performances can be even more intrusive in a sense to the society’s sensibilities in a way one has to deal with--in a stage production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.967" offset="6807280">One has to deal with a situation which is necessarily human and in a real sense remote.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.931" offset="6843120">In a film performance with the possibilities of staging, close ups and what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.994" offset="6863391">But these difficulties or I think really very substantially aggravated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.317" offset="6888678">When we come to the question how we’re going to understand Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.042" offset="6907591">The government believes that the Court meant what it said, when it said that Stanley was a holding limited to its fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.193" offset="6932146">And it did not impair the validity of Roth for any commercial setting, as we’ve called the Court’s attention before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.806" offset="6962552">And there is much reference in that opinion to notions of privacy and freedoms from intrusion and we feel those references are central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.919" offset="7003094">And the opinions quotes at length from Mr. Justice Brandeis’s dissent in Olmstead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.591" offset="7029739">It refers to the Griswold opinion, Griswold versus Connecticut, where the court put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.061" offset="7051577">The present case concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy, created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.610" offset="7085850">And it concerns a law, which in forbidding the use of contraceptive, rather than regulating their manufacture or sale seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum disruptive impact upon that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.015" offset="7143424">Stanley is an entirely similar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.163" offset="7160038">It is a case in which the state sought to regulate in a manner having a maximum destructive impact and this Court, I think quite properly said that it might not do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.025" offset="7287515">And I think the Fourth Amendment centrality is made clear by the reference to Olmstead, by the reference to notions of privacy, that the stress really on privacy as a coordinate part of the opinion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.797" offset="7358568">In a way I think it's central to the Stanley opinion, that unlike the other obscenity decisions in this Court, the opinion does not talk about the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.749" offset="7406320">The opinion refers to the rights of the person and not to the protected character of the material or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.587" offset="7445713">And when one starts talking about the individual rather than what he may have and the individual's First Amendment rights, it wasn’t that the material was protected under the First Amendment, but that the individual had First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.251" offset="7508407">Then it becomes, I think clear that what we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.384" offset="7524916">Again, citation to Griswold is a kind of penumbral analysis, which we try and set out in our brief, that to protect the individual’s rights to read, to learn, it is necessary to afford a kind of penumbral protection in which the matters which may not contain information, may not contain ideas are nonetheless ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.981" offset="7635257">And again, I think the Court was very careful, while it did refer to a right to receive information and ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.246" offset="7660335">It never once said that the material, which he had was material which contained information and ideas.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="2162.815" offset="8754657">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.539" offset="8769494">When this case was argued last term, among those argued with it was Gunn versus University Committee, number 7 last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.133" offset="8803871">And which the court dismissed the appeal on the last day of the term, when it set this case and its other companions over for re-argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.105" offset="8835741">On the ground that the three-judge district court in Gunn had failed to enter any injunctive order, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.571" offset="8861654">And it was therefore, quoting the Court’s language, “Not possible to know, with any certainty what the Court has decided.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.481" offset="8901256">In this case, by contrast, the appealed order is short and specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.047" offset="8923512">And it clearly discloses what the court below has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.690" offset="8942111">And we submit that if that injunction is analyzed in terms of what it does not enjoin, as well as in terms of what it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.198" offset="8980146">It emerges as a permissible and proper action, by a Federal District Court, seeking to preserve for state prosecutors and courts, their proper role in the enforcement of restrictions, upon the distribution of obscenity, while retaining the First Amendment rights of motion picture exhibitors and distributors in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.262" offset="9072410">To the extent, I would submit, that the opinion of the court below goes beyond the terms of the preliminary injunction and expresses views concerning the constitutionality of the statute as ultimate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.500" offset="9129357">It's nothing more than an advisory opinion or as was suggested in some of the cases argued before the Court yesterday, in terms of declaratory judgment, which maybe appealable by the state, if it views it is such to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.931" offset="9187140">But, the issue here, we submit, is framed by the injunction, which appears at pages 44 and 45 of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.131" offset="9219845">Now, what does it enjoin?</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.767" offset="9230399">The injunction prohibits and enjoins the defendants, the state prosecutors, local district attorney and the state Attorney General’s office from proceedings civilly or criminally or otherwise interfering with the appellee's exhibition of the film, “I am Curious Yellow” so long as that exhibition is conducted under certain specific circumstances, which cover the areas of pandering, and intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.885" offset="9366862">And it provides in addition, that the order is not to prevent or inhibit in any way, the prosecution of a then pending criminal proceeding in the Massachusetts States Courts, which was then on appeal, from a judgment of conviction and which the motion picture exhibitors, who are perfectly legitimate theater owners and have shown award winning films in the past was sentenced to one year in jail for having shown this film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.590" offset="9477726">Now let me, if I may just clarify for a moment, just to clarify the status of that case, in the Massachusetts state court and supplement somewhat on what Mr. Quinn has advised the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.025" offset="9527463">That case, those convictions, were appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, briefs were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.800" offset="9554526">In the state’s brief, which was response to the appealles brief in the state court, the state concluded with the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.704" offset="9590157">Since--speaking of this Court, that court’s adjudication in the Maryland case, which was argued here last term, will bind the Commonwealth, it is respectfully suggested that this court, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, hold its decision upon the obscenity of the film, in abeyance, pending that adjudication, not the adjudication of this case, but the adjudication of the Maryland case, and which the obscenity of the film is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.821" offset="9690676">Pursuant to that suggestion, these appellees, feeling that that issue would be resolved ultimately by this Court, even irrespective of how they would resolve by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court moved that the issue of obscenity and that issue alone await the decision of this Court in the Maryland case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.427" offset="9761102">But that the other issues be considered by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.178" offset="9780120">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court acting on that notion staid the entire argument of the case, so the entire argument is staid true in form on our motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.658" offset="9829961">But, really at the suggestion of the state that the Maryland case would be dispositive of the issue of obscenity, which I think is plain truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.875" offset="9862875">If the court were to -- there were of course, other issues in the Maryland case, that assume that the court were to reach the issue of obscenity in the Maryland case, and were to decide that question one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.103" offset="9911777">Of course, resolution of that issue, I might say might very--if it were resolved in favor of the film, might very well have the effective mooting out this very case, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.567" offset="9953677">Because the sole issue here is whether these exhibitors may continue to exhibit this film in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.215" offset="9984188">Now--</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.662" offset="10197974">Now, we will definitely address ourselves to those questions, in this portion of the argument, I would limit my argument to -- as it were the Dombrowski, the abstention, the Federalism issues--</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.750" offset="10294418">I’m afraid that on the question of the federalism and the federal court's role in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.412" offset="10316988">Some confusion may have been engendered by papers, which we filed at -- upon the application of the state for stay last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.309" offset="10356590">When it appeared, I believe just from those papers is if in some way, the Federal District Court in this case, was barging into a state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.368" offset="10392848">If anything, the record in this case demonstrate, we submit, that what the District Court below did was at successive stages of this litigation defer and refused to act until the juncture was reached, at which if it failed to act, speech which was eminent, pending, and in fact, had continued until the date of its action, would not merely be chilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.563" offset="10509667">If I may proceed from the Court’s metaphor, but would in fact be put in the deep freeze, because the consequence of the action, which caused the Federal District Court to issue the preliminary injunction, which it did, was the withdrawal by the prosecutor, in the state courts, of an agreement under which he would permit the film to continue to show while the various issues were being litigated through the Massachusetts courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.371" offset="10624815">In fact, what did the court below do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.702" offset="10642160">Its order plainly demonstrates that the court permitted the one pending state prosecution to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.238" offset="10672358">In addition to that, the opinion of the court below and the language of Judge Aldrich, who wrote the opinion, which appears at page 37 of the record, concludes with an explicit caveat to these appellees, stating that the court voices no opinion, as to the legal consequences if plaintiffs exhibit their film, under the protection of our injunction, and it is ultimately determined that our view was mistaken, and that such exhibition was properly considered elicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.689" offset="10790118">In effect, what that language in Judge Aldrich opinion states is that the continued exhibition of the film, even under the protection of the injunction is still subject to the risk that at the conclusion of whatever ultimate decision is reached on the various constitutional issues, these appellees maybe prosecuted, in fact retrospectively for the showing of the film, which they engaged in during the entire period of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.112" offset="10903803">So that is if there is anything that’s clear from the terms and the order, it is that in no way forecloses any state court determination of any relevant issue and in fact doesn’t -- not only under Dombrowski doesn’t enjoin any state prosecution but any pending state prosecution, but doesn’t even enjoin future state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.956" offset="11007248">At most it defers them if they’re legitimate to some ultimate date at which if they can properly be brought they can then be instituted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2764.307" offset="11160639">That’s right, and the order enjoins the institution of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.680" offset="11182059">It does not however say that if the film has finally found obscene, these appellees may not then be prosecuted for having showing the film in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.609" offset="11225840">If the case is viewed as we think it properly should be as to what are the appropriate steps for a Federal District Court to take when it has before a case in which there is some doubt as to the constitutionality of the statute under which the state is proceeding where the State has no injunction power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.940" offset="11303163">And I think that’s important in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.993" offset="11315388">The State of Massachusetts has not authorized each prosecutors to go into court and obtain injunctions against the showing of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.725" offset="11350288">It has an interim proceeding applicable to books but none with respect to films.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.873" offset="11366902">So it authorizes criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.562" offset="11377664">Now there is a criminal prosecution with respect to a film under a statute which is a questionable constitutionality with respect to a film which a Federal District Court has found prior to its opening to be not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.825" offset="11430640">And Judge Aldrich took notice of that too and that appears in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.510" offset="11453419">And the film is shown under very careful safeguards to avoid pandering, any showing to minors, any intrusion on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.063" offset="11491662">In those circumstances, the Federal District Court says in the interim until the issues are resolved we think you have a First Amendment right to show that film subject possibly to future prosecution for you having shown it, but you will not be hold into court everyday and indicted everyday and have the film seized everyday because you are showing it because that would in effect be a form of censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.172" offset="11584031">A form of censorship by threat to be sure but it would be a form of censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.101" offset="11603780">And we submit that that’s under all doctrines of nonintervention or abstention or whatever federal policy applies we think that’s appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.676" offset="11650069">The court below stayed its hand until that point where the threat the prosecutor to make -- to continue to prosecute and to indict and seize the film had the effect of an effect of closing it down.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.756" offset="12102405">No, it’s because it’s an interference with a state criminal process to obtain rights which could not be obtained in the state criminal process Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.614" offset="12141798">In other words, assuming even assuming that the law were which I think this Court’s cases have conclusively established otherwise, but even assuming the law were that one had to exhaust state remedies, as it were to obtain relief from a Federal District Court in a free speech case, in these circumstances, there is no way that these appellees could say and in fact obtain the right to show the film while its obscenity was being -- the matter of its obscenity was being litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.719" offset="12262275">They couldn’t obtain that in a defense to a state criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.294" offset="12276590">There’s just no way they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.329" offset="12280665">They can defend the state criminal prosecution, they can say we’re not guilty, put the state to the test of proving the obscenity of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.863" offset="12306787">But when they want to show the film on November 12, 1969 and thereafter, the only remedy they have is to go into a Federal District Court at that point and say, “We institute this action and seek this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.600" offset="12357778">We have a right to show the film on November 13th and 14th and 15th while it’s obscenity is being tested under the state criminal process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.759" offset="12394454">Now, that we submit is a permissible interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.879" offset="12410859">What the cases prior to Dumbrowski and what the general principle of nonintervention of federal courts and state criminal process involves we submit, are only those instances where the same relief or the relief that the plaintiffs are seeking could be obtained from the state process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.215" offset="12484211">Here, that’s just not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.203" offset="12492152">These appellees, so far as trying to show the film in the interim could not obtain any relief from the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.775" offset="12518484">They could defend the criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.074" offset="12527679">If the state had had an injunctive procedure under which the state prosecutor could go into state court and seek an injunction then they would have that remedy in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.709" offset="12570206">They could defend against bad injunctive proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.860" offset="12578774">Of course, if the state prosecutor decided not to institute it, they would never have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.809" offset="12594657">But assuming it did -- they could defend and litigate the right of showing the film in the interim, there is no such procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.267" offset="12640423">It has a declaratory judgment procedure Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.975" offset="12651290">However, the standards that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court applies in the declaratory judgment cases indicate that this issue could not be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.930" offset="12691101">We have this pending, I think on this Court’s docket now is the case involving the obscenity of the stage play Hare — the PBIC versus Byrne, which involved an attempt to obtain a declaratory judgment from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court which was subject to various state objections that the state raised in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.259" offset="12768423">And that case demonstrates how hard it would be even to obtain a declaratory judgment on the initial question, which is the obscenity of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.730" offset="12806248">But certainly, in terms of the right to show it in the interim, which is really what we say is at stake here and all that is involved in this injunction that right could not be asserted in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.911" offset="12859016">And it certainly could not be asserted in a defense to a criminal prosecution because the only issue in the criminal prosecution would be whether the film is obscene, whether all the other constitution and statutory standards are met and the judgment of conviction and not whether the film would be shown of the 13th or any other days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.105" offset="12931741">On this general principle of nonintervention, if I may just address myself to it briefly, this Court’s decisions ranging way back and certainly commentating in Zwickler and Khuta have made it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.327" offset="13000704">I think Zwickler and Khuta, the Court quoted from a District Court opinion which made it, and I just quote that briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.621" offset="13029857">The Court said, “We yet like to believe that wherever the federal court sit, human rights under the federal constitution are always a proper subject for adjudication, and that we have not the right to decline the exercise of that jurisdiction simply because the rights asserted and they be adjudicated in some other form.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.157" offset="13095999">Now here, in this case we submit follows a fortiori from Zwickler and Dombrowski and all the others because the right that’s covered by this preliminary injunction and let me emphasize it is a preliminary injunction and therefore the standards that ordinarily apply to preliminary injunction, we submit should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.059" offset="13167574">In other words, District Courts have broad discretion to decide on the probabilities of success of the ultimate outcome of the litigation and issue preliminary injunctions in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.072" offset="13215640">Here we deal with a preliminary injunction and we submit for that reason certainly, rights which couldn’t be asserted in a state court, which these appellees had no way of asserting in a state court should properly or properly protected by the Federal District Court and should be affirmed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.616" offset="13297873">Now I would like -- if I may just briefly to go to the question of the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was raised also in the argument last week before this Court, and which we think applies to these circumstances as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.530" offset="13393481">One has here a set of facts in which what the state prosecutors have sought to do was prevent the exhibition of a film under a statute which the court below found and we submit properly a subject to constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.376" offset="13472893">When that film itself had prior to its opening been found to be constitutionally protected by United States Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.850" offset="13514794">Now, we don’t argue and of course we couldn’t argue that defining of United States Court of Appeals is binding on the State of Massachusetts as a matter of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.922" offset="13551052">What we do argue and we elaborate then the distributor who’s the appellant in the Maryland case elaborates at some length and our brief in that case and we think it applies here as well, is that there -- in terms of protecting and giving wide scope to free expression the decision of the Second Circuit and the decision of the Court of Appeals or indeed any decision which is binding on the United States, should as a matter of First Amendment law be applied by this Court to bar other proceedings to prevent the exhibitions of the very same material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.136" offset="13723878">Now that’s just a very -- in terms of the practical consequence on distributors and exhibitors of films and books that’s just a very important rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.318" offset="13764629">This Court has on its docket right now pending in one form or another five cases involving the exhibition of this film, five cases out of the States of Alabama, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland and Ohio all involving the exhibition of this film.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.172" offset="13840071">As was stated in the brief in the Maryland case there were 144 lawsuits in the country involving the exhibitions of this film essentially in the distribution of films and books throughout the United States to put a distributor or an exhibitor who has established to the satisfaction of a Court of Appeals and a judgment binding on the United States which could have enjoined by states throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.060" offset="13951561">That a film or a book is constitutionally protected must we submit act to prevent future harassment, multiplicities of litigation which otherwise makes the distribution of such First Amendment material or arguable First Amendment material close to impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.851" offset="14042781">And that’s why the argument made is essentially that that judgment although not operative as a matter of res judicata should like various other decisions of this Court which have found judgments binding on the United States in the search and seizure area, in the self-incrimination area to be in effect have operative affect on state prosecutors and state bodies that that very same rule should be applied in the field of arguable obscenity in the filed of books or movies that are distributed nationwide that go through a federal proceeding that are conclusively adjudicated by a federal court as being constitutionally protected and should be—we submit free of multiplicities and repeated suits in various local jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="4080.788" offset="16426506">Well I think the Solicitor General has suggested the only possible distinction between the Stanley case and retro cases that preceded it and the case that’s before this Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.199" offset="16468198">That is the distinction which rests on public sensibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.202" offset="16484185">That is the public knows what’s going on in the theater whereas the public does not know what’s going on in a private home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.278" offset="16508531">I submit that that distinction was rejected by this Court in the case of Griswold versus Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.366" offset="16532877">In that case you will recall the prosecution was not directed against the users of birth control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.765" offset="16554402">The couple, the married, couple that was directed against clinics, centers they will call under Connecticut law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.721" offset="16578226">They were open centers, they were visible, they were so to speak on Pennsylvania Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.693" offset="16598183">They were of course discreet and yet they disseminated the information and materials necessary for a birth control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.161" offset="16623992">The public, knew that birth control information was being disseminated and the public in Connecticut was offended by that fact alone as reflected by its legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.041" offset="16663489">Yet this Court decided not only to protect the rights of those who would use birth control materials and information but also necessarily by its holding the right of a clinic though its public in some senses to discretely give out the information and materials necessary for the effectuation of the primary right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.002" offset="16739349">Now in an important respect, this case is a fortiori from the Griswold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.017" offset="16759411">The Griswold case involved purely, the Fourth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.596" offset="16773726">The constitution is neutral on whether or not couples practice birth control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.810" offset="16790653">There is no First Amendment right involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.613" offset="16801834">Indeed, it’s an activity rather than any arguable speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.376" offset="16816880">So that case relied exclusively under Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.939" offset="16827120">This case although it may conceivably have Fourth Amendment overtones, we concede it cited the Olmstead case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.689" offset="16850108">Certainly also the Government would concede has important First Amendment overtones.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.643" offset="16865991">The primary right, the right to satisfy ones emotional and intellectual needs in the privacy of his home is a First Amendment right centrally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.087" offset="16899741">And so one would think, I certainly would argue that the decision of this Court permitting the dissemination of material necessary for the use of birth control in the Griswold case would necessarily require a limited discrete opportunity to obtain the materials which are necessary to satisfy the intellectual and emotional needs described in the Stanley case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4784.915" offset="19243029">We would argue that a theater with its curtains drawn down deserves more constitutional protection than a home with its shades drawn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.418" offset="19273017">That one must look at the functional definition of privacy and functionally a theater which is closed is more private than a home which shades are open.</text>

            <text syncTime="4812.736" offset="19354311">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.803" offset="19366536">Very briefly, I choose to touch upon three items which I think have been a part of the appellees argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.486" offset="19421288">The first relates to what I think has been referred to as a novel approach for law enforcement in the field of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.742" offset="19458382">The suggestion is of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.168" offset="19464025">That a customs case in the Second Circuit is one that ought to invite the interest of every state law enforcement official.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.950" offset="19503208">This, I respectfully submit is one aspect or one approach to law enforcement of which I want no part whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.516" offset="19537481">For the first reason, I don’t know how a state could intervene into a federal customs case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.459" offset="19561200">I know of no provision that would entitle any of us who might be States Attorney’s General or District Attorney’s to step into this Court to be ultimately bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.295" offset="19612505">For another reason, I am not prepared anymore than any other individual in this Courtroom to make the assumption that some imported film or other item is obscene or ought to have my supervision immediately on its importation to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.253" offset="19700381">I think first any one of us in law enforcement would have to have an opportunity to make a judgment on the facts would have to see the film as in this case in our jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.072" offset="19759626">It should not be asked either to come in out of curiosity to another jurisdiction or another Court or to come in on notice or in any binding effect of that particular decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.829" offset="19834650">On the contrary, in this particular case, there must have been some assumption to the validity of the particular act which is the showing of the film until there was a contrary decision made and this is exactly what occurred in the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.100" offset="19915734">There was an allegation or complaint and indictment, one single action taken by a qualified law enforcement official of Suffolk County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.285" offset="19956485">There were many arguments and there was a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.488" offset="19969337">There was a trial conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.440" offset="19981145">And this covered a period of five-and-a-half months when the particular film in question showed, when there was no chill whatsoever on any citizen’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.960" offset="20031195">Whether the appellees here or any viewers as far as their opportunity to observe the film “I Am Curious Yellow” which two judges out of three and the Second Circuit Court determined was not obscene.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="5000.038" offset="20103502">General Quinn it’s not entirely clear in my mind as to when this five-and-a half month period came chronologically in this litigation when you say this film was really shown to us?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_quinn" startTime="5014.443" stopTime="5055.193">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Quinn</label>
            <text syncTime="5014.443" offset="20161181">From the beginning of the -- from the Spring of 1969 Mr. Justice Stewart, which I think was probably in May and then an indictment was sought some time around the last week of June by the District Attorney of Suffolk County and there was no -- there was action then taken by the appellees in the federal court but there was no controlling action taken by the federal court nor was there any other action taken by the district attorney of Suffolk County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.241" offset="20276328">Just one single indictment and during the time when these arguments ensued and when the trial on the issue was held in a jury waived session in Suffolk Superior Court, that covered a period of five-and-a-half months.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5055.193" stopTime="5071.832">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="5055.193" offset="20324185">In that period and I understood Mr. Lewin to say, and you would agree, if I understood it correctly that with respect to a moving picture film, there is not just (Inaudible) as contrasted with a book.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_quinn" startTime="5071.832" stopTime="5396.088">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Quinn</label>
            <text syncTime="5071.832" offset="20390745">That is correct, that is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.607" offset="20397850">There is not that remedy available to the prosecutor but there is the remedy of declaratory judgment which was an approach endorsed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in its decision of Commonwealth versus Baird where these First Amendment issues are brought into focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.827" offset="20458663">And there has been other precedent in the Massachusetts Court system for act of approach taken by anyone asserting his individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.566" offset="20509654">So this film showed for five-and-a-half months in the Massachusetts jurisdiction not withstanding the District Attorney of Suffolk County had no opportunity to appear in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.314" offset="20564616">Of course, implicit in this is the fact that we cannot assume that there were any threats on the part of the District Attorney of Suffolk County or the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during this five-and-a-half month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.681" offset="20630131">There were no threats and I further suggest that a threat connotes illegal action on the part of a state law enforcement official.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.194" offset="20676106">Well, there was only one single action taken during this five-and-a-half month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.872" offset="20694810">There has been no action taken by the District Attorney since that period, only the fact that he will not pledge to undergo no further prosecutions, should this film be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.702" offset="20774222">Though there was the forbearance on the part of the appellees here, after the finding and I respectfully submit that after a finding by a Court of competent jurisdiction in Suffolk County that there is obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.755" offset="20822392">That any prosecuting official, any law enforcement official who should take a pledge that he would not move against the film found in fact to be obscene in his jurisdiction would not be upholding his sworn duty to administer the law and to prosecute crime but there was no such statement made only that a change had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.096" offset="20935764">This was after the five-and-a-half month showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.424" offset="20945063">This was after a finding of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.960" offset="20955199">This was after I respectfully submit, a removal of that presumption which must have existed on the part of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.555" offset="20993546">On the basis of the decision, the 2:1 decision in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.544" offset="21013504">I further suggest to this Honorable Court what else is a law enforcement official to do as far as these cases are concerned, if over his shoulder constantly is -- I would not use the threat but is the possibility of federal court intervention in every action that might be under taken by that state law enforcement official in good faith, in the pursuance of his duty?</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.766" offset="21126457">What else is he to do but stand still and I submit, let something now presumptively a crime continued to be perpetuated within his jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.162" offset="21188002">I would further suggest that if we are to remove the very pressing issue of obscenity from determinations by this Court or by any individual citizen, nobody has seriously suggested that I have heard that we not continue to apply the limitations which were mentioned in the provisos in the injunction by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.007" offset="21279431">Those limitations that provided this injunction shall not apply if the picture is advertised in a manner pandering to prurient interest in sex or is shown to an audience not warned of its possibly offensive character, or is shown to children under the age of 18 years, I respectfully submit that more constitutional issues could be raised in any one of these three classifications than I raise in the whole issue of what is obscene and not obscene under the context of definitions of obscenity as outlined by this Court in Roth versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.753" offset="21438360">We would have to wonder what size ad newspaper add was advertising in a manner pandering to prurient interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.150" offset="21467930">We’d have to wonder, if showing the film in Disney Land with all the cautions in the world was nevertheless a failure to warn a possible offensive character.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.542" offset="21517563">We would have to wonder if some young people in these United States who come from, for example, the Mediterranean countries in the heritage as my own wife does, should not be allowed a greater degree of maturity than age 18 or than those individuals of my own heritage who might have come from Northern European countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.278" offset="21616515">No, I hardly think that removing obscenity as proscribed conduct could remove the problems that beset law enforcement officials and this Honorable Court alike in the area of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.284" offset="21680462">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="5421.907" offset="21791013">I think the only thing that I would wish to note on the issue of Griswold versus Connecticut, counsel sought to bring that case to this aid, as certainly of the statute involved in that case where a statute prohibiting birth control clinics, we would be in for much harder time of relying on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.822" offset="21870634">The statute involved in that case was a statute which prohibited married couples from using contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5448.012" offset="21895398">This Court struck down that statute in a prosecution against the directors of the clinics as aiders and abettors under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.547" offset="21933537">And in doing so and used the language that I quoted, the reasoning which had been found not only in that opinion but in ultimately prevailing dissent of Mr. Justice Harlan in Poe versus Ullman and I think again, that that is the central issue in Stanley that the state is invading the Stanley facts, the state is invading a completely private realm.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.792" offset="22034578">Here we are dealing with public conduct and because it is public conduct no matter how carefully guarded it may be, there are at least some sorts of materials which the state may prevent from appearing in the course of that conduct, thank you.</text>
