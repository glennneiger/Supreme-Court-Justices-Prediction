            <label>Mr. Billy H. Nolas</label>
            <text syncTime="6.346" offset="25287">Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.295" offset="37094">Profound mitigating evidence concerning Mr. Rompilla's life history was not heard by the capital sentencing jury in this case because his trial counsel did not secure a single scrap of paper about his life history.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.634" offset="90488">As to the trial prosecutor, his argument, what he elicited from the defense witnesses, and what he presented affirmatively sent the message to this jury of future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.956" offset="135732">When the jury inquired whether in Pennsylvania there is parole from a life sentence, they were not given the simple, straight answer that Pennsylvania law clearly indicates, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.445" offset="181708">Instead, they were told... instead, their question was not answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.626" offset="198426">What I would like to do, unless the Court has specific inquiries, is to make certain points about the ineffectiveness issue and then turn to the sentence issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.783" offset="227056">As to the ineffectiveness issue, Your Honors, this Court has made very clear in Williams v. Taylor, in Wiggins v. Smith, reiterating the concept established originally in Strickland v. Washington, that a trial defense counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough investigation for mitigating evidence in a capital case.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.595" offset="322351">We've seen a number of capital cases, you know... as you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.257" offset="340950">This counsel seemed to me to be quite articulate and... and had a very sound theory of... to argue to the jury for mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.977" offset="383896">It didn't work, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.686" offset="386717">I... I just don't know what constitutional rule you want to ask us for, that you have to look at record evidence?</text>

            <text syncTime="102.719" offset="410854">We are not asking the Court to set a constitutional rule that a capital defense counsel must obtain records in every capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.582" offset="446276">We are asking this Court to apply the rule articulated in Strickland v. Washington itself where the Court indicated that counsel has a duty to make a reasonable investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.136" offset="512522">And as to the experts themselves... and that's actually... the experts and the family are the core of respondent's argument against Mr. Simmons' claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.838" offset="543347">The simplest answer is to look at Wiggins v. Smith where this Court held very clearly that the retention of mental health experts sheds no light on the reasonableness of counsel's life history investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.153" offset="592562">That is especially appropriate in this case because in this case the counsel who had contact with the experts testified very clearly at the post-conviction hearing that the experts were never asked... never asked... to develop life history mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.377" offset="657450">And as my friend, Ms. Zapp, indicates in her brief at page 43, there was no tactical decision in this case by counsel to not pursue life history mitigating evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.742" offset="754939">So would a reasonable person think that's enough to find out family history and... and the concerns that you had?</text>

            <text syncTime="200.118" offset="800392">This Court made very clear in Strickland and Williams and in Wiggins that an assessment of counsel's representation must be done from counsel's perspective at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.910" offset="839576">Counsel's perspective at the time, as Ms. Dantos clearly testified at the hearing, was that the family were not good sources of information for petitioner's life history.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.971" offset="875833">She gave three reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.480" offset="881894">She said, number one, whenever life history was pursued with them, they did not want to deal with it because they thought he was innocent.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.417" offset="1133610">Or as Mr. Charles, the other attorney, put it, these were not the type of family that would provide information when asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.513" offset="1157956">Bear in mind, both of these counsel knew what the respondent's post-conviction rebuttal psychologist testified to, that when you're dealing with abuse, neglect, a dysfunctional home, people don't want to talk about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.117" offset="1308421">You know, as though counsel were planting in the expert's mind what the expert should say.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.187" offset="11124715">Petitioner's ineffectiveness argument seems to be hinging on four things which are the court records in the aggravation case, the charge to the expert, the family members' level of cooperation, and the petitioner's level of cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.081" offset="11180304">But a fair reading of the record demonstrates that counsel was reasonable with respect to all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.783" offset="13687118">You do that investigation because the prior conviction court file may contain information that reduces the weight of the aggravating factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.938" offset="13783667">Indeed, Ms. Zapp quotes at page 41 the 1980 ABA standards that very clearly say, please, for mercy, do not substitute for an actual thorough investigation of mitigating evidence and presentation of mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.711" offset="13842808">And all these lawyers ended up with was an unconnected plea for mercy because they didn't take the steps that reasonable counsel take in a capital case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.971" offset="13979794">And the trial prosecutor says, you could have walked down the hall and gotten it just like I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.414" offset="13997558">That's... that's what's she referring to at page 506.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.945" offset="14011768">As far as the doctors are concerned, I'll just read to Your Honors just from Ms. Dantos herself.</text>
