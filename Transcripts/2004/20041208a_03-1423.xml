Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in Michigan v. Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.089" offset="692349">And that's a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.889" offset="699455">To be sure, there are lots of elements of it, but what my position would be... and obviously the officers' position in this case... is that in exercising unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as you've just described them and none of that is excessive because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than what is necessary in order to achieve complete control under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection of the individual officers and... and candidly of the other individuals who were being... being detained, all four of them, under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.378" offset="841456">My... my basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed that issue in Procunier.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.582" offset="858279">It considered that the qualified immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even though it hadn't been presented in the question presented, and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a... a stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit specifically addressed the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.526" offset="926093">It looked at under Saucier.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.128" offset="932467">It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity was appropriate and... and did the two-part test, the first part being whether it was a constitutional violation and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under these particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.435" offset="977711">So if I... if I cannot persuade you that this is constitutional, which obviously I... I hope I can do, it seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there... that what the officers did here under these circumstances were perfectly reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.996" offset="4031948">When executing a search warrant to investigate a violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate the orderly completion of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.569" offset="4086178">The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.958" offset="4107807">Under the standard for excessive force claims first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers, the degree of force used here was not excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.265" offset="4153051">The same considerations that justified the detention of the occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use of handcuffs during the detention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.405" offset="6153613">In addition to the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers had reason to believe that at least one and possibly two members of a violent gang were living at the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.094" offset="6188304">In addition, the officers had previously visited the house on two occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had encountered resistance on at least one of those occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.533" offset="6226129">And our fundamental problem with the Ninth Circuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers in the course of a detention should really stop and investigate whether or not each... each individual that they encounter poses a safety threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.193" offset="6280673">And we believe that that rule is as unworkable as it is unwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.537" offset="11294093">I... I understand that the facts were more egregious, but the... the Court's analysis for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity standpoint... for a reasonable officer reading that opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.778" offset="11343099">One is that the proper analysis to determine whether handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is... is allowed has to be decided under the kinds of justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham analysis when it comes to force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.006" offset="11415928">And there's lots of cases that... that allow officers to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.958" offset="11427736">Lots of lower court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.160" offset="11432542">In fact, our view is all the lower court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out differently depending on the facts and circumstances confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.583" offset="11466292">The second thing, the... the point about the disabled person and the particular facts made that case particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those were additional factors, not the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.391" offset="11513522">The Ninth Circuit didn't say that the constitutional standard was particularly abusive or egregious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.795" offset="11539122">It... it applied traditional Fourth Amendment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.412" offset="11549571">And finally and I think very important and not dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is that the Ninth Circuit in... in Franklin rejected a blanket handcuffing policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.768" offset="11595024">That's what the policy was in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.154" offset="11604532">The Portland police department had a policy that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.160" offset="11632640">And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that kind of policy because Summers and... and Graham require it to be individualized justification for that... for an additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's allowed in Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.484" offset="11689900">And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing to what it... to... to the circumstances in Dunaway, to... to circumstances that start to look like an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.762" offset="11751027">And I don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what these officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of the... the issues here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.965" offset="12175778">And she was made to sit by there and she was very cold and uncomfortable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.317" offset="12189257">And she did complain that the handcuffs were too tight and she complained that they were uncomfortable and could they be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.737" offset="12214857">It's not a garage in... in the way that the vision of it, but also if you look at it, it's... and the... the jury did look at it because it had a videotape of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.278" offset="12261042">You could see that the... the occupants were made to be in a very uncomfortable situation that was unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.968" offset="12299807">And that... that was clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit certainly under Franklin that the manner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or painful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit as of 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.695" offset="12370756">I think in the Heitschmidt case, which is very similar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after the search, but applied the same reasoning to a 1994 search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.987" offset="12411925">You had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-suspect as to whom the... the officers didn't have that... that kind of... of suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.193" offset="12456751">And the Fifth Circuit found that that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.782" offset="12483082">So from our standpoint, on the issue of being detained past the time, I think it's just a clear case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.138" offset="12520490">I think the other side has conceded that if... if there's this evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment has to be affirmed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.808" offset="12551210">On... on the handcuffing issue, we believe the same principle has to apply because the facts have to be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and when you view those facts, I... it... it is... no reasonable officer would believe you could do those things to Ms. Mena in these circumstances based on the law at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.757" offset="12642952">And I think that it would be... what the... what the United States and... and what petitioners' counsel is asking for is really for a radical change of law themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.715" offset="12682762">We're happy with Summers and Graham and the way that applies, and the... the jury instruction was based on... on Summers and Graham and on Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.003" offset="12719961">The language is taken directly from those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.522" offset="12729992">And... and the... the jury in a case like this... qualified immunity obviously provides some protection for... for officers that when... when a reasonable officer wouldn't know these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.949" offset="12791745">But jury verdicts also play a crucial role in a civil rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.501" offset="12809927">In this case, a jury of our community found that Iris Mena had been subjected to an abuse of... a specific abuse of authority in being held beyond the time of... of the search, even at a time when the prime target was... was free to go about his business with a citation, and was held in these painful handcuffs for a period of over 2 hours in circumstances where, in the totality of the circumstances, she was treated much more harshly than anything this Court, I think, contemplated in the Summers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.870" offset="12935419">And I think that officers know how to... officers know how to handle the Fourth Amendment issues involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.209" offset="12964780">They don't need a special rule because that rule would end up meaning that when you go in and you don't find what you're afraid of, that everybody is still going to be subjected to this kind of serious intrusion on their individual liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.486" offset="13029878">And so we would urge the Court not to go down this new path that the United States and the petitioners are asking and to affirm the judgment because it was based on clearly established principles that this Court and other courts around the country have... have established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.746" offset="13094975">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.684" offset="13126635">I want to start with essentially the question that Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that the questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty in the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment on an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any individual detainee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.448" offset="13217750">Those are rulings that I submit to you are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that basis alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.037" offset="13244082">At that stage, if the respondent wants to argue to the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact, proved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but understand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative ground that there were 15 minutes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.880" offset="13311478">The Ninth Circuit expressly never... or didn't expressly but never said one word about a period of time after the search ended in this particular case, and that's not an accident because there is no testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.556" offset="13362155">The officer said he didn't remember and when asked, well, would 10 to 15 minutes be consistent with your memory, well, of course, it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.377" offset="13389427">He didn't remember anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.354" offset="13657339">So if the district court got it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.358" offset="13689417">In other words, if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district judge that behaved... gave a proper charge, then the Ninth Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with what the district court and the jury decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.588" offset="13770292">Well, the... the court of appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that we should... we were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.961" offset="13803833">The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.265" offset="13829016">The fact that neither of those withstand serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a basis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the matter to go back at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.287" offset="13865064">And... and that is exactly what this Court does in... you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.208" offset="13888784">Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive damages cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.143" offset="13900487">Juries make punitive damages determinations every day and every day courts of appeals and trial judges review those damages awards de novo because they... because the question is not just what are the historical facts... that you give deference to the jury on... but on the fundamental question of what is the rule of law that will govern the police officers in the execution of search warrants in circumstances like this.</text>
