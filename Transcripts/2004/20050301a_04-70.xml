            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="16.225" offset="64888">Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.062" offset="80248">This Court 32 years ago in Zahn v. International Paper affirmed that a class action could not proceed under 28 U.S.C., section 1332, the diversity statute, if it was clear that some of the unnamed members of that class do not satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.093" offset="156317">The question in this case is whether Congress in 1990 overturned this Court's ruling in Zahn and its interpretation of section 1332 not by amending section 1332 but, instead, by enacting a supplemental jurisdiction statute, section 1367.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.637" offset="226534">The answer to that question, Your Honors, is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.609" offset="238341">Plaintiffs in the lower courts that have felt constrained to conclude that the language of section 1367 requires the conclusion that Zahn and, candidly, also this Court's decision in Strawbridge were overruled by 1367 do so by gliding past the express language in 1367(a) that is the primary basis upon which our argument stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.592" offset="334367">In the appendix 246a to the petition, there's... the central language is in (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="91.577" offset="366237">It says, in any civil action, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.595" offset="386299">That language by its terms and... clearly indicates that Congress did not mean to make any adjustments in the background law that exists that defined diversity jurisdiction or Federal court jurisdiction, Federal question jurisdiction as a condition to going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.997" offset="463935">So what the Congress says is, look at the law as it exists in 1990, as it's been interpreted by this Court, and then determine whether or not there's Federal jurisdiction, either for diversity or Federal question, and if there is, then you proceed forth from that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.972" offset="527882">And what we know is that there are two situations that will not satisfy original jurisdiction under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.084" offset="552333">The first one is in the Zahn situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.396" offset="561528">Where you have both satisfying and unsatisfying plaintiffs in the unnamed... who are in the unnamed members of the class, this Court said you cannot proceed forth under the diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.552" offset="618162">The second one is the classic sort of joinder situation, and what the Court held in Strawbridge is that simply because you have a plaintiff who satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement and satisfies the complete diversity requirement does not mean that you're allowed to join under rule 20 an additional plaintiff who does not satisfy both of those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.954" offset="695798">And if you bring someone in under those circumstances, that defeats jurisdiction at the beginning before you ever took to trying to decide what the scope of section 1367(a) and (b) mean from that point forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.700" offset="750759">So then the question is, if that's the correct interpretation of 1367(a)'s predicate language, then what work does 1367(a) and 1367(b) do, and does our interpretation do any violence to the structure of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.570" offset="814184">And the answer to that is clearly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.328" offset="821290">Here we start by looking at what was Congress' clear intent, manifested primarily in the last language of 1367(a), where it says supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.445" offset="877714">Here--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="220.188" offset="880744">Mr. Phillips, before you proceed to going on to (b), the... you have set up a dichotomy between a Federal question case where, as long as you have a Federal question claim in the case, you qualify within those words, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.309" offset="989205">But you say that in a diversity case, that's not so if you have people not of the same citizenship... of the same citizenship on both sides of the party line, so that you have to have a totally qualifying action on the diversity side to come within... to... to be within 1367(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="271.169" offset="1084604">But we have had at least two cases where the starting lineup did not satisfy the complete diversity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.489" offset="1125878">One was Caterpillar and the other was Newman-Green, and the Court said, yes, on the day one there wasn't complete diversity, but that's curable later on, in the one case before the case was tried, in the other in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.693" offset="1198707">So don't at least those two cases suggest that you can have a diversity case legitimately in the Federal court even though at the outset you don't have... fill all the requirements?</text>

            <text syncTime="316.040" offset="1264118">--I... I don't think that's the right conclusion to draw from those cases, Justice Ginsburg, because what happened is by the time that... those cases got to this Court, the jurisdictional problems had been solved and the Court was faced with a question... with what I perceive to be purely a remedial question, is what do you do in terms of trying to put the omelette back into the egg at that point when the litigation has gone forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.352" offset="1345306">And the Court, as a matter of judicial efficiency, decided essentially to ignore the jurisdictional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.553" offset="1366204">Here, by contrast, this jurisdictional problem existed on day one, and the complaint was filed--</text>

            <text syncTime="369.007" offset="1476023">That's... that's what this Court said specifically in... in Zahn itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.920" offset="1495667">It said the problem is that you cannot simply go forward with the Federal claim and with the State claims in that... in that format.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.091" offset="1636310">And what I'm proposing to you is this Court has never ignored the jurisdictional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.262" offset="1653029">It always solves the jurisdictional problem somehow, whether it dismisses the case, as it did in... in Grupo Dataflux, whether it dismisses the case, as it... as it proposed would have to happen in Zahn if they didn't excise one of the parties, or whether it makes an adjustment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.355" offset="4513332">I have three basic points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.056" offset="4524199">First, section 1367 does not alter the requirements of section 1332 for original jurisdiction in a civil diversity action, and therefore, the plain language of section 1367 does not alter the complete diversity requirement or the requirement that each plaintiff in a diversity action must have more than $75,000 in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.010" offset="4632033">Second, there is no sound basis for distinguishing between the two jurisdictional requirements of section 1332, and therefore, if section 1367 alters the matter-in-controversy rule of Zahn and Clark, it also alters the complete diversity rule of Strawbridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.306" offset="4713221">And third, the best interpretation of section 1367 and the one that causes the least harm is that it overturns the result in Finley and otherwise, with a few exceptions, codifies the pre-Finley understanding of supplemental jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.003" offset="4787931">Now, our... our primary argument has already been addressed, and I don't want to waste time on it but it is crucial, critical to our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.034" offset="4828056">And that is, that the language of 1367(a) is that supplemental jurisdiction is conferred but only in a civil action, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.243" offset="7256921">There are a number of cases that are actually cited in the Court's opinion in Owen Equipment, and they give a sort of brief summary of these situations in which you could actually bring in extra parties and claims in a diversity case and the extra parties or claims would not be satisfying complete diversity or matter-in-controversy, and yet the original jurisdiction of section 1332 would not be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.371" offset="7361411">Footnote 18 of Owen Equipment cites one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.252" offset="7376980">It's called Scott against Fancher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.110" offset="7384398">It was a Fifth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.596" offset="7390354">There was an accident with three trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.196" offset="7400699">One of the drivers was from Texas and the other two were from Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.110" offset="7420343">So the... their case was brought in Texas against the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.971" offset="7443853">The Texas drivers sued the two Oklahoma drivers, so there was complete diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.057" offset="7460153">It did meet the matter-in-controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.832" offset="7467259">So one defendant filed a compulsory counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.579" offset="7486276">That was one of the examples, and this is all mentioned in Owen Equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.801" offset="7499128">And that was okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.946" offset="7507696">Of course, the citizenship would be the same, but no question about whether the amount in controversy was... was up to the required level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.460" offset="7537789">And they also filed a... a cross claim against the other defendant, and that was also allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.641" offset="7566524">And again, no... of course, now you have two citizens from Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.067" offset="7580212">So that would not be complete diversity, but that... that was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.154" offset="7596513">And again, it's because the defendants are bringing in... this is the language that the Court used in Owen Equipment, that when a defendant is hailed into court against its will, then some of these ancillary claims are going to be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.533" offset="8226064">It really doesn't go to whether the court has jurisdiction over the civil action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2069.536" offset="8278100">And... and here we would rely on statutory language, and it's the language of section of 1332, which sets out the two requirements for original jurisdiction of a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.591" offset="8326269">Strawbridge is an interpretation of that requirement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2286.670" offset="9146619">Well, in... in the class action context... and again, my case is not a class action... I frankly can't explain how you reconcile Ben Hur and Zahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.639" offset="9178488">I think those... the cases... for the same... if... if the rationale of Ben Hur is that the class members are not really parties in the full sense and so we don't need to worry about their citizenship, I would think you could make the same type of argument as to matter-in-controversy that as long as the representatives satisfy it, they're the parties in the full or true sense and so that's all that counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.756" offset="9270962">But the Court decided Zahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.985" offset="9279843">There was really no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.593" offset="9286322">Congress never indicated that it had any... any difficulties with that decision, and it's now well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.311" offset="9317146">And I think... the final point I'd just make very briefly is that if you were to interpret 1367 to have this broad effect of opening up diversity actions to unlimited joinder of plaintiffs, nondiverse plaintiffs, plaintiffs with... who don't have the requisite amount in controversy, it... it really would be absurd, not in the sense that doing that on its own is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.317" offset="9457267">I don't contend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.349" offset="9461342">But it... it is not... it would not be rational for Congress to go to all this trouble that it went to in subsection (b) to rule out all these sort of indirect situations where the plaintiffs leave out a party in the initial complaint and then wait for the party to come in some other way... I mean, things that frankly are not likely to happen in a lot of cases... but then say, oh, but the... the doors are... are wide open under rule 20, bring in as many plaintiffs as you want right at the outset or later on if you'd prefer, don't worry about diversity, don't worry about the amount in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.257" offset="9596970">Those two things just... just don't go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.008" offset="9607941">There are... there are other things about subsection (b) that don't make good sense under the petitioner's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.674" offset="9642632">I mean, for example, this is just one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.532" offset="9650051">If you just look at the language of subsection (b), it says you shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under... a list of rules... and then one of them is rule 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.271" offset="9708983">Well, whenever you have more than one defendant in a case just named in the complaint, you use rule 20 get in more than one defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.135" offset="9748480">So read literally, that says if you had this broad view, plaintiffs can bring in as many additional plaintiffs as they like under rule 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.712" offset="9786828">But on the defendant's side, as soon as you've got a second defendant in the case, suddenly all this supplemental jurisdiction goes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.256" offset="9820996">Now, that makes sense under our view because plaintiffs are not supposed to be asserting these kinds of claims anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.995" offset="9843879">Whether there's one defendant or two, it's the rationale of Owen Equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.679" offset="9890691">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.106" offset="9904379">I believe what's at stake here is whether this Court was serious in the Finley decision, and it's interesting that it was a 5 to 4 decision, in which four of you concluded that pendent party jurisdiction was a logical extension of Gibbs and five among you concluded that it was not up for this Court to make that determination, that only Congress could make that determination, and in the 200 years of history of the Federal courts that had preceded Finley, that the track record of this Court and the lower courts in expanding Federal jurisdiction had been a rocky one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.230" offset="10064875">But you weren't going to do it anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.171" offset="10072607">Now, that wasn't the first time this Court had said those words, we're not going to do it anymore, but it was said in a way that got somebody's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.747" offset="10110955">And if there was a surprise, it was within a year Congress did precisely what you asked them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.973" offset="10139794">They adopted 1367, and they did it in the way that Congress does things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.750" offset="10162991">It's better not to watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.541" offset="10170096">They don't necessarily explain it carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.375" offset="10181486">They don't do it in an organized and comprehensive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.180" offset="10192666">It is a matter that was of great interest to a small number of people and of no interest to the great body politic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.339" offset="10221296">Let's face it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.816" offset="10223177">Diversity jurisdiction is of great interest to you and me; it's of little interest to the people until they're hauled into court and find that only part of their case can be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.187" offset="10260689">And when we look at the history of Federal jurisprudence, what do we see?</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.357" offset="10277407">We see that the history of this Court has been largely to allow defendants hauled into court to ignore rules that we once thought were sacrosanct, for example, the notion of destruction of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.680" offset="10334668">And in law school we all learned about destruction of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.531" offset="10346057">It doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.138" offset="10352536">When a defendant is brought into court, we ignore Strawbridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.120" offset="10368418">We did because this Court and other circuit courts said you could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.106" offset="10384405">And incidentally, when they're brought into court, they're brought into the same civil action as any plaintiff or defendant in the original complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.398" offset="10437590">Any claim, Your Honor, that's brought in in a third party practice, any claim that's brought in an additional party claim is part of the same civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.853" offset="10475311">There's only one form of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.461" offset="10481789">All the claims are in that one form of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.311" offset="10493179">The importance of this, incidentally, is that their entire argument depends on interpretation of the two words, civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.721" offset="10530795">Does the district court have original jurisdiction over a civil action if the civil action includes claims over which there's clearly original jurisdiction and claims where there is not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.618" offset="10582413">Now, historically... incidentally, Exxon has to basically make new law, and they do it by saying that Zahn stands for the proposition that there's no jurisdiction over a class action which includes smaller claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.803" offset="10639151">I... I dare you to read Zahn and find those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.185" offset="10652735">They don't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.383" offset="10657437">All Zahn says, all Snyder said, which preceded it, is that every class member's claim must be viewed individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.125" offset="10696411">Now, that's a very interesting conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.438" offset="10705711">In other words, it doesn't say there's no jurisdiction over the class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.494" offset="10717936">It simply says the claims of the absent class members who don't meet the jurisdictional amount should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.098" offset="10744372">Now, interesting, look at the language in 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.018" offset="10760046">It says the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.785" offset="10807066">Well, when we read that statute and we apply Zahn and Snyder, we say civil action doesn't mean the aggregate of all claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.791" offset="10839144">There we say what it means is we must evaluate each individual claim to determine if each individual claim within the civil action meets the jurisdictional minimum of the diversity statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3774.817" offset="15099193">We have a little bit different view I think of the statute than the other counsel arguing this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.640" offset="15122495">We... we believe that the statute actually makes quite a lot of sense, and we also believe emphatically that it does not reverse the complete diversity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.390" offset="15157499">I think the clearest indication of the incorrectness of Mr. Phillips' and Mr. Long's position is the comparative treatment under their reading of the Federal question case that is in Federal court and the diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.532" offset="15222073">Under their reading, it's perfectly clear... and I think everyone agrees... that... that when additional claims, as in the City of Chicago case, are joined with a Federal question case and they are... they relate to the same subject matter, that it will, in fact... they will be within the supplemental jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.024" offset="15296052">Most importantly, for purposes of this comparison, they will not destroy the original jurisdiction over a civil action even though they are claims that are not themselves within the original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.399" offset="15349551">Somehow or other, the argument is advanced that when you have a diversity case in Federal court where all parties are diverse and there is the jurisdictional amount satisfied and you bring in other parties who do not destroy complete diversity and therefore do not destroy the jurisdiction of the court over the initial matter that was before it... somehow or other the argument is advanced that the jurisdiction over the civil action in that situation is destroyed even though it is not destroyed in the Federal--</text>

            <text syncTime="3949.886" offset="15799484">The... the question... I think the difference is that the concept of complete diversity, which this Court for 200 years has articulated as in the statute that grants diversity jurisdiction is a relational concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.972" offset="15851833">In order to determine whether you have jurisdiction over any parties in a case, you must look at all of the parties in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.403" offset="15881509">With regard to amount in controversy, it's perfectly clear, and... and 1367 changes nothing about the fact that 1332 jurisdiction requires meeting the amount in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.809" offset="15939187">But if 1367 has conferred, as it has, supplemental, additional jurisdiction, then the question that has to be asked is, does the fact that a party coming in with what is otherwise a supplemental claim... does... does the presence of that party destroy the original jurisdiction that exists where the new party coming in is diverse but doesn't meet the jurisdictional amount?</text>

            <text syncTime="4075.754" offset="16302916">The Court said, with no difficulty, both for purposes of 1367 and for purposes of 1441, that is a case within the original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.535" offset="16342100">It's a civil action.</text>

            <text syncTime="4097.341" offset="16389329">This Court has many, many decisions and many other courts have many decisions saying emphatically that when you add a party or when there is a party in a case who destroys complete diversity, the court loses jurisdiction over the entire matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.688" offset="16454740">To my knowledge, the last time the Court said it as a holding was in the Schacht case a few years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.600" offset="16474384">There are, I think, dozens of cases from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.162" offset="16484624">We cite about five of them on page 24 and 25 of our blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.453" offset="16501760">That is a fundamental principle and it is because the concept of complete diversity is a relational concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.545" offset="16534152">It depends on who the parties are in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.024" offset="16544078">As has been said many times, the requirement of amount in controversy is individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.430" offset="16565708">The fact that a party submits a complaint and the complaint has one party, as in our case, whose claim comes within the diversity jurisdiction and includes other parties who we agree their claims do not come within the original jurisdiction... does the fact that those claims are all put on the same piece of paper, put on a complaint, does that mean the court, the trial court, lacks jurisdiction over the first claim as to which all the requirements are met?</text>

            <text syncTime="4457.326" offset="17829303">And... and I would just like to go on and say one other thing, and that is, this Court has written how many hundreds I don't know, but hundreds of cases articulating nuances... and... and I've learned how remarkable they are, the nuances... of law under 1332 and under what amounts to a case within... it's incredible how complex the law that this Court has spelled out is under 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.974" offset="17915820">Our view of the statute is that that body of law has been preserved and it's been preserved in two places.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.478" offset="17941838">It has been preserved in the first clause of 1367(a), which is really all that's at issue right here, and it's also been... been preserved in the last clause of 1367(b) which says that... that as to the list of enumerated exceptions... in essence, (b) says if you've got a case within the original jurisdiction, then it says, with regard to plaintiffs' claims against parties joined under 14, 19, 20, and 24 and with regard to claims brought by persons to be joined under 19 or 24, then you don't have supplemental jurisdiction if to do so would be inconsistent with the requirements of jurisdiction under 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.626" offset="18110485">What does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.824" offset="18115291">That means that those excepted claims may not come in if they could not have been brought in the case originally without destroying original jurisdiction under 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.570" offset="18170253">It can't possibly mean, as our opponents I think read it, that the only time you have supplemental jurisdiction over these claims is when you already have 1332 jurisdiction over these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.292" offset="18217064">That isn't supplemental jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.438" offset="18225737">It would make absolutely no sense to read the statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.493" offset="18237962">So how do we read it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.525" offset="18242038">We read it to say if these are claims whose presence in the case at the beginning would have destroyed the anchor that gets us into court, which is a case under 1332, then the whole thing goes out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.066" offset="18296163">And furthermore, I would say... and again, this is not an easy point to spell out in all of its nuances, but at any point in the case, which will not be many and won't be often... but at any point in the case where this Court's cases would say that you just lost jurisdiction under 1332... and I say that's not often because basically there's a time of filing rule and there are many, many, as you all know better than I... there are many nuances as to what exceptions exist to that and what don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.847" offset="18407340">But the bottom line is if the case falls out of 1332 jurisdiction, such as when the clever plaintiff tries to join a rule 20 compadre to come in and bring a nondiverse claim, goodbye.</text>

            <text syncTime="4752.170" offset="19008679">One thing I would like to do before... before the light goes off here is... is talk a little bit about the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.575" offset="19030204">And of course, our position first... in the first instance is that there really isn't any reason to consider it because this is not a statute that destroys complete diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.461" offset="19061760">It doesn't do anything radical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.697" offset="19066776">It actually is quite sensible and limited and clear when you read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.642" offset="19090495">So we don't think you need to go to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.922" offset="19095615">But if the Court is going to go to it, we would submit that there is a far more sensible way of thinking about the legislative history than grabbing one sentence out of the House report, which I'll talk about in a minute as to what significance it really has anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.815" offset="19159249">But essentially the sequence of events here... and I'll try to go through it quickly... is that you... and as Mr. Stearns said, you have basically three versions of this... of this enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.756" offset="19202926">The last one got tweaked a little bit at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.189" offset="19212748">The first version is the... is the subcommittee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.821" offset="19227272">And as he indicated, the subcommittee report, which actually appears at page 14 and 15 of our brief, of our yellow brief... if you read the text of (a), which appears on page 14, what you see is language which on its face clearly does reverse Zahn, and then you have the commentary that went with it in the working papers to the subcommittee, and that commentary could not have been more emphatic of... of the intent to reverse Zahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.390" offset="19341479">The second enactment, which we have put in an addendum to our yellow brief because it, frankly, plays little role in the case in... in thinking through the statute, is the section 120 of House Resolution 5381.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.629" offset="19398426">And essentially when Congress... it's quite correct that the Federal Courts Study Committee did not specifically endorse the subcommittee proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.688" offset="19426743">It passed it along, saying it wasn't taking a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.306" offset="19437192">When it got to Congress, from somewhere a new enactment came forward onto the floor or onto the committee that was addressing it, and that's this provision in the addendum of our yellow brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.351" offset="19481391">And all I'm going to say about that is that when you look at that, number one, it looks entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.809" offset="19499154">Number two, it actually does a much poorer job of preserving complete diversity, and it does, in fact, explicitly overrule Owen Equipment v. Kroger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.924" offset="19539696">Judge Weis came in and testified and said, that's bad, don't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.806" offset="19555161">You know, you've got to show more respect for complete diversity, and... and you shouldn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.107" offset="19576372">That got put into the ash can.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.615" offset="19582433">So that's the end of 120.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.555" offset="19590165">And the next thing he did, attached to his same testimony, was... was submit a proposal, which is in our yellow brief at page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.440" offset="19621721">And this... this is what we said we think you should enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.065" offset="19640216">If you compare the language of (a) with the language of (a) in the enactment on page 14, you will see that it's a couple lines longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.360" offset="19673339">It has a few more embellishments and words, but it is substantively indistinguishable, the provision in (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.472" offset="19697789">And so what we have is Judge Weis putting forward a proposal that can't be substantively distinguished from the one that the subcommittee said, clearly correctly, would reverse Zahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.079" offset="19740212">The last question here is what happened then, and what happened then to provision (a)... there are essentially three things that happened to this whole provision that I'm aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.807" offset="19775216">One is they took out the words, on a claim, and that's the argument that's principally advanced here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.917" offset="19799667">They took those.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.510" offset="19801966">So it's civil action on a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.063" offset="19808235">They took out on a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.095" offset="19812310">They also changed the last clause of (b) and they also changed the reference in the supplemental jurisdiction from case or... from... what is the... the transaction or occurrence to case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.039" offset="19872078">And those are all the changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.070" offset="19876258">We would submit that there is no basis to infer from any of those things, and particularly not the first one that dealt with (a), that they meant by dropping on a claim to somehow say, oh, my goodness, you've got to have jurisdiction over all of the claims before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.271" offset="19932996">Again, that is inconsistent with the Court's opinion in City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.358" offset="19949401">You can't come out the same way in City of Chicago if the presence of a nonjurisdictional claim destroys original jurisdiction over the civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.017" offset="19988062">The last thing I... I want to say about the... the jurisdiction which the other side relies upon... essentially it's a sentence that says there was no intent to, quote, affect the jurisdictional requirements of 1332 in diversity-only class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.160" offset="20052637">And then there's a cite, a footnote to Zahn and Ben Hur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.162" offset="20068624">That's pretty much what there is that they talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.968" offset="20079804">Well, number one, as has been said, the authors... apparently the authors of that language, the ones who put it in conceded that this legislative history was an attempt to correct an oversight in the statute, which it would have been better to have corrected in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.995" offset="20139886">We think that's significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.110" offset="20144379">But I would go beyond that and say that if you just look at this language, no... no intent to affect the jurisdictional requirements of 1332 in diversity-only class actions, number one, most importantly, we don't think there's been a change in the requirements under 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.520" offset="20218044">As I've said before, this statute engrafted this Court's entire body of 1332 jurisprudence in the first line of... of clause (a) and in the last line of clause (b), and so it's all there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.689" offset="20270707">No one has changed 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.546" offset="20278126">This is supplemental jurisdiction additional to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.353" offset="20289411">And secondly, this is not a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.748" offset="20298919">There's nothing in our case that relates to a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.008" offset="20311980">That's an issue, if you think this is relevant, you have to deal with in... in the other case, but you don't have to deal with it in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.870" offset="20335386">I guess the last thing I would say about legislative history is that we think probably the most important legislative history here, other than the tracking of these provisions, which we think is quite indicative, is... is that the... the House report, among other things, also said that what they were trying to do was to provide, quote, a practical arena for the resolution of an entire controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.647" offset="20430576">And we think that in the context of our case, as... as has been pointed out here already by Justice Ginsburg, it makes very little sense to resolve our case by splitting it in two and sending it to different courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.011" offset="20471954">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="5118.754" offset="20474984">Thank you, Mr. Ayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.462" offset="20481776">Mr. Phillips, you have another 4 minutes, and I see that will be adjournment time, I will let everyone else know.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="5127.709" stopTime="5272.973">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="5127.709" offset="20510824">Thank... thank you, Justice Stevens, and I'd just like to make a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.896" offset="20527543">First of all, Justice Kennedy, you asked about the City of Chicago case, and Justice Ginsburg said this sort of feels like a Finley type case in the... in... in how it applies in the diversity context.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.107" offset="20572369">But the fundamental point here is that there is a very different approach and there has always been a very different approach to Federal question jurisdiction and to diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.108" offset="20608418">Federal question jurisdiction has always been claims-driven.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.284" offset="20621061">Diversity jurisdiction has always been party-driven.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.274" offset="20633078">And the Congress that enacted 1367 in 1990 had to have understood that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.253" offset="20652931">It's been the law for as long as... as we've had... for the 200 years that Strawbridge has been around, that distinction has... has existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.631" offset="20686472">And so we're not asking the Court to interpret civil action differently in this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.728" offset="20706847">We're asking the Court to focus on civil actions of which the district court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.374" offset="20725447">That incorporates all of the requirements of 1331 and 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.409" offset="20745613">Second, Justice Breyer, I'm a little reluctant to get into this rule 19, rule 24 to try... but I think I can help at least clarify at least some aspects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.346" offset="20773303">Rule 19 by its terms excludes situations that defeat jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.548" offset="20794096">So it says in the rule that if you're bringing in a necessary party... remember, this is the defendant who is bringing in a necessary party... if it would defeat jurisdiction, you can't do it, and if it still is indispensable, you have to dismiss the entirety of the case, which is precedent for the notion that sometimes you have to dismiss the entirety of the case in situations where you don't have jurisdiction over a particular party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.610" offset="20874344">But the... the second question, rule 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.189" offset="20892735">I think the standard is that you could bring in a rule 24 party within supplemental jurisdiction that doesn't defeat anything with respect to the original civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.743" offset="20930873">I think that was the rule prior to 1367.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.533" offset="20942054">But to the extent it was or wasn't, I think 1367(a) and (b) combine to allow that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.651" offset="20962534">(b) then says that if someone intervenes as a party, the plaintiff cannot bring a claim against that... that intervening party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.588" offset="20990328">Justice Souter, you asked about the different treatment between the amount-in-controversy requirement and the geography requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.904" offset="21015615">If there is a distinction... and I don't think this provision allows any kind of meaningful distinction between the two as it applies in the 1367 context... it is that the amount-in-controversy requirement is more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.678" offset="21058664">That's what Zahn held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.997" offset="21063889">You can dispense with the geography requirement in Ben Hur, but you cannot dispense with the amount-in-controversy requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.685" offset="21090638">And the reason--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="5272.973" stopTime="5274.459">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="5272.973" offset="21091892">This didn't make a whole lot of sense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="5274.459" stopTime="5326.472">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="5274.459" offset="21097744">--Well, except it does because the... the amount-in-controversy requirement keeps a lot of smaller cases out of Federal court that otherwise would be in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.633" offset="21130449">It is a protection of this Court's docket and all the Federal courts' dockets, and that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.546" offset="21150093">And that's also a distinction between the Federal question cases and the diversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.882" offset="21167438">If you resolve diversity in favor of driving cases to State court, you are promoting federalism interests because State courts should decide law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.230" offset="21196904">If you drive more cases into Federal courts under Federal question, that's right because you think Federal courts are, in general, better suited to resolve Federal courts... Federal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.722" offset="21234834">And then finally, with respect to the remedy, Justice Ginsburg, Newman-Green says you can simply excise some parties if there is no prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.565" offset="21274227">And what I submit to you is we have a case that has been litigated from day one without jurisdiction involving more than 1,000 plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="5326.472" offset="21305887">That... this point was not... would be you're asking us to decide it in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.440" offset="21337757">You, I would expect, make argument to the district judge when you go back.</text>

            <text syncTime="5340.301" offset="21361162">Well, except that this Court in Dataflux didn't send it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.798" offset="21371089">This Court in Dataflux decided that the right... in Grupo Dataflux that the right answer is that the remedy for this mistake is the dismissal certainly of the class, but I think frankly the dismissal of the entirety of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5353.183" offset="21412676">Well, that's because the Court conceived of there... there being one entity, so you couldn't... you couldn't change... split that one entity into two fictitious persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="5365.898" offset="21463562">Well, that's... and that's what the district court held in Zahn, which is the reason the district court didn't allow this case to come... didn't allow this to go forward as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.296" offset="21489162">And that's important to remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.328" offset="21493238">This Court didn't say you dismiss out anything in Zahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.589" offset="21506299">Zahn came up without it being a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.068" offset="21516225">The district court dismissed the class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.758" offset="21523017">It came up trying to reinstate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.161" offset="21528555">This Court said you can't reinstate it.</text>
