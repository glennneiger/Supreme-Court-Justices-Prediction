            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have an opinion to announce it was authored by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.388" offset="17450">The case is Tenet against Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.401" offset="29571">Respondent husband and wife claimed to spied on behalf of the United States during the Cold War and they alleged that the CIA promised in return to provide them with assistance for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.803" offset="83174">Asserting that the CIA failed to carry out its end of the bargain respondents filed suit in Federal Court against the United States and the Director of the CIA seeking to require the CIA to give them assistance and to provide an internal review process that accords with a due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.803" offset="163109">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that their claims based on due process and the estoppel theories could proceed to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.928" offset="195709">We granted certiorari and now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.747" offset="210965">More than a century ago in Totten against the United States we held that the executor of a self-styled Civil War spy could not sue the United States to enforce his obligations under a secret espionage agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.878" offset="275435">We held that the very essence of such an agreement was such that it was secret and had to remain so.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.098" offset="304379">We thought it entirely incompatible with the secret nature of such a contract that a former spy could bring suit to enforcer.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.106" offset="340323">Totten plainly bars respondents' suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.197" offset="352758">Totten did not merely prohibit breach of contract claims brought by former spies to enforce secret contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.288" offset="381074">Leaving open the possibility for individuals to bring claims under alternative theories such as estoppel or due process, Totten more sweepingly forbid the maintenance of any claim such as respondents' where success depends upon the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.235" offset="456934">The Court of Appeals also was wrong to hold that Totten has been recast simply as an expression of the evidentiary states secret privilege rather than a categorical bar to respondents' claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.707" offset="510746">Although we have looked the Totten in developing that privilege, none of our cases has signaled to retreat from Totten's holding that lawsuit premise on alleged espionage agreement are all together forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.694" offset="566753">Today we adhere to Totten, the states secrets privilege in the more frequent use of in camera judicial proceeding simply cannot provide the absolute protection we found necessary in enunciating the Totten rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.263" offset="620983">The possibility that an espionage relationship maybe revealed if a suit proceeds is unacceptable and requiring the government to invoke the privilege on a case by case basis risks the perception that is confirming or denying relationships with individual plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.117" offset="696424">Enforcing the government to litigate these claims could expose the government to lawsuits brought just to induce the CIA to settle the case in order to avoid revealing classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.944" offset="743758">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.722" offset="758805">The opinion of the Court authored by the Chief Justice is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.118" offset="776464">I have filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Ginsburg join; Justice Scalia has also filed a concurring opinion.</text>
