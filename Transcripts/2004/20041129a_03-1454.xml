            <text syncTime="6.623" offset="26436">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.771" offset="39079">Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs with the potential for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.067" offset="72202">And with respect to Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully controlled confines of federally approved research programs.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="36.136" offset="144509">Well, Mr. Clement, the... I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="58.841" stopTime="80.556">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="58.841" offset="235311">Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.105" offset="308349">And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy did so, as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.556" offset="322142">Well, but in Wickard, of course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his wheat did, in part, go in the national market.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.682" offset="358713">You don't have that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.640" offset="366550">As I understand it, if California's law applies, then none of this home-grown or medical-use marijuana will be on any interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.258" offset="420989">And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.850" offset="443350">So how do you distinguish Morrison?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.832" offset="455262">And how do you distinguish Lopez?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="116.648" stopTime="142.357">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="116.648" offset="466547">Well, Justice O'Connor, let me first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with California law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.530" offset="514090">And, of course, the Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and from controlled substances under Schedule I into the national market.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="142.357" offset="569365">Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law?</text>
            <text syncTime="148.385" offset="593502">I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="155.339" offset="621296">Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any reason to assume that California is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.877" offset="671451">And I think Congress, here, made important findings that you've alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress' words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that have traveled on interstate commerce.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="187.935" stopTime="202.125">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="187.935" offset="751700">Well, General Clement, what if we were to assume... I'm not saying this is... that the District Court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had... say they made such findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.258" offset="796944">Would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="202.125" offset="808438">I think you would say they were relevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="205.315" offset="821185">But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="208.756" stopTime="216.171">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="208.756" offset="834978">--Well, because I think it is a reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question... I think that in... obviously, in all of these commerce--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="216.171" stopTime="218.928">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="216.171" offset="864653">Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="218.928" stopTime="264.713">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="218.928" offset="875624">--Well, in your hypothetical... and if I could turn to that... I still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.476" offset="1009894">And, in this case, there's no question that the overall production, distribution, and possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances has a profound effect on interstate commerce.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="264.713" stopTime="294.572">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="264.713" offset="1058795">But it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.922" offset="1071647">I mean, in these other... in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v. Filburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.752" offset="1102994">Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.001" offset="1115951">And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.232" offset="1168927">I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="294.572" offset="1178227">Well, no, it doesn't, Justice Scalia, but let me respond in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.248" offset="1188989">First of all, I think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in interstate commerce.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="311.142" stopTime="311.873">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="311.142" offset="1244473">Absolutely.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="311.873" stopTime="324.747">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="311.873" offset="1247399">And I would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="324.747" stopTime="347.906">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="324.747" offset="1298913">But that's quite a different rational than Wickard v. Filburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.317" offset="1309257">I mean, it seems to me you're not... you're not appealing to the fact that it has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.668" offset="1334648">You're appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce cannot effectively be implemented without this law.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="347.906" stopTime="358.929">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="347.906" offset="1391595">Well, I think there's some truth to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.409" offset="1405597">I think what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a different regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.303" offset="1433182">Here, Congress--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="358.929" offset="1435690">But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory... you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject... substances from being sold or... in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.007" offset="1483964">And if you just follow the litter... the letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.619" offset="1506429">In fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.790" offset="1539135">--Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.208" offset="1580826">But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion market... illegal market, albeit... but market in marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.262" offset="1616980">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="694.509" offset="2777966">I think that judgement by Congress has a very definite link to interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to regulate interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.258" offset="2812970">And I do think there's a sense in which when Congress is regulating the price of something, there's certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small producers and for Congress to say,</text>

            <text syncTime="795.197" offset="3180774">Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we would take the position, based on our reading of the Oakland cannabis case... and, obviously, different justices on this Court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical-necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion... I would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of Oakland cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.997" offset="3287980">But I think, in any event, what is important, at this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled Substances Act in an injunctive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.291" offset="3329149">And I think, in that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of activities that's at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.064" offset="3376170">I think, in this regard, it's also worth emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or the fact that their conduct is lawful under California law, is that there's a mismatch between what California law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.925" offset="3455687">Because the California law makes the possession of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.409" offset="4921574">But, here, Congress made it clear that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.047" offset="5164095">But on the current state of the... of the record, there just is not a justification for changing the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.171" offset="5192620">And I think both of the briefs talked a little bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the medical efficacy of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.647" offset="5218534">And I think one thing that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for the individual components in marijuana, that smoked... smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as medicine, because... and that's true, I think, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.180" offset="5288647">One, there's something like 400 different chemical components in crude marijuana that one would smoke, and it's... it just, sort of, belies any logic that all 400 of those would be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.835" offset="5331278">And a big part of the process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude material that somebody could grow in their garden, and actually have people who do this for a living get involved in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial components, and then manufacturing and making that available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.523" offset="5398047">The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.803" offset="5443187">And so the idea that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery device for medicine, I think, is also something that really doesn't have any future as medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.061" offset="5480176">What does have a future for medicine, of course, is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial component.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.670" offset="5502642">That's been done with Marinol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.181" offset="5508702">It is true that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form that Marinol is available in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.444" offset="5533675">And there's ongoing research to try to figure out different ways to deliver that substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.221" offset="5552797">But there is, in a sense, a little bit of a... and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that there's something of a tradeoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.919" offset="5587592">Because one of the downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it takes longer to get into the bloodstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.782" offset="5611102">But that's also one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused, which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of the substance and the time that it has an effect on the system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.581" offset="13422237">Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.789" offset="13447105">As I understand Respondents' position, it's effectively that their clients, and clients like them, in their use of medical marijuana, is somehow so hermetically sealed from the rest of the market on marijuana that it has no effect on that market on marijuana and no effect on the government's overall regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.638" offset="13526518">And I understand that to be true largely because of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.529" offset="13538116">And one of the many problems with that mode of analysis is that the state law is not designed only to carve out those transactions that have no effect on interstate commerce or no effect on the federal regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.529" offset="13586077">Proposition 215 was not tasked as an exercise in cooperative federalism; it was passed as an effort to make medical marijuana lawful to possess, whether you bought it in interstate commerce, whether you bought it with the marijuana having traveled in interstate commerce, whether you bought it, whether you grew it yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.867" offset="13655458">There's a fundamental mismatch with their theory that really, I think, undermines their theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.258" offset="13673012">Now, there's the question now about what kind of impact this would have on the federal enforcement scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.899" offset="13695582">Now, we, in our reply brief, try to use the numbers from one of Respondents' own amici, and we suggest that there's a hundred-thousand people that might be lawful medical users, if their position prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.978" offset="13739886">Now, obviously, this is all an effort in, sort of, counter-factual speculation, so the numbers may be a bit off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.984" offset="13759843">But they suggest that our own government numbers are somehow better, and they cite them on page 18 of the red brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.938" offset="13783667">But the only numbers on the red brief for California suggest that, in the four counties for which there are data, there was....5 percent of the people use marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.368" offset="13821388">Now, if you extend that out statewide to the 34 million people in California, that gives you 170,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.508" offset="13850018">So their numbers... using the government numbers actually give you more potentially affected people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.978" offset="13867886">I think in trying to figure out how many people would be affected, it's worth considering what medical conditions are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.057" offset="13892127">And this responds to Justice Kennedy's last question, Is this just limited to AIDS or people with terminal cancer?</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.938" offset="13915742">And it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.922" offset="13919608">And if you want to look at what is covered as serious medical condition under the statute, you can turn to page 7(a) of the red brief, in the appendix to the red brief, and it suggests that a serious medical condition... there's a catchall at the end that includes subsection 12...</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.398" offset="13977496">"Any other chronic or persistent medical system that, if not alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety or physical or mental health. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.358" offset="14013336">Now, I think that is an exceedingly broad definition of a serious medical condition for which somebody could be... get a recommendation for marijuana for medical uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.919" offset="14051579">Another point worth considering, in considering the impact on the federal regulatory regime or the effectiveness of California in preventing any diversion, is to take a look at two cases we cite in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.588" offset="14094315">One is the People against Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.318" offset="14101211">There's somebody who's arrested with 19 ounces, over a pound, of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.677" offset="14118661">They're packaged such that he has one small bag in his pocket, six other small bags wrapped with a scale in his backpack, two other larger bags in that backpack, and then a pound wrapped in a shirt in the back of his truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.757" offset="14171011">And yet the Appellate Court in California said that he was entitled to go to the jury with the theory that that was for medical use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.529" offset="14198073">The fact that he had a scale, and the fact that it was packaged the way it was, could be explained to the jury because he had just boughten it, and that he used the scale to make sure he wasn't ripped-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.167" offset="14232660">I think that shows that it's going to be very hard to enforce the regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.819" offset="14251259">The other case in the reply brief worth mentioning is the Santa Cruz case, because that's a case where a Federal District Court, after Raich came out, said that it could not enforce the DA and the Controlled Substances Act against a 250-person cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.247" offset="14312908">And that just shows that this is not something that will be limited to one or two users at a time, but will have a substantial impact on the government's ability to enforce the Controlled Substances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.585" offset="14350315">Thank you.</text>
