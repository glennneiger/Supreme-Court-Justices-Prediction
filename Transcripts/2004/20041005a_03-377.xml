            <text syncTime="53.870" offset="215458">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.689" offset="222668">This is a straightforward case of... of statutory construction in which the words, context, purpose, and history of the statute in question all point to a single meaning that is contrary to the conclusion reached by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.911" offset="271569">The case concerns the Truth in Lending Act's basic statutory damages provision, 1640(a)(2)(A)(i), or little (i) I'll call it here, which since the statute's enactment, has allowed individuals to recover from lenders who violate the act an amount equal to twice the finance charge, but limited to a range of $100 to $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.778" offset="363102">This statutory damage recovery is available under the act without regard to actual injury or intent or fault by the lender.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.549" offset="390165">In addition to statutory damages, the act provides for actual damages to be available, administrative agency enforcement, and criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.027" offset="424020">I want to just talk briefly about the history of the act because I think it's... it's critical to understanding the issue before the Court, and I'll refer to places where we've quoted it in the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.733" offset="470831">As enacted in 1968... and this provision appears at the bottom of page 5 of our brief up to the top of page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.528" offset="506044">The provision I've described was the only statutory damage provision, and it was followed by language that indicated... and I should say it appeared... and this is important... at that time, in section 1640(a)(1) and began right there after the (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="146.302" offset="585143">And the limitation of liability that appears there says the words that liability under this paragraph shall not be less than $100, nor more than $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.342" offset="629342">That section was first amended in 1974, and the amended language appears at the top of page 7 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.593" offset="674273">And what happened in 1974 was that this provision... the actual words of the provision were not changed except for one, but it was moved because other things were added to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.360" offset="721398">And it now became... instead of 1640(a)(1), it became section 1640(a)(2)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="187.419" offset="749610">The only change in the provision, the only word changed was the change from the word paragraph... liability under this paragraph... to the... to the word subparagraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.738" offset="790883">The next amendment... and then the... the statute after this then stood for nearly 20 years unchanged at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.338" offset="1425345">They simply said move the or from the middle of that provision to the end and insert the following language, and the following language was the expression of an intent to increase the cap on a class of loans that had actually previously been included in the... in the overarching provision that relates to loans, which is the original one that we're talking about here that deals with twice the finance charge, capped at $1,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.204" offset="4540813">But... but we also in footnote 15 and in the text on that page refer to a whole collection of books, drafting books, mostly dealing with Federal legislative drafting, and all uniformly saying... and again, we're not trying to say that these are binding authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.354" offset="4601313">We're simply trying to say that in the... in the process of Federal legislative drafting, this is what the legislative draftsmen try to do, and then you look at the statute and you look to see what they in fact have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.416" offset="4645616">And you see that this provision is there for a very particular reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="1174.891" offset="4699533">And then when you look at the statute and you see that the statute consistently uses them in that way, uses the word in that way, you've got a good start on understanding what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.707" offset="4734746">The... the last thing I want to say deals with, as I guess in the order I should be talking about it, legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.446" offset="4757734">And there are two points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.138" offset="4764526">One is in 1995 by adding clause (iii), Congress added... created a provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.933" offset="4799634">Again, I want to emphasize what they did is they pulled out of part (i), or clause little (i), which dealt with loans in general and said twice the finance charge... it pulled out the category of loans that were mortgage loans, and it said we want to impose a higher cap on those loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.766" offset="4871001">And there is legislative history that we cite in our brief that indicates that that was what they were thinking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.460" offset="4893780">If they had intended to eliminate, entirely eliminate, not... not increase from $1,000 to $2,000, but entirely eliminate the cap on the entire category of... of loans, two things would be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.796" offset="4947174">Number one, somebody would have said something about it surely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.261" offset="4960967">This is the dog that didn't bark, as this... many members of this Court have... have observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.091" offset="4980297">And there's not a breath of a thought in any legislative history that anybody meant to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.549" offset="4998165">And the second point, which is even perhaps more telling, is that if they had done that, they would have contradicted the clear purpose of what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.094" offset="5032333">They wanted a higher cap on mortgage loans than on loans in general, and it's clearly the case that if they had eliminated the cap on loans in general, they would have a lower cap on mortgage loans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.864" offset="5191367">I think there's really no good reason to distinguish between, you know, no cap on (i) and a cap on (ii).</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.413" offset="5217593">And I'm prepared to argue this, but I think it's way down in the noise level in terms of what... what is relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.260" offset="5237029">The... the last point that I think I would... I would like to make is just that if the Court decides to reverse and if the Court were to decide that... that $1,000 cap is in fact... has always been and continues to be the law, we would simply ask the Court also to remand with regard to the attorney fee award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.777" offset="5319053">The situation in this case would then be that the plaintiff, or the respondent, will have recovered $5,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.064" offset="5384255">And the court below reduced the fees at a time when the recovery for the plaintiff was $29,000, reduced them by 40 percent on the ground that plaintiff's counsel had... had raised 40-some claims, all of which failed, except for 2, and basically indicated that that was a strong reason for reducing the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.355" offset="5473384">I would submit if they essentially recovered $1,000 in this case, that that would be a reason to submit it back to the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.557" offset="12126145">The first is just to repeat that the last time Congress enacted the word subparagraph in this provision was in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.700" offset="12154776">I don't understand why the 1995 amendment is not simply subsequent legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.652" offset="12174524">It tells us nothing about what Congress meant in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.874" offset="12187481">The second point is, Justice Scalia, I'd like to... I wasn't quick enough to think when you said before that if you read the way the Fourth Circuit did, there's no inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.988" offset="12227918">Indeed, not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.481" offset="12229904">There is still an incongruity between clause (i) and clause (iii) because contrary to what Mr. Blankingship has said, ever since the beginning of TILA, mortgage transactions have been covered by the Truth in Lending Act, I can assure you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.310" offset="12285179">And prior to this addition in 1995, they were dealt with in clause (i).</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.073" offset="12868232">I... I think there's a question of how one goes about doing that, and you have to actually show harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.848" offset="12887353">And so, you know, the question is how do you prove that and in what kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.413" offset="12901564">I do want to say and be clear... I think I said earlier that in 36 of 37 uses in TILA, the meaning is clear and refers to... subparagraph is used to refer to a capital letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.559" offset="12946181">The 37th is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.795" offset="12951092">In fact, I would agree with Mr. Blankingship's reading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.190" offset="12960705">But 36 out of 37 ain't bad, particularly when we know in 1974 exactly what they meant to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.319" offset="12985260">The... the last point I guess I just want to sum up by saying is that I think this case really has a lot in common with the parable of the elephant and the blind man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.993" offset="13027892">And when a blind man examines an elephant's leg and decides that it's a tree, maybe it's because he hasn't been able to... to discern what else is out there and consider what other considerations there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.426" offset="13073659">And in this case I think clearly what we have is a case where simply reading a single sentence of a statute and thinking you know what it means and militantly refusing to look anywhere else will very likely lead you to the wrong answer in many cases.</text>
