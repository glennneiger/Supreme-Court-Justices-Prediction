            <text syncTime="43.770" offset="175020">But is it not a part of... that is not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is it, that it does not show?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="50.790" offset="203128">Justice Stevens, there is not a clear answer to that question in all candor.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.395" offset="225489">It is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.480" offset="229878">I will tell you that the lower courts uniformly in the ADEA disparate impact context apply Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Watson and the Wards Cove rule rather than the post-1991 Civil Rights Act rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.526" offset="298005">That is a debatable proposition because, as your question suggests, in subsection (f)(1) of the statute where this provision comes from... and let me just take us to the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.627" offset="342413">It would probably be most useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.551" offset="346175">In the blue book, the... the blue petitioners' brief at page 1 are the relevant provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.680" offset="366655">(a)(2) we'll come back to.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.223" offset="380865">That's the parallel language to Griggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.010" offset="387971">The reasonable factor other than age provision is (f)(1), and it says: it shall not be unlawful for an... this is at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.827" offset="419213">It shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited... and I'm going to come back and focus on that... under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.172" offset="464666">The fact that it says otherwise prohibited seems to suggest that this is setting up an employer defense, as your question indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.419" offset="493610">And the Court in the... the Western Air Lines case in 1986 said that the BFOQ provision, which is in (f)(1) as well, is an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.062" offset="532167">So I--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="133.463" stopTime="233.015">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="133.463" offset="533838">You put your finger on exactly what's the part of this case that's bothering me.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.297" offset="549094">Read through the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.484" offset="557871">As you read through the language, disparate impact does seem to be called for, and this particular provision, reasonable factors other than age, seems a defense to that, just as BFOQ is the defense to disparate treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.420" offset="621610">And that all seems to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.548" offset="630178">But you read the definition of reasonable factor other than age to mean business necessity or even Justice O'Connor's opinion, which is pretty tough.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.236" offset="680856">It's hard for an employer to make that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.002" offset="696007">And while making it hard to make that defense in the case of gender or race discrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly well.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.057" offset="732160">You start making it hard to make that defense here and you're going to have a nightmare because every effort by any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment of his or her employees is going to have a disparate impact in respect to age because the correlation with age runs into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.577" offset="846263">So I can't believe that Congress really would have wanted that, but the reason I can't believe it is because I can't believe the business necessity part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.328" offset="889208">And so here I'm faced with a reg which, at one and the same time, pulls in disparate impact and business necessity, and now I don't know what to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.856" offset="939363">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="237.684" offset="950648">The answer is that you should recognize, as does the commission, which has delegated rulemaking authority under the act, that business necessity, which is the term of art that they used in the regulation... and we'll come back to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.933" offset="999654">It's at page 2 of the blue brief... means different things in different contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.066" offset="1016163">And so I want to take you to the specific citations where the EEOC has recognized the common sense principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.963" offset="1039778">We know that more things that are legitimate employer practices correlate with age than they do with race and gender.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="267.184" offset="1068722">Mr. Goldstein, before you do that, before you deal with the EEOC regulation, this statute doesn't... at least on... on the page 1 part you called our attention to, doesn't refer to business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.060" offset="1136222">That's in the EEOC regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.062" offset="1144163">If I were just reading this statute cold, I'd say, yes, that looks like an affirmative defense to me, but reasonable factor seems like something quite different than necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.294" offset="1197140">It isn't necessary for the business to do this, but it's reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.755" offset="1215007">And if that's... then the business necessity... it seems to me, at least arguably, an improper construction of this act, that the EEOC got it wrong when it referred to business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.633" offset="1282508">They were thinking of Griggs and... and title VII, but this statute says reasonable factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.654" offset="1310616">Our position relies only on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.249" offset="1320960">We embrace the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.664" offset="1330573">(f)(1) says that the employer's conduct merely has to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.297" offset="1345097">We agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.505" offset="1350008">The point I would then take you to is that in... if the Court were interested in the regulation... we don't think it's necessary to get to the regulation, but if it were, the EEOC has said that it too recognizes that the phrase, business necessity, in the context of the Age Act does not mean essential to the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.293" offset="1417091">Let me tell you why it used the language it did, business necessity, in the regulation just to clear it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.977" offset="1439869">And that is when this Court first used the words, business necessity, in Griggs and then subsequently in Wards Cove, it didn't have all the connotations that it does now as being quite a high employer burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.823" offset="1491278">If I could just read to you two things from Griggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.514" offset="1502041">Griggs said, the touchstone is business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.092" offset="1512281">If the employment practice cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.274" offset="1537045">It simply required related to job performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.353" offset="1545404">That's the backdrop on which the EEOC used the word.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="389.273" offset="1557002">Well, I'm not sure you're right about that, Mr. Goldstein, because if you think of what it was, it was a pen and paper test and it was a high school diploma.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.578" offset="1598276">Now, an employer might well think I want to upgrade my work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.766" offset="1618965">I want this to be a real classy work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.298" offset="1629100">So I'm going to require a high school diploma.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.618" offset="1642371">It isn't necessary, but why is it unreasonable for me to do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="415.650" offset="1662537">So I... I don't... I think Griggs spoke about rules that were built in headwinds because a large part of the population didn't have the opportunity to get high school diplomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.445" offset="1721678">That doesn't exist in the age discrimination area.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.098" offset="1736307">So I... I don't think that Griggs is an example of something that was a loose business necessity rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.199" offset="6016731">I did also want to say that it is the liability threshold that is the key for deciding how to accommodate the respondents' concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.819" offset="6291226">If I may, I'd like to go straight to the question as to why mere statistical correlations with age don't create a prima facie case of discrimination because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.984" offset="6331873">This Court in its title VII cases has said that a mere statistical correlation with race or sex can create a prima facie case of discrimination because of race or sex because it's advanced a proposition that there's no inherent correlation between race and sex and ability to perform a job or do a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.355" offset="6413375">And as a consequence, the Court has said that a statistical disparity is a departure from the expected norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.035" offset="6440124">Thus, the statistical disparity creates a suspect situation which could be treated as a prima facie case of discrimination because of age, to use the Court's term in Watson, the functional equivalent of intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.844" offset="6499370">In the age context, the premise doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.394" offset="6517551">In the age context, as Justice Breyer pointed out in the Florida Power argument, as he's pointed out again today, age is inherently correlated with myriad selection practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.496" offset="6565930">It's painful to say, particularly to a Court that's a little bit older than I am, but our mental and physical capacities are not constant over our lifetimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.110" offset="6852336">--The answer to that is as follows, is that Justice... Chief... then Justice Rehnquist, now Chief Justice Rehnquist, wrote a dissent from denial at the time of Geller v. Markham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.123" offset="6900402">And in my practical experience... and I do defend these cases for a living... that put a tremendous chill on the plaintiffs bar, and there were very few of these cases brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.255" offset="6948989">But contrary to Mr. Goldstein, who doesn't represent employers and help them plan their selection practices, employers made huge changes in the '80's and the early '90's until this Court's decision in Hazen Paper because employers were scared of these cases, and so employers started managing the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.827" offset="7019207">There were a lot of reductions in force in the late '80's, as I'm sure this Court remembers, as our Nation when through a... a industrial restructuring.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.998" offset="7091931">And the irony, of course, is... is in doing that, employers adversely impact the very people who are benefitted by the disparate impact doctrine under title VII because the Age Discrimination Act principally favors more senior, older white males, and when you try to manage your numbers so that you don't adversely impact older white males, what happens is... is you adversely impact the new entrants to the work force who in the last 25 years have been much greater numbers of racial minorities and females.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.618" offset="12550374">This Court in Hazen Paper construed the because of language in 4(a)(1) as a reference to intent and said statistical correlations of age are not sufficient to establish because of age within the meaning of section 4(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.319" offset="12605231">And the presumption of uniform usage... we're entitled to point to it as well that the presumption of uniform usage which would be that the phrase, because of age, in section 4(a)(2) is also not satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.090" offset="12672313">And the reason why title VII is different than the Age Act... I keep coming back to this because this is so critical, Justice Breyer... is that the premise of the Court's statistical cases under title VII is that it's... it presumes that there's no inherent difference in ability between the races and the genders, whereas you know and I know that there is a difference in an... an inherent correlation between abilities and skills, between people of different ages statistically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.577" offset="12794253">And so that whereas in the... in the race and sex context, a statistical disparity by itself points out that there's something suspect and so would justify putting the employer to the burden on those occasions which would happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.077" offset="13616274">Our stare decisis case I think is fairly decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.137" offset="13628500">The language of title VII was the model for the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.759" offset="13646994">It runs all the way through the same in subsection (a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.050" offset="13660160">This Court construed the text of the statute to give rise to disparate impact liability, and there are six cases of this Court that say when the language is the same, because one was derived from the other, we give them the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.358" offset="13717420">Now, I take it that the respondents have three answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.633" offset="13730482">The first is they attempt to rewrite the rationale of Griggs and say Griggs really isn't so much about the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.641" offset="13758485">It's what Congress was getting after, and this Court in Griggs was principally concerned with the fact that, look, in the context of age and sex discrimination, there's no legitimate correlation between an... a disparate impact and a legitimate employer policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.365" offset="13817417">That is not, in fact, what the rationale of Griggs is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.481" offset="13829851">The rationale of Griggs is that it doesn't matter to the employee if you are purposefully discriminated against or accidentally discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.188" offset="13860676">Congress was concerned with the effects of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.058" offset="13872170">And this Court reached that conclusion based on the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.339" offset="13885336">If I could read from Griggs, quote, the objective of Congress in the enactment of title VII is plain from the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.068" offset="13912189">That's the same language as in our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.978" offset="13919817">The thrust of section 703(a)(2) was to address, quote, the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.079" offset="13952313">This Court subsequently reiterated twice that disparate impact comes from the text of the statute, not from the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.659" offset="13982616">Those two cases are quoted at page 9 of our reply brief and they resolve all doubts about commas and because of or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.288" offset="14017097">The Court in both Connecticut v. Teal and Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in Watson tied it directly to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.639" offset="14046459">If I could just read the Watson example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.588" offset="14054296">Again, they're quoted in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.953" offset="14059729">In disparate impact cases, quote, the employer's practices may be said to, quote, adversely affect an individual's status as an employee because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.538" offset="14114064">Now, the second argument they have... and this was the Fifth Circuit's argument... is the RFOA provision exists in the ADEA, not in title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.243" offset="14148963">I do not understand how the RFOA provision... if it means anything, it doesn't help us.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.840" offset="14371318">But the premise of (f)(1) is if it's already otherwise unlawful, this is a defense to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.938" offset="14391693">The third thing that they say is that in Hazen Paper this Court construed the because of language in (a)(1) not to refer to impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.698" offset="14430772">The critical difference is that the (a)(1) language does not include the... the clause that refers to the impact on the employee that Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer talked about with Mr. Nager.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.096" offset="14472359">They're structured very differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.326" offset="14477270">As to the practicalities, let me just say this has been the rule for a quarter century of the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.257" offset="14497019">It was the rule in every circuit until 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.619" offset="14510393">It is still the rule in three circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.649" offset="14518544">The notion that there is a big problem with administering it and that the EEOC can't recognize the... as it has in all the examples we cite, that it's easier for an employer to prevail in the ADEA context is not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.929" offset="14575700">I also want to just agree with Justice Breyer, that an important part of impact liability is just making employers think about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.419" offset="14601613">And that comes from Justice Kennedy's opinion in McKennon where he said that disparate impact, quote, acts as a spur or catalyst to cause employers to self-examine and self-evaluate their employment practices to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of discrimination.</text>
