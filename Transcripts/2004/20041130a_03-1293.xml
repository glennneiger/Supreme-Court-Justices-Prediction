            <text syncTime="1008.200" offset="4160763">Well, if Congress inadvertently omitted the overt act requirement, this Court has on prior occasions read into congressional silence terms, definitions that Congress may have inadvertently left out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.020" offset="4211963">So in United States v. Taylor, for example, the question was whether or not Congress intended to revert back to the common law definition of burglary in the Career Criminals Amendment Act, and in 1984, the Career Criminals Amendment Act had language that talked about a generic burglary, breaking and entering into a dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.523" offset="4293987">In 1986, when they amended the act, they removed that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.525" offset="4310079">The question before the Court then came up what does... you know, what does burglary mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.521" offset="4330036">Congress had omitted those words, but the Court found that that wasn't Congress' intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.675" offset="4354591">They clearly didn't intend to revert back to the common law, and it was probably an error of drafting and this Court found that generic burglary was the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.553" offset="4394088">So this Court has done that before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.997" offset="4403910">In the... in the Perrin case, United States v. Perrin, the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.822" offset="4419166">There... words were missing from the statute and the Court did not find that in Perrin... it was a bribery case, and what was at issue was whether or not the... the statute covered bribery of private persons or only the common law definition where it would only incorporate bribery of public... public persons, public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.223" offset="4496802">And the Court said even though there are other statutes that have private person language in it, similar to this case, even though there are other statutes that have overt act requirements in it, we are not going to assume that Congress intended to revert back to the common law and interpret bribery as only applying to public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.532" offset="4566079">So this Court can look at the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.355" offset="4577363">The purpose is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.396" offset="4581543">The Government admits that the purpose of the act was to increase the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.033" offset="4596067">Prior to 1956(h), money laundering conspiracies were prosecuted pursuant to 371, which required the commission of an overt act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.872" offset="4631385">Congress clearly intended to increase the penalty from 5 years to a potential 10 or 20 years, based on what the object of the conspiracy was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.221" offset="4664821">The legislative history all reflects that fact, and the Government admits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.836" offset="4683316">The... as contrasted with 846, which... in which the public law described 846 in a section labeled offenses and provision in the money laundering context, the public law described 1956(h) as a penalty to increase the... as a money laundering conspiracy for increasing the penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.182" offset="6488691">The money laundering conspiracy statute does not require proof of an overt act for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.521" offset="6510007">First, the text of the statute contains no such requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.232" offset="6524844">Second, the statute is modeled on the drug conspiracy statute which this Court unanimously held in the Shabani case does not require proof of an overt act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.383" offset="6561416">Third, the statute was enacted against the background rule of statutory construction that... that a conspiracy provision, whose text conditions liability on the act of conspiring only, will be construed to follow the common law, where proof of an overt act was not required for conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.068" offset="6628185">This Court should adhere to its bright line rule in this case because it provides clear guidance to Congress and to the lower courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.120" offset="6704358">First, the money laundering conspiracy statute, section 1956(h), is not a penalty provision for the general conspiracy statute, section 371.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.209" offset="6744795">Section 1956(h) does not contain any reference to section 371, and petitioners are unable to cite any provision in the United States Code that provides a penalty for an offense defined elsewhere, without also referencing where that offense is defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.994" offset="6811878">Under petitioners' theory, if section 371 were appealed tomorrow, section 1956(h) would also no longer be valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.005" offset="7415933">Petitioners also argue that because prior to enactment of section 1956(h), the Government had to prosecute money laundering conspiracies for 6 years under section 371, that this Court should presume that Congress intended to perpetuate the overt act requirement of section 371 into the money laundering conspiracy offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.955" offset="7491793">But this Court looks, first, to the text of the statute to discern Congress' intent, and had Congress wanted to perpetuate section 371's overt act requirement, it could have easily modeled the text of section 1956(h) on the language from 371 or on the language from any of the other numerous conspiracy provisions in the code that contained express overt act requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.085" offset="7568279">Congress chose a different model, the drug conspiracy statute, which as I said before, this Court held in Shabani does not contain an overt act requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.325" offset="7605269">By choosing that model, Congress manifested its intent not to require proof of an overt act because at the time it... because at the time it acted, the background rule of statutory construction provided that a conspiracy statute that conditions liability solely on the act of conspiring would be construed to follow the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.789" offset="7675068">Petitioners point to silence in the legislative history, but the silence in the legislative history on the overt act requirement is not the kind of compelling evidence of... of contrary intent that would justify departing from the text of the statute and this Court's bright line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.154" offset="7732537">Finally, petitioners rely on a venue provision for money laundering cases, section 1956(i), which was enacted 9 years after the money laundering conspiracy statute at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.363" offset="7785409">That venue provision reflects Congress' intent to identify a variety of districts in which money laundering cases can be brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.118" offset="8048410">Petitioners seize on the fact that the venue provision permits venue to be laid in any district in which an overt act was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.507" offset="8085922">But the rule in conspiracy cases has always been that an overt... that venue can be laid where an overt act was committed regardless of whether an overt act was an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.942" offset="8123747">At common law, as I said before, conspiracies... a conspiracy conviction did not rely... depend on proof of an overt act, and yet venue could always be laid at common law where an overt act was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.016" offset="8172021">The common law venue rule has been applied consistently to modern Federal conspiracy statutes, such as the drug conspiracy statute, which likewise does not require proof of an overt act as an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.498" offset="8217892">Congress' codification in the money laundering statute of... of this... of this venue principle cannot be read to presuppose an overt act element when the very venue rule it was codifying did not presuppose one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.891" offset="8751522">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.946" offset="8759672">Justice Ginsburg, you had inquired about the number of subsection... conspiracy subsections, and I didn't get a chance to answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.506" offset="8793945">Even if you don't find the statute is unique because of the venue provision, as my review of the conspiracy subsections in title 18, there were only about two others out of the 50-some-odd cases that have the same structural anomaly that 1956(h) does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.729" offset="8862803">So this would not be opening up a can of worms to say that in this case an overt act clearly was intended by Congress and that we need to look at congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.677" offset="8902614">So it wouldn't be... require... a holding in this case consistent with congressional purpose would not require the Court to then have to review every single title 18 conspiracy subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.266" offset="8945037">As the Government pointed out, money laundering cases are not typically prosecuted without the commission of an overt act because overt acts are relatively simple to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.878" offset="8983489">There's no reason why Congress would have intentionally eliminated the overt act requirement from money laundering conspiracies when, on the one hand, it's easy to prove, but on the other hand, it placed such a critical value in money laundering conspiracies because it's not just that it shows that criminal intent has crystallized and that money laundering is actually afoot, but you're talking about taking offenses, like we say in our brief, where someone pledges a... a cow for collateral for a loan and then they talk with a friend about whether or not they should sell the cow, and they decide not to sell the cow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.747" offset="9118908">Under the Government's theory, they couldn't be prosecuted for defrauding the Government because, in fact, they never sold the cow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.184" offset="9144612">They couldn't be prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud the Government because they didn't commit an overt act in furtherance of defrauding the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.097" offset="9176273">They couldn't be convicted or prosecuted for money laundering because they never sold the cow, so there were never any proceeds to generate.</text>
