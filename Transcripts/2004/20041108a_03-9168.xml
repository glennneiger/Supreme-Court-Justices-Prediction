            <text syncTime="373.075" offset="1492219">At the end of the opinion, Justice Blackmun says, you know, there are some States like Massachusetts, for example, that instead of just saying burglary, they say burglary of a... of a ship or a car or a building.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.087" offset="1548330">And that leads us to answer a more general question.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.156" offset="1560555">Well, in context, that more general question is whether you ought to go look into how a particular burglary was committed to see if there was really violence or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.695" offset="1594723">And he says no.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.597" offset="1602351">Just look to the definition of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.236" offset="1612904">That's what he says.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.148" offset="1620532">Now, he says we agree, because I started here, that we have a couple of States with some weird statutes, and what you have to do in those States is you won't know if it's a boat or a car or... so he says, for example, in a State like the one we have, if it shows it's charged us with a burglary and you have to find out, you know, here's what you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.137" offset="1708513">It says you may have to go beyond the mere fact of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.436" offset="1721678">So he says go look to the indictment or information and jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.303" offset="1749159">That isn't a limiting phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.817" offset="1755220">That's for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.660" offset="1762638">He just thought that in those cases, that's what... all you'll have to look to, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.557" offset="1786149">We happen to have an unusual case where there are no jury instructions because he pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.426" offset="1805688">So what's the harm of going looking to the documents that will show, in an uncontested way, just what the address on these pieces of paper show?</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.269" offset="12536999">First, I would like to point out that the Armed Career Criminal Act does not punish all recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.872" offset="12571481">It is designed to punish the people who have prior convictions for those offenses falling... falling within the categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.075" offset="12608261">So it's not designed to punish all recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.656" offset="12618606">Massachusetts does have generic burglary statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.975" offset="12635847">These statutes that are at issue here are not among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.296" offset="12653087">But for the serious forms of burglary, such as home invasion, Massachusetts punishes those under generic burglary statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.656" offset="12686524">So those do exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.116" offset="12692376">With regard to the record that the Court can look at in making this determination, it was significant in the district court that Judge Gertner was not pointed to the face of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.831" offset="12751308">And as you look at the complaints that are shown in the third appendix in this case, there is... there are dates listed at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.121" offset="12792477">The entries in those docket sheets were made at different times, not all made at the time of a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.245" offset="12820898">The Government did not present any evidence to help the court understand anything about the way the dockets were made and the entries were made when a guilty plea was taken in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.939" offset="12879726">The third thing of interest is, as Judge Gertner found, there was no reason for a contemporaneous contest of the evidence... of the material in the police report because the police report was not part of the plea proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.955" offset="12947749">So what happens is the district court that's faced with the sentencing issue now has to make the determination, can I now look and see whether there was some contest years ago when the guilty plea was entered without the aid of a contemporaneous record of adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.306" offset="13025176">And what Mr. Shepard's position is, as to what the... the rule should be, is that where... and we don't contest even remotely that guilty pleas don't fall under the ambit of the Armed Career Criminal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.938" offset="13091736">Taylor was a guilty plea itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.868" offset="13099468">That case was a guilty plea... is that where you have a nongeneric statute and you have a conviction by a guilty plea, that the court can look at a charging document and a contemporaneous formal record of adjudication, not simply anything that's found in the court file, and that must establish, based on that examination, that the defendant was necessarily found guilty of all the elements of generic burglary either by his own admission or by a finding by the judge.</text>
