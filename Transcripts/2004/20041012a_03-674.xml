            <text syncTime="57.425" offset="229669">The Eighth Circuit's decision that petitioner, a citizen and a national of Somalia, can be deported to Somalia should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.540" offset="270106">The applicable removal statute requires acceptance from the country of which the alien is a subject, national, or citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.206" offset="304797">That statute is 8 U.S.C. 1231 (b)(2)(D) as in David, which we have referred to as step two.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.751" offset="338965">The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that acceptance is required for such a removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.945" offset="363729">The parties agree that Somalia has no functioning government that can give acceptance in this case, as that term is used in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.833" offset="447321">The circuit court ruled, however, that petitioner could be deported to Somalia because the statute provides that if the alien is not removed to his country of citizenship, then he can be removed to a list of additional countries in the next step of the statute, 1231(b)(2)(E), including the country of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.179" offset="548676">The circuit court erred in that ruling for the following reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.013" offset="583993">The Government takes the position that this statute, whatever it means, was intended to... with the... with the nation abroad in view, that the idea was not to insult our... our neighbors in the world community, so to recognize that they have the prerogative to say yes or no to somebody being sent there, being removed there, but that the statute was not intended to confer any benefit on the removable alien.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.852" offset="831321">The... the statute is... does get at order in the deportation process, and if an alien is being removed to... in a situation where there is no government to receive the alien, where the alien is simply being expelled from the United States, the risk arises that the alien will bounce back to the United States, will simply be in international traffic with no country to receive the alien, and there's nothing in the statute which would indicate that the interest of Congress in ordering the removal process is limited simply... limited simply to a concern about the sovereignty of nations of the other country.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.771" offset="3083076">And their argument is if... if you don't get the condition satisfied, i.e., acceptance, there's no longer a mandate, i.e., shall.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.549" offset="3178162">But... but... so that would be my... my suggested reading of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.924" offset="3195611">But the second reason, going to the structure of the statute, which I think reinforces that and... and is important, is that if it had been... if it had been Congress' intent that if the Government couldn't remove to the country of citizenship because it couldn't get acceptance, that it could then move to step (E) and remove anyway to overcome that acceptance, Congress would not have gone about writing the statute the way that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.788" offset="3307102">The way that it wrote the statute is that it provided in (E) for other countries that the... that the Attorney... Attorney General could remove to, and every one of those countries can be a different country than the country of citizenship by their definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.909" offset="3379618">It would... it would have been a very strange way for the... the Congress to have given the Attorney General the discretion to remove anyway, to make it contingent upon one of those countries in clauses (i) through (vi) to happen to be the same country as the country of subject, nationality, or citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.710" offset="3518798">I mean, if... if acceptance is a condition for all of those preceding things, my goodness, that's certainly not the way to make it clear, to tag it onto (vi) instead of putting it in the introduction or in a clause that comes after (i) through (vii) and goes out to the margin after that.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.035" offset="3700088">And that is what removal is.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.143" offset="3708552">So if we start with that premise, then it makes absolute sense here that there wouldn't be at each place where the... the statute identifies a... a country, where the statute would have to say... make a specific reference to the acceptance requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.580" offset="3770305">My point about reading the statute that way, in terms of its general condition, is that it explains how throughout the statute you would have the... the reference to acceptance in the context in which it appears, but you wouldn't have to repeat it every place where you... where you referenced a country of removal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.321" offset="9617241">Subsection (D) says: if an alien is not removed to a country designated under subparagraph (A)(i), the Attorney General shall remove the alien to a country of which the alien is a subject, national, or citizen unless the government of the country fails to give its consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.637" offset="9678472">And our interpretation of the purpose of subsection (D) is it expresses a strong preference for removal to the country of nationality, assuming that no designation has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.904" offset="9723611">But Congress recognized that to make that an absolute requirement, even in circumstances where there was no acceptance, would embroil the executive branch into foreign policy confrontations because essentially even when the executive branch officials believed it would be an unwarranted affront to foreign states to try to remove in the face of foreign resistance, the statute, without the exception, would be telling the Attorney General you have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.539" offset="9826116">And so Congress, understandably, enacted an... an exception to that requirement, and it says if there is no acceptance, the Attorney General doesn't have to remove.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.003" offset="12639922">One reason for... possible reason for parsing it the way Congress did in (E) is that sometimes the reason that a foreign government doesn't give acceptance may be that the foreign government disputes our contention that this individual is a national of its country, and in order to avoid a recapitulation of that dispute at the subsection (E) stage, Congress might, at least, have though (E) is going to turn on objective factors, factors that are unlikely to be the subject of dispute, and not on the potentially contested question of what country is the... the alien's current country of nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.026" offset="12780042">The... the other thing I'd like to say about the... the two policy justifications that petitioner has given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.615" offset="12802403">The one is that this... his reading of the statute is necessary in order to prevent the... this Government from being entangled in foreign confrontations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.153" offset="12840542">And... and our view is that the executive branch is well equipped to prevent that from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.088" offset="12860291">That is, so long as the statute doesn't require us to attempt repatriation over the objection of another foreign government, the executive branch is... can and will exercise discretion to attempt that course of action only when we believe that it's consonant with the foreign policy goals of the... the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.344" offset="12929358">The other policy objection to our reading that petitioner advances is that places without functioning central governments are likely to be dangerous and that Congress would have wanted to prohibit removal to an... a country where the alien would face hardships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.039" offset="12988082">And we don't attempt to minimize the potential for hardship if an alien is removed to Somalia, but there is a network of Federal statutory provisions that specifically address the question of resistance to removal based on the potential for harm in the receiving country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.636" offset="13054537">And if petitioner can't qualify under any of those, then it's unlikely that Congress would have intended the absence of a functioning central government to serve as a sort of prophylactic or surrogate for dangerous... dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.274" offset="13101035">And it's worth noting in that respect that the Secretary of Homeland Security currently administers the temporary protected status program which covers Somalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.085" offset="13136248">It contains broad protections for removal of aliens there, but petitioner is ineligible for relief under that provision because of his criminal conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.079" offset="13292251">It's set forth on... on 6a of the brief for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.137" offset="13320464">And the critical part says, thereupon deportation of such alien shall be directed to any country of which such alien is a subject, national, or citizen if such country is willing to accept him into its territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.171" offset="13376679">That same language did not just appear in the statute just prior to 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.084" offset="13396323">That was the language that was in the statute in 1952 when it was first passed, and that can be found on page 1a to 1b of... of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.625" offset="13450449">I would also like to point out that we can... in terms of... of interpreting this statute, it's also helpful to look at other statutes that were passed in 1996, specifically in the alien terrorist statute where the Government is... gets to remove someone who's been classified as an alien... alien terrorist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.142" offset="13532473">That statute, which is 8 U.S.C. 1537(b), starting on page 8a of our brief, says specifically that an alien terrorist shall be removed to a country whose government is willing to accept that alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.920" offset="13591615">I would submit that this, if in fact, Congress is going to have... if we're going to have this removal requirement applies clearly to alien terrorists, then certainly this demonstrates that this has... this requirement has always been part of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.374" offset="13665489">And in 1996 Congress had before it those consistent interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.666" offset="13682625">Congress also had before it in 1996 the fact that tens of thousands of aliens could not be deported over the years to countries that would not accept them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.697" offset="13722749">And in 1996, it restated the statute, having those facts and also the consistent judicial history which interpreted the statute to always require acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.131" offset="13768516">As a result of that, we could apply the principle that there was no watchdog barking in the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.037" offset="13792131">Thank you.</text>
