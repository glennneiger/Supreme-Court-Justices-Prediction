            <text syncTime="1086.328" offset="4345208">It then says we must look to our practice to determine whether a manslaughter instruction should be given.</text>

Goodin's counsel did cite Beck itself to the Mississippi court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.828" offset="4451265">Nevertheless, the claim was phrased in precisely the same manner in which Mr. Howell's counsel expressed the same claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.684" offset="4602671">In this case, Howell's trial and appellate counsel raised two issues with regard to the jury instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.031" offset="4668082">Those issues related to whether or not there was sufficient evidence to convict of robbery and whether or not... or attempted robbery rather, and whether or not there was a basis to give a lesser-included instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.614" offset="4738403">The cases which he cites are State cases related to the necessity of giving lesser-included instructions where there's an attempted robbery and simple murder is, therefore, included in that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.270" offset="4797022">He also, at the outset of his contentions with regard to jury instructions, says that under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, these jury instructions... and we contend that they must be considered as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.932" offset="4851670">These jury instructions violate his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.505" offset="4873927">It is our position that this is sufficient... while not a cognate of that, is sufficient to at least be a corresponding claim, a substantially identical claim to Beck, and one which entitles the defendant as a matter of due process and as a matter of Eighth Amendment consideration and concern, to an instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.307" offset="4977162">The difficulty that we face in a circumstance such as this where the instruction is not given is that the jury's function, while not always reviewable, but which is always entitled to protection, may be called into question and the quality of the verdict impeached, in effect, by the failure to have the third option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.716" offset="5086772">In essence, it is our contention that where a defendant uses the very words that this Court has used to describe the constitutional claim, where it uses the very words that the State supreme court has used--</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.014" offset="5987997">For example, the Mease case, which the State cites and to which I made reference, was a case in which capital murder was not robbery murder as in this case, but the killing of a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.185" offset="6040660">In Mease, there was an altercation between the sheriff and Mease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.302" offset="6061140">During that altercation, Mease was struck on the head by another deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.587" offset="6082247">His contention was that the gun fired, which he was holding next to the sheriff's neck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.986" offset="6107847">The gun fired by reaction for two reasons, one that he was in a fight and, secondly, that he was struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.819" offset="6143269">The Mease court said that that was a proper basis to instruct on manslaughter, the fact that he had pulled the gun and was using it during the course of the fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.360" offset="6197394">Now, while I find that case difficult to parse, we believe that that certainly could have been an argument that could have been raised and that, albeit it was not, it could have been a proper instruction to have been given.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.655" offset="6302616">Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.627" offset="6314423">I'd like to make the point, as far as jurisdiction goes, that... that the defendant has failed to make a Federal claim and he is required under Webb v. Webb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.620" offset="6354442">If the Mississippi Supreme Court... if the lower court does not address the issue, then it is assumed that it was not properly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.390" offset="6381505">Now, as to the issue of Beck, there is no Beck violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.189" offset="6396656">Actually Mississippi finally... we've gotten in one instance, we've... we've become first in... in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.164" offset="6424555">In Jackson v. State in 1976, our Supreme Court... which was cited in a footnote 10, I believe, in... in Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.133" offset="6456529">In the Jackson case, Mississippi said... we had the same statute, pretty much, that Alabama had that restricted a lesser-included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.543" offset="6494145">Mississippi said, number one, you cannot restrict that lesser-included offense instruction if it is supported by the facts, and number two, in the Jackson case, the court held that there had to be bifurcation, which was the problem, the impact on the guilt phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.527" offset="6562064">And... and so I would submit to the Court that there is no impact in Mississippi in this case on the guilt phase, nothing to influence the jurors' decision, and that was the inherent problem that the Court recognized in Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.455" offset="6621727">Number two, Mississippi allows a life sentence, which also distinguishes Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.438" offset="6645656">It... it allows the jury, in a separate, bifurcated hearing, to determine whether or not the defendant should receive life or the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.406" offset="6677525">And then thirdly, in Mississippi, we have a broader standard than the Federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.812" offset="6699154">If it's any lesser offense in Mississippi, then the defendant is entitled to it if it's supported by the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.266" offset="6736980">So we have a broader standard that gives the defendant an easier opportunity to meet that standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.649" offset="10598504">But there again, if we go back to what the Federal standards are, we're talking about what the United States Constitution requires, and therefore, I would submit to the Court that we should apply what the Federal law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.545" offset="10642077">And that law is... number one, is it a lesser-included offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.145" offset="10652526">Using the elements test, murder is not a lesser-included offense to capital murder, and the reason being is because capital murder is with or without intent and you add an additional element of murder which requires intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.829" offset="10699233">Same goes for manslaughter because you had the additional sudden provocation element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.371" offset="10717414">So I would say that if we follow the Federal standard and... and that's... that's the floor, and the floor is it's got to be a lesser-included offense, it... it's not a... a lesser-included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.402" offset="10757538">So therefore that should answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.638" offset="10762449">Secondly, under the Federal standard, you have to prove that... that the court... the judge has to decide that the... a reasonable juror would acquit of the greater offense and also convict of the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.953" offset="10823784">Well, Mississippi law does not require that, but I... I'd submit to the Court that... that after the Beck decision in 1980, our supreme court in the case of In re Jordan... they applied the Federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.182" offset="10868715">They required that... when they analyzed Beck, they applied the Federal standard, in other words, the... the part about that you have to acquit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.932" offset="10903719">You have to acquit on... on the greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.699" offset="10914795">And they also included the lesser-included offense language in that Beck analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.189" offset="10936738">So, therefore, had he properly raised the jurisdictional issue... there's nowhere in the record does he cite Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.421" offset="10961607">There's nowhere in the record that he states facts that would even support Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.015" offset="10976026">So had he even properly reached that issue and... and cited Beck, I would submit to the Court that the facts don't support it under Mississippi law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.465" offset="13161848">With regard to the argument that the State makes here that these individuals had ridden around all night with a plan to rob and that, therefore, there were no other... there was no other possibility for the court to consider in... in granting instructions, first, it is our contention that both Mississippi law and due process law requires a judge to instruct a jury on all of the relevant issues in the case, on all the relevant law in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.574" offset="13282220">And in Fairchild v. State, that is precisely what the Mississippi court did in saying that a court could not simply conclude, no matter how strong the evidence of attempt to rob or plan to rob, that it could, in effect, direct a verdict and not instruct on lesser-included offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.137" offset="13408444">We believe that rather than intent the... on the simple murder, that the issue is malice as opposed to intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.394" offset="13441567">The statutory definition, for example, of manslaughter in... in Mississippi statute 97-3... I believe 27 is a killing of a human being without malice and while not in the commission of these felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.206" offset="13520771">Now, it may be that simply a small-town lawyer from... from North Carolina is told don't go to the big city and get stung by some guy coming up to you and saying, you know, I just got off the bus and I need to get some money from you and my kids and my wife are waiting for me in the hotel room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.563" offset="13590152">But that happens not only in the big city, it also happens in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.293" offset="13609169">And so there was a basis in which a jury could reasonably infer that there was a reason to approach that vehicle other than an attempted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.868" offset="13647412">And the question is, what is a reasonable inference?</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.363" offset="13657443">The Mississippi court here in its opinion said that there was clearly evidence from which a jury could infer robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.065" offset="13688163">We concede that, but there were also other inferences that this evidence raised, and that evidence, we respectfully submit, mandated a lesser-included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.409" offset="13737587">We also contend that... that the State has not, heretofore, raised any issue about Beck's continuing vitality, but we respectfully submit that Beck is of continuing vitality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.384" offset="13801535">Just a... a survey of even habeas corpus cases from the various circuits will show that the circuits are continuing to apply Beck even in States where the statutory sentencing scheme is far different from Beck and there is no preclusive statute involved, as there was in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.474" offset="13869871">We respectfully submit that the language in Beck itself speaks to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.252" offset="13892963">The Beck court added, the same reasoning must apply to rules that diminish the reliability of the... the guilt determination, the very point that Justice Kennedy pointed out undercuts Mississippi's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.255" offset="13944999">It is this diminution of the reliability of the guilt determination that is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.481" offset="13973838">In addition to that, we would respectfully submit that under these circumstances, there was a basis under which a lesser-included offense instruction was mandated because Beck did not apply the Blockburger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.087" offset="14052310">In fact, it did not incorporate Blockburger, did not refer to Mullaney v. Wilbur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.379" offset="14069447">What it did was it said if there is a lesser-included offense, as defined by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.285" offset="14093061">All of the succeeding cases from this Court have said if there is a lesser-included offense, as defined by State law, conceding that State law is the applicable standard then and not the standard that the State now seeks to impose, which it never raised in... in its brief, which it has never asserted to be the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.052" offset="14176131">Blockburger is certainly not cited in anything that the State has submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.971" offset="14191804">Blockburger is not contended to be the basis, nor could it be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.482" offset="14205910">The basis is is there a lesser-included offense under State law, and we contend that that is the basis on which this case should be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.148" offset="14240496">Thank you very much.</text>
