            <text syncTime="25.207" offset="100728">Pesticides are economic poisons designed to kill living things.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.005" offset="123925">Sometimes they do not work as designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.355" offset="141375">For more than a century until the 1990's, courts routinely permitted farmers to bring claims against pesticide manufacturers for crop damage caused by pesticides.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.404" offset="189544">In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972, Congress did not intend to displace those preexisting State law remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.926" offset="227683">The farmers here allege claims for defective design, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach of warranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product that severely damaged their peanut crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.556" offset="286198">I'd like to start with our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstrate for three reasons why those claims survive preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.075" offset="324232">The defective design and manufacturing claims challenge the product's composition, not its label.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.694" offset="358713">The fraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general legal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the failure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or in addition to FIFRA requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.945" offset="431752">Now, with respect to the first point, Dow concedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective design and manufacturing claims generally are not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.019" offset="476056">That concession warrants a remand here, as this case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers to develop their claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.096" offset="540317">That is, they didn't warn about the effects, but those effects would not have been present if the product had been designed to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse effect on the peanut crop.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.335" offset="621296">Justice Ginsburg, the way the Restatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 1 and 2 describe, there are basically three theories that products liability claims can proceed on: a defective design, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.105" offset="688379">The restatement explains that they are distinct legal theories that go to different problems that the manufacturer has caused with respect to the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.176" offset="728607">A defective design claim asserts that the composition was inadequate and that a properly designed product could have been put on the market that would not cause the harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.066" offset="968202">The district court, after finding jurisdiction, considered Dow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and locked us out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chance to prove that a safer design for the product could have been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.471" offset="3049848">--A warranty claim, Justice O'Connor, as this Court made clear in the Cipollone case, is not a requirement under State law because it's a voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.697" offset="3098749">The Court I think has made clear that what has to be ascertained here is does the State cause of action or the State law create a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.756" offset="3142949">That's not true in the warranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements in... as to warranties.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.727" offset="3170847">It speaks to requirements in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.157" offset="3180565">So what Dow did here with its warranty was completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that warranty by putting on the market a product that was not suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.006" offset="3243990">Breach of that is not a requirement imposed under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.417" offset="3261649">And that has been, I think, verified by seven Justices of this Court in the... in the Cipollone case.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.217" offset="3292787">Now, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is important to understand that in both Cipollone and in a footnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where there are general legal duties that are not observed by the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product itself, those claims are not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.557" offset="3378155">Here our assertion is that Dow put on the market a... a product that was mislabeled and that they went out and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.357" offset="3437401">We acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.976" offset="3447850">Those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.986" offset="3463941">And the existence of the preemption clause of 136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try to prove to a court that fraud was committed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.467" offset="3509812">Now, if I could briefly address two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.713" offset="3526844">One is that the inducement to change theory should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.611" offset="3546384">That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.747" offset="3574909">First, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b) which says requirements for labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.167" offset="3604584">It doesn't say requirements that induce a change to the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.206" offset="3624751">And that's how many of the courts have gone off track since the Cipollone decision was announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.717" offset="3650769">They have read FIFRA as saying just because the word requirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to change the label is thereby preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.006" offset="3712000">We think that's overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced to change the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.341" offset="3785352">Because EPA does not evaluate the specific contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are made on... on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to court and say we would have to change the label and thereby 136v(b) preempts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.513" offset="3878034">Now, I'd also like to stress that the other side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.418" offset="3913665">As your question, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not evaluate efficacy on the front end.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.191" offset="3940728">And in fact, the history behind these provisions is that EPA understood from the very beginning that common law claims would serve an important incidental regulatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.019" offset="3992033">If we could review the history for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.566" offset="4002168">Prior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers had brought claims against manufacturers for design defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law claims that we have asserted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.308" offset="4061205">It was so well established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the American Law Reports that annotated all the cases and explained what the common law duties of pesticide manufacturers were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.733" offset="4110838">Yet, notwithstanding that, when Congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there is not one mention of any effort to displace those preexisting common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.791" offset="4183144">And when EPA, in discharging its responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by the requirement that it re-register products that were already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's standards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.835" offset="4279275">Congress responded, but importantly in the administrations on both sides, EPA has always understood except until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor General changed the position of the Government, that these kinds of incidental common law suits would have an important regulatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.466" offset="4361822">If we could just take the case of DDT.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.685" offset="4370704">For 30 years, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages until it became clear that the groundswell over the course of decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only at the back end that the expert agency regulators determined that in fact the product needed to be banned, but that was only after a very long history in which common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and others who were harmed by that product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.760" offset="4487001">Now, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater products than had been done in the Carter administration in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.829" offset="4539246">And in the Federal Register notice announcing that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the EPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who put on the market ineffective products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.296" offset="4609149">We cited that on page 31 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.657" offset="4762540">The Government in the Medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said there was no problem to be had with juries rendering supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were following one Federal standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.312" offset="5037244">The answer is that... that Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of disuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very clear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b... surround... by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow States to depart in significant respects from what was nationally uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.538" offset="5126060">And the way it did so was to say States can regulate sale or use and they can also impose extra requirements for special locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.563" offset="5162214">Now, what Dow did here I think illustrates the way the system is supposed to work, which is that when a problem was identified with their product in the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it petitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label a supplemental label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.306" offset="5245179">And that supplemental label says it is for distribution in those three States only and it provided 10 important changes to the label that it otherwise had as a nationally uniform label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.133" offset="5296483">That's how the system is supposed to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.297" offset="5305156">If the incidental regulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims induces or causes some kind of change to the label, that can be done without an adverse effect to national uniformity through the supplemental labeling process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.383" offset="5369522">And what Dow did here was it has its label and then it attaches the supplemental label that addresses the particular conditions that exist in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.235" offset="5400869">And the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly appropriate and valid way to address the geographic, environmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the different regions of the country that engage in agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.504" offset="5453949">There's nothing that is uncertain about that if you accept the premise of the Government's argument in Medtronic, which is that juries can be properly instructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow the appropriate Federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.302" offset="5521136">Now, I would like to turn... sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.898" offset="5543497">Did you... no, go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.066" offset="5548199">I would like to turn briefly to the... the requirements aspect of the case because we do think that, under our broadest theory, this is a different situation than Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important statutory indications that are in the provision 136v.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.407" offset="5653525">Unlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that is a non-preempted provision, and that is different from Medtronic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.247" offset="5684976">Where in Medtronic there was a provision that allowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to requirements and whether or not the States should be displaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a) and in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.737" offset="5762926">They're in addition to what the Federal standard is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.686" offset="5774733">That means that you have to look at requirements in a somewhat different way because the States have this authority that they did not have under the Medical Device Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.833" offset="5823321">There's a textual indicator under (b) also which refers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that shall issue these requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.646" offset="5866580">Such... the meaning of it in Webster's means what has been already described... is in (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.737" offset="5906913">So we think that there is a textual basis for distinguishing the word requirements that this Court... five Justices in this Court in Medtronic said would encompass common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.511" offset="5949962">If there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to reserve the balance--</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.935" offset="6331664">Because Congress has also passed an amendment to the effect that unless EPA chooses to get in to the business of... of passing on efficacy, it... it need not do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.140" offset="6388506">Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to those subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't the subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of... of the... the whole preemption claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.211" offset="6444826">There are... there are two fundamental reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.516" offset="6454021">The first is that it is a principal requirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains, that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide with the precise labeling to the word and font size that EPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the wording relates to human safety, environmental protection, or efficacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.222" offset="6572826">Now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr. Frederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA to Congress... and Congress'... the... the committee report plainly indicates this... that the EPA was not saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no longer concerned with efficacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.745" offset="6666971">What they said was because the Department of Agriculture and the extension services and the State universities are all involved in this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for registration, even submit a registration application, the manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing, which Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive--</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="3368.716" offset="13474795">I just have two points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.325" offset="13481273">With respect to the summary judgment posture of the case, the way this unfolded was that on one day the district court decided the motion for jurisdiction, that it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.894" offset="13527562">On the very next day, Dow rushed into court with its motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.625" offset="13542400">And what Mr. Waxman cites as the Celotex invocation merely says that on... on this point it is neither unfair nor premature to require defendants to produce evidence in support of their claims now as the Celotex trilogy requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.645" offset="13598511">I'm reading from their motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.733" offset="13606870">That was filed before the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.525" offset="13622021">The only thing that they knew about was the deceptive trade practices notice letter that the farmers had filed pursuant to State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.124" offset="13660473">So they didn't know what our claims were, and they were requiring or saying that the district court could throw us out of court without giving us any opportunity to file counterclaims, much less try to develop evidence that would prove them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.173" offset="13708643">Now, with respect to the disuniformity point, when Congress amended the statute in 1988 to add the word uniformity, it said in that public law that it was a technical amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.814" offset="13767158">We don't know why Congress put the word uniformity in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.558" offset="13778129">The legislative history is barren.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.540" offset="13786070">It just says this is a technical amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.530" offset="13794116">It didn't change the substantive provisions that empowered States to impose regulations that would have the effect of disuniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.081" offset="13836225">Now, at the end of the day, we've got claims that have been brought historically since the late 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.700" offset="13866736">Until EPA had a sudden change of heart, there were decades in which juries made these decisions with respect to these kinds of products, and those preemption decisions really didn't take hold until after this Court announced Cipollone in 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.399" offset="13933505">And it was only at that point that the courts began to have preemption, but for the previous 2 decades, juries routinely decided these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.584" offset="13974256">The sky did not fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.149" offset="13980526">EPA didn't come in and say there's labeling disuniformity as a result of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.458" offset="13997767">There simply were no problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.187" offset="14004663">But what did happen was that the farmers who used products were able to get compensation when pesticides damaged their crops.</text>
