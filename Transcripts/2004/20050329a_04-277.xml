            <text syncTime="64.810" offset="259239">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.063" offset="272196">In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress declared that it is the policy of the United States to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet unfettered by federal or state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.121" offset="344398">The FCC implemented that clear policy directive in the order under review by concluding that cable modem service should be classified as an information service and not a telecommunications service under the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.138" offset="408451">That reasonable determination should be upheld, because it is consistent with the text, history, and purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.953" offset="443768">The Act defines "telecommunications" as the transmission of information without change in form or substance, and "telecommunications service" as the offering of telecommunications directly to the public for a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.901" offset="507507">Given that focus on the nature of the FCC reasonably concluded that the integrated cable modem service offering should be viewed as a whole in determining its classification under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.234" offset="576888">I mean, why is it offered to the public if it's offered alone, but it's not offered to the public if it's offered with a tie-in?</text>
            <text syncTime="153.609" offset="614400">I mean, if... you know, if I say, you know, I'm selling you a windshield alone, I guess I'm offering a windshield.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.922" offset="643657">But if I say, you know, you've got to buy the windshield with a car, am I any less selling you a windshield?</text>

            <text syncTime="168.314" offset="673228">Well, I don't think we would say, in that example, that you are offering windshields, per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.398" offset="697574">I mean, to give an example, [carmaxDOTcom] offers cars for sale over the Internet, but I don't think we would ordinarily say that they are offering windshields or steering wheels or tires for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.269" offset="737071">Certainly, that's not been necessary construction of a regulatory regime that, say, is designed to focus on sellers of tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.525" offset="762044">It wouldn't automatically, as a matter of law, have to be applied to entities that are selling cars instead.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.312" offset="5609221">The reason why DSL meets the definition of "telecommunications service" and we don't is because the telephone companies do, in fact, provide the transmission-only component.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.283" offset="5661048">Now, the reason they do that, Justice Souter, is, as Mr. Hungar said, historical, though it wasn't without basis in reasons in history, but they do, in fact, provide it separately.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.998" offset="6539912">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.798" offset="6575125">The Court will want to have handy, I think, the red brief of the Respondents Earthlink, et al., because I will repeatedly take you to the text of the statute, which is reproduced at the appendix to that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.507" offset="6626011">Mr. Chief Justice, cable modem service refers to the bundled sale, purely for marketing reasons, of two different things: highspeed telecommunications over cable wires, and computer software, like e-mail, that you can access over that highspeed telecommunications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.654" offset="6702602">The Commission admits... and it is a critical admission... that the standalone sale of the telecommunications piece is a telecommunications service, notwithstanding that it is on cable wires rather than telephone wires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.086" offset="6760281">The Ninth Circuit correctly held that it makes no difference that cable companies market the telecommunications with e-mail and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.166" offset="6792568">Congress cannot have intended to empower carriers to deregulate themselves through the nicety of adding some further feature to their common carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.292" offset="6837081">And I think we can demonstrate that through the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.406" offset="6849620">I'd like to take you to two provisions at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.143" offset="6860487">The first one is on 2a of the appendix, and it goes, Justice Souter, to the question of whether there's some difference that Congress has adopted between telephone wires and cable wires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.240" offset="6904895">And the answer to that question is, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.054" offset="6912209">Subparagraph 46, the definition of "telecommunications service", this is the provision that leads to common-carrier regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.430" offset="6949616">The term "telecommunications service" means</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.011" offset="6959961">"the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.863" offset="6995383">--and here is the critical clause... "regardless of the facilities used".</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.098" offset="7012310">Congress made quite clear it was not drawing any distinction based on cable wire versus telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.874" offset="7035402">I'd like to point you to two other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.113" offset="7044389">They are not reproduced, because they're in the cable... separate cable provisions, but they will be relevant to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.628" offset="7066436">That is 47 USC 541(d) and 522.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.593" offset="7086289">Those specifically contemplate that cable companies will be common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.455" offset="7101753">Now, that's the answer to the question, Is there a difference between a cable wire and a telephone wire?</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.332" offset="7117322">Let me now step back to what the FCC said in its ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.246" offset="7132891">The FCC backed into its decision here, and it will turn on the definition of 1a of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.877" offset="7163507">It said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.629" offset="7166433">Look, cable modem service fits within the definition of an "information service".</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.114" offset="7184405">It's this bundled thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.250" offset="7188898">And we construe the definition of an "information service" to be mutually exclusive of a telecommunications service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.236" offset="7216901">And that is legal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.606" offset="7222335">And let me take you through the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.522" offset="7230067">Subparagraph 20, information service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.908" offset="7243546">The term "information service" means the offering of a capability for, in a variety of things... generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information... via telecommunications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.082" offset="7296313">That is not language of exclusivity; it is language of dependence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.393" offset="7309479">There has to be telecommunications involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.468" offset="7317838">If you all came to the court today via car, or I came via metro, there was a car or a train involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.648" offset="7342498">Now, I want to contrast that with another series of statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.185" offset="7356709">And what these provisions do is demonstrate, beyond peradventure, that Congress address the problem you are now facing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.712" offset="7382831">It said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.059" offset="7384189">"We recognize that there are definitional provisions that might otherwise fall within the definition of "common carriage". " And if we don't want it to be a common carrier, we will tell you expressly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.328" offset="7453257">It's the exclusion that appears at the bottom of the definition, three lines from the bottom,</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.217" offset="8908800">The context for this is the Computer Inquiries and the modified final judgement under AT&amp;T, and they are simply misdescribing the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.790" offset="8947148">And I will take you to the actual quotes for what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.770" offset="8959060">First, let me take you to the definition of a 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.823" offset="9007229">And the point I'm going to make through this is... what the Commission said over and over and over again under the Computer Inquiries... is this, if you have a telecommunications piece, we're going to call it a "basic service".</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.241" offset="9052891">If you add information processing on top of that, we're going to call the whole thing an "enhanced service".</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.451" offset="9073789">So far, everybody's on the same page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.386" offset="9081522">But the piece that they're leaving out is that they made different decisions, policy decisions, Justice Scalia, about how, ultimately, to regulate them, but the definition never changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.241" offset="9120914">If you added the enhancement on it, just like you add the e-mail on top of it, you still had the basic service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.150" offset="9144529">So here's the quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.003" offset="9147977">It's at 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.368" offset="9153411">"We find that basic service is limited to the common-carrier offering. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.077" offset="9228225">And then the Commission and the D.C. Circuit confronted just the problem you are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.694" offset="9246720">What happened is that providers, under the Computer Inquiries and under the modified final judgement, tried to combine the two things and say, "We're no longer regulated".</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.175" offset="9280679">They said,</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.909" offset="11559602">And that is that the Commission is constrained with respect to its expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.842" offset="11579350">But things that are information services that are outside telecommunications, it can do whatever it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.501" offset="11601920">Justice Breyer, I did want to make one additional point, and that is, again, there is a statutory provision here that addresses their claim that they can force you to provide telecommunications service, and that is the definition of a "telecommunications carrier".</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.884" offset="11659494">And it is on 2a.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.234" offset="11664927">I read the exception, so now I'm dealing with the second sentence of the definition,</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.239" offset="11688856">"A telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common carrier under this Act only to the extent that it is engaged in providing telecommunications services. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.420" offset="11721665">This lines up perfectly with this Court's decision in Midwest Video.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.697" offset="11738697">There was a constraint on what it... what regulation you could impose on broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.728" offset="11754893">This one says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.694" offset="11758759">"You are only going to be a common carrier if you're providing a telecommunications service. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.045" offset="11776104">But the FCC has this vision that it can, sort of, solve all the problems through its raw discretion and to force someone to provide common carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.471" offset="11809855">But the statute's very clear, if you are not providing a telecommunications service, you are not going to be a telecommunications carrier; and, therefore, you are not going to be providing common carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.017" offset="11847993">And, as I've said, I don't understand how it is, even if one looked at this particular context, you could decide that Congress thought the bundle made regulation less regulated... less necessary, rather than more regulated... more necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.665" offset="11902642">I want, next, if I could, to talk about the notion that you can self-deregulate, and how utterly implausible this is, how is it that the Commission could imagine that Congress created the following regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.753" offset="11962932">And that is, if you want to provide common carriage, you'll be subject to this regulation; but if you don't feel like it, well, that's okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.006" offset="11991980">That will render the definition of "telecommunications service"... if you just want to tack e-mail onto the thing, that will render the definition of "telecommunications service"... in the Internet, you're a dead letter, because who in the world would ever do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.945" offset="12043703">If it's up to the regulated entity, why in the world would anyone provide common carriage?</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.305" offset="12065123">I think this has, actually, a remarkable parallel to the Court's decision in the Oneida Indian Nation case, where the Court rejected the suggestion that what you could do is... that it would be up to the Indians to decide whether or not they would be able to get property back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.693" offset="12122697">This is what the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.653" offset="12126563">"If OIN may unilaterally reassert sovereign control and remove those parcels from the local tax rolls, little would prevent the tribe from initiating a new generation of litigation to free the parcels. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.470" offset="12169822">--remember, they're free from all regulation at all...</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.400" offset="12177554">"free the parcels from land zone... local zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all landowners in the area. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.999" offset="12199915">And then, Justice Ginsburg, the opinion goes on to talk about section 465, which is exactly like section 10 forbearance,</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.682" offset="12226664">"Recognizing these practical concerns, Congress has provided a mechanism for the acquisition of the lands. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.425" offset="12249652">"The regulations implementing section 465 are sensitive to the complex interjurisdictional concerns that arise when the tribe seeks to retain... regain sovereign control over territory. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.399" offset="12289567">"The Secretary must consider. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.753" offset="12295001">--and it lists a whole series of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.492" offset="12301897">And the parallel, I think, is exact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.423" offset="12309629">You can't have Congress enacting a scheme that tells you how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.862" offset="12323422">Now, let me return to, then, Mr. Cappuccio's suggestion, Justice Scalia, that this is an ingredient, it's not a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.280" offset="12353097">The straightforward answer is, there's no mention of ingredients or products in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.259" offset="12368980">It says "telecommunications service".</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.343" offset="12377339">And the question under the definition of "telecommunications service" is, Are you providing telecommunications?</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.562" offset="12394162">Yeah, the information's going back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.280" offset="12401058">Is it to the public?</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.427" offset="12405656">Sure, anybody can buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.835" offset="12411298">Is there a fee?</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.544" offset="12414119">You bet, it's kind of expensive, actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.101" offset="12420389">And that's all that Congress cared about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.773" offset="12431047">Now, this is not a question of whether or not there's butter in a cake, because you... it... there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.116" offset="12460408">The first is, fundamentally, the telecommunications is the same; it hasn't been "cooked" into something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.670" offset="12478589">And the second--</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.581" offset="12490292">--Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.045" offset="12492173">The second is, the reason all those hypotheticals are... wheels and cars and those sorts of things... don't make any sense here is that they assume a few things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.132" offset="12528431">The first is, they're assuming a first sale that gets regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.295" offset="12541179">Somebody buys the butter, somebody buys the tires and gets regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.412" offset="12557584">But under their rules it's never regulated at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.676" offset="12570645">The telecommunications just, poof, escapes all regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.201" offset="12584751">And the second is that, in the car example, it's because there's... the reason it has intuitive appeal is that there's a regulatory scheme about cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.873" offset="12611396">So Congress has decided how all the inputs will be regulated together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.767" offset="12626965">But, again, remember the consequence of sticking this into the unregulated "information services" box is, it's all gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.914" offset="12655595">There's no regulation of it whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.946" offset="12663745">It's just not a scheme that makes any sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.807" offset="12679210">Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="3174.410" offset="12697600">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.731" offset="12718916">Turning first to the question of the regulatory history, Respondents continue to rely on the fact that, under Computer II, the FCC required telephone common carriers to separate out and separately offer the basic transmission component.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.069" offset="12780251">But, importantly, and what refutes Respondent's attempts to rely on history, Congress did not... excuse me... the FCC did not impose that requirement on enhanced service providers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.418" offset="12825600">There were entities called "value-added networks" that obtained the telecommunications functionality, bundled it together with information servicing protocol conversion-type computer functions, and offered that bundled service as an enhanced service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.852" offset="12887353">And the Commission said, in Computer II,</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.986" offset="12895922">"That is an unregulated enhanced-service offering, it is not subject to Title II of the Act, because we don't think Congress intended Title II, which is aimed at traditional telephone communications, to deal with this new form of intermingled integrated service. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.748" offset="12954958">It is not regulated, even though it is true that there was a communications component.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.063" offset="12972199">And, under Respondent's rationale, that offer or that value-added network should have been required to make it file a tariff and comply with all the regulations of Title II of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.329" offset="13013264">And footnote 5 of our reply brief cites the orders discussing this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.459" offset="13033744">And in addition, under Computer II, the Commission required AT&amp;T and, later, the Regional Bell Operating Companies, if they were going to offer enhanced services, to offer them separately through subsidiaries, unregulated subsidiaries, even though they were offering bundles of enhanced service and telecommunications, the telecommunications, which they obtained under tariff from their parent corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.323" offset="13125277">But the entire bundled offering was unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.544" offset="13138129">And that's been true for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.192" offset="13144712">And, again, Congress, in 1996, gave no indication that it was overturning this well-established situation in which enhanced services, now information services, were not regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.650" offset="13186508">And to suggest that Congress, in an act that talks about preserving the hands-off approach to the Internet, in fact, regulated all Internet Service Providers in a way that they had never been regulated before, we submit, is certainly an unlikely interpretation of the act, and clearly demonstrates that the FCC was reasonable in rejecting that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.954" offset="13267801">Justice Breyer, you asked about voicemail or similar type systems that would preserve a message.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.316" offset="13293192">If provided by a computer functionality, that service is an information service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.950" offset="13319732">Voicemail is an information service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.550" offset="13326106">But the FCC has at least suggested that voicemail and basic telecommunications... if a telephone company tried to offer it... say,</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.997" offset="13367902">"We're going to offer this bundled, and we don't think it's regulated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.578" offset="13378247">telephone companies try that sort of thing from time to time, and then the FCC is faced with a decision, in its discretion, of whether that should be viewed as an integrated offering or, instead, as really two things that have just been added together but aren't really... that are really two distinct services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.846" offset="13431327">And the FCC has suggested, in that context, that telephone service and voicemail service, even if they're bundled together, are two distinct services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.473" offset="13461838">And there's an important difference, I think, between that type of offering and the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.296" offset="13477094">You can use your... even if your telephone company offers you voicemail, obviously, you... a lot of your use of the telephone system has nothing to do with the voicemail; it's pure telephony, pure telecommunications; whereas, with cable modem service, every time you use it, essentially, you are utilizing at least some of the data-processing, computer-enhanced functionality that is being provided by your... by your Internet Service Provider... the domain-name system, as we discussed, caching.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.447" offset="13585763">For instance, Mr. Goldstein says he goes to [supremecourtusDOTgov] every morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.583" offset="13598302">I suspect he doesn't actually go to this Court's computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.364" offset="13613453">He probably gets at least the first page off of the cache, which provided by the ISP.</text>
