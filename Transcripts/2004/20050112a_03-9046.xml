            <text syncTime="53.748" offset="214936">Several Justices of this Court already have endorsed stay and abeyance, and seven of the eight circuit courts of appeals that have considered the issue have permitted stay and abeyance under similar circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.380" offset="265509">Section 2254 and the decisions of this Court in Granberry v. Greer and Strickland v. Washington make clear that exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.593" offset="602279">There is nothing, as Justice Souter noted in his concurrence in Duncan v. Walker, that prohibits the... the granting of a stay under circumstances such as these.</text>

            <text syncTime="1274.353" offset="5097326">The State has expressed concerns about delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.419" offset="5121672">There are four reasons why those concerns are overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.301" offset="5137136">First, in the 3 and a half years since Duncan v. Walker was decided, there have been cases in circuit courts of appeals that have approved of the stay and abeyance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.818" offset="5183216">None of those cases evidence that it is being misused or is causing undue delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.967" offset="5207771">Second, the terms of the stay themselves can restrict a petitioner's delay, as I've already recounted the... the district court did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.484" offset="5253851">Third, this Court in Slack v. McDaniel addressed very similar arguments to what the State is making now about delay through a second habeas filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.168" offset="5300663">And this... this Court noted that the Rules of Civil Procedure vest courts with flexibility to prevent vexatious or delayed litigation and that there are other reasons why those concerns expressed in Slack v. McDaniel were... were overwrought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.151" offset="5360536">Fourth and finally, on the prospect of delay, as already mentioned in answer to one of Justice Scalia's questions, the vast majority of petitioners are not under a capital sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.237" offset="5412885">It is not hyperbole to say that 99.4 percent of Federal section 2254 habeas petitioners are not serving... are not under a capital penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.664" offset="5462622">Those are statistics from the year 2000 from the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.122" offset="5480385">And those, I think with the extremely rare exception, are people who believe rightly or wrongly that they're in prison because their constitutional rights have been violated and would not favor delay under any circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.181" offset="5544647">So the delay concern that the State raises is... is overwrought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.472" offset="5561887">Unless there are other questions, I'd reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.226" offset="5648823">Congress... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.191" offset="5664705">Congress carefully crafted a scheme designed to encourage State prisoners first to exhaust all of their State post-conviction remedies and then to file their habeas corpus petitions as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.680" offset="5722697">The congressional design includes three mutually dependent statutes, including a 1-year statute of limitations, a tolling provision, and a total exhaustion requirement, the combined effect of which is supposed to reduce delay, serve the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.172" offset="5796676">However, stay and abeyance erodes each side of this triangular statutory design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.950" offset="5819768">Stay and abeyance allows tolling in Federal court when Duncan said there should be none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.235" offset="5840875">It extends the statute of limitations beyond 1 year, and it ignores the total exhaustion requirement of 2254(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.036" offset="5872118">The result is that State prisoners, especially capital prisoners, are encouraged to file mixed petitions and rewarded with delay if they do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.434" offset="6769685">I mean, what I have in the statistics is that about 36 percent of all the habeases are dismissed for failure to exhaust, and 93 percent of all of the habeas petitioners are pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.006" offset="6827990">Now, the conclusions I draw for that is it's probably these pro se people... I mean, 93 percent are pro se... that get the procedural dismissals, and certainly a third or so, if we agree with you, of all of the habeas petitions filed in... in Federal court are going to be finished, terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.109" offset="6916389">The door is closed because it takes a Federal court about 9 months on average to process a habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.780" offset="6943033">Now, you just take that and you say, we've closed the door of the Federal court to a third of all the habeas petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="2438.456" offset="9753809">First of all, the... the fact of whether it is without prejudice in fact or in law is driven by how much time is left on the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.026" offset="9796023">A dismissal without prejudice at the time the amended petition was filed in this case would have left 80 days on the statute and he could have pursued his... his remedy in State court and tolled the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.522" offset="9850044">Now, in the... in the more common situation with the habeas petitioner, I think the answer has to be Congress has changed the landscape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.008" offset="9891944">They have changed the landscape relying upon the total exhaustion rule in... that they enacted and that this Court has interpreted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.403" offset="9961535">Now, I think that that simply raises the bar for all petitioners to make doubly sure that if they have a claim, they have presented it to a State court judge because they... they--</text>

            <text syncTime="3064.156" offset="12256549">Mr. Lange, you have 7 minutes left, and normally I wouldn't intrude on your rebuttal time, but I would like to ask you to comment on one thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.180" offset="12300643">Do you think it would be appropriate before a district judge ever grants a stay and... and abeyance procedure, to make some kind of a preliminary, not exactly a probable cause determination, but some kind of a determination as to whether or not there is arguable merit to the State claim that he wants to stay the proceedings to... to allow him to exhaust?</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.621" offset="12378384">Yes, I do, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.440" offset="12385698">I believe that a district court, in evaluating a request for stay and abeyance, should look to make sure that the petition meets the standards of section 2254(b)(2) which is the provision that allows a district court to reach the merits of unexhausted claims to deny them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.026" offset="12472007">It's similar to what the Court has now promulgated as rule 4 of the rules governing habeas corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.980" offset="12499905">I think it makes sense for the district court first to look at... at whether there's merit to the petition because there really is no sense to hold in abeyance, pending exhaustion in State court, claims that lack merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.428" offset="12549642">Obviously, to get stay and abeyance, the petitioner will have had to file timely within his AEDPA period, and the court will have had to have held the case either through the expiration of the AEDPA period or you can imagine some scenarios where on the 364th day--</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.511" offset="12621949">Well, it's one thing to say that there's... it's utterly without merit and he can deny it, which he's entitled to do under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.712" offset="12642847">It's another thing to say that there's a high probability of success on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.180" offset="12744620">It makes sense, under the exhaustion norms of this Court, to let the State courts pass judgment first on claims that have sufficient merit where they can't be disposed of under rule 4 of the rules governing habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.076" offset="12860291">That is to say, it's an extraordinary thing to have Federal district courts in all criminal cases reviewing the work of State supreme courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.332" offset="12893309">We... we got into this in an era when we couldn't trust State supreme courts, especially in racial cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.692" offset="13202704">And these claims... if under the petitioner B scenario, the court had ruled promptly or the claims were less complex, allowing them to be disposed of earlier, Mr. Rhines could have had or... and should have all of his claims before the district court to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.115" offset="13272398">The Court needs to be watchful here not to penalize Mr. Rhines and people who are in similar situations because they have complex claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3367.277" offset="13469048">And stay and abeyance does just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.961" offset="13479811">It prohibits further proceeding on a mixed petition in Federal court and channels, indeed requires, as a term of the order that the petitioner go and exhaust the remaining State remedy and come back to court with one exhausted claim.</text>
