            <text syncTime="9.166" offset="36571">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.239" offset="48901">Though bound by Stanford v. Kentucky, the Missouri Supreme Court rejected both its holding and its rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.659" offset="74606">This Court should stay the course it set in Stanford, leaving in the hands of legislators a determination as to the precise minimum age for capital punishment within the realm of Thompson v. Oklahoma, and leaving to jurors responsibility for determining the culpability of individual defendants above that minimum age.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.318" offset="149211">The Missouri court justified its departure from Stanford on Atkins v. Virginia, but the result it reached is quite different from the result in Stanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.894" offset="187559">In that... excuse me... in Atkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.752" offset="194978">In that case, the Court was addressing mental ability, itself a component of culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.203" offset="216712">The Court announced a principle based on that characteristic, that is, that the mentally retarded are not to be eligible for capital punishment, but then it left to the States the determination of the standard and the means of implementing that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.782" offset="271047">The Missouri Supreme Court, by contrast, jumped beyond the question of maturity, which is an element of culpability analysis, to the arbitrary distinction of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.782" offset="307096">It drew a line based purely on age, which is necessarily over-inclusive, and then it gave that line constitutional status, thus depriving legislators and juries of the ability to evaluate the maturity of 17-year-old defenders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.268" offset="6961006">And just as we allow the mentally retarded the ability to decide whether or not to obtain an abortion but not to be subject to a penalty that is reserved for the tiny fraction of murderers that are so depraved that we call them the worst of the worst, here competency to decide here, as with the mentally retarded, isn't the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.500" offset="7057972">Christopher Simmons was found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed this offense with the specific intent necessary to do it, just as the mentally retarded can be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.953" offset="7155775">In fact, the difference here goes to the factors that Atkins identified about why overwhelmingly the mentally retarded... and here adolescents... are less morally capable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.023" offset="7244069">And here, even more than with the mentally retarded, the few 16 and 17-year-olds who might, if we could even determine it, be... we could determine were in fact so depraved that they were among the worst of the worst, there is no way reliably to identify them and there's no way reliably to exclude them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.081" offset="12208274">And in essence, that creates a contrast with the Lee Malvo case where we had something like what Justice Kennedy referred to, adults influencing a juvenile, and the jury was able to make that distinction in the Virginia Lee Malvo case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.083" offset="12404297">From all that I have read, the evidence both directions is inconclusive, Your Honor, and thus, subject to legislators' determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.228" offset="12448810">Mr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of asking the Court to elevate proportionality to be equivalent to... to a consensus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.130" offset="12480470">But let me just highlight two aspects of the non-capital case proportionality jurisprudence of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.686" offset="12502727">Justice Kennedy, in... in Harmelin recently cited by the plurality in Ewing, pointed out that two of the considerations in proportionality review in those instances are the primacy of the legislature and the nature of the Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.029" offset="12552046">What we should have here is a principle that is a principle dealing with immaturity, and the States, within the Federal system, should be able to make the determination as to how to implement it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.599" offset="12594364">As pointed out, this Court's jurisprudence in Eighth Amendment areas has proven to be a one-way ratchet, and because of that, the Court has to be very wary of leading rather than reflecting societal norms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.609" offset="12642429">Now, there are some States, of course, that have raised the age, the minimum age, for capital punishment, but at least in some instances, such as Missouri, that is a reaction to this Court's jurisprudence, that is, a reaction to Thompson and Stanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.272" offset="12697078">Other States have left 18 for other purposes, and yet there still is a role by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.467" offset="12721842">Pornography is an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.581" offset="12726230">I am confident that but for this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, the Missouri General Assembly would adopt a statute that said that pornography should not be allowed at ages much higher than 18 and not because of maturity, but because of their opposition to pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.928" offset="12791641">In many of the instances cited by Mr. Simmons, the kind of statutes that he cites, gambling and others, it is a compromise in the legislative arena, not necessarily based on maturity or immaturity, that leads to the selection of the age of 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.333" offset="12849319">Many States have, of course, individualized determinations with regard to those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.361" offset="12873352">There was a discussion of driver's licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.135" offset="12880457">In Missouri, of course, we allow people to drive at age 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.056" offset="12896131">They have to have parental consent, yes, but there also is a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.194" offset="12908774">That is, there is an individualized determination before we do that, and that's what the State requests here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.395" offset="12929567">Mr. Simmons' counsel points out that in Atkins the Court took judicial notice of psychosocial evidence, and that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.403" offset="12961541">The Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.024" offset="12964049">But remember that what the Court had before it in Atkins was not a proxy for a... a factor that plays into culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.455" offset="12993724">It was, in fact, the factor itself, that is mental capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.739" offset="13014936">And what they want here is not a determination as to the maturity or the capacity of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.229" offset="13036878">They want a bright line test that is based purely on age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.201" offset="13048790">This Court should adopt, as it did in Atkins, a principle and leave it to the States to act.</text>
