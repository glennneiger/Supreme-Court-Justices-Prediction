            <text syncTime="1422.953" offset="5691768">And in a significant percentage of the cases... I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my head... after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel then concludes that there is no merit, that there are no grounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got whatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining, at which point then either a motion to withdraw may be filed or... or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of an Anders brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.422" offset="5781629">And so that is done in a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.667" offset="5790616">It is our position that that procedure actually helps improve the appellate process in Michigan because without that process, all you have are indigents like Mr. Halbert, a special education student with mental disabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall... and filing, in... in his case, with the help of a fellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself... the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is completely incoherent, misses several issues that are right on the face of the record, correctly asserts that his sentencing guidelines were misscored but... but without explaining why, without even identifying which sentencing guidelines were misscored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.920" offset="5931677">And in fact, he received a minimum sentence that was approximately three times too high under the sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.400" offset="5957590">The State concedes that one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in the State's favor erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.653" offset="5978593">We concede one of the... one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in Mr. Halbert's favor erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.506" offset="5997923">But then there were two others, and the most important ones, the OV, Offense Variable, 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.626" offset="6018403">That was scored for 25 points in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.293" offset="6029166">And so Mr.... Mr. Halbert, in fact, received a sentence that was much too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.191" offset="6044735">Michigan requires... Michigan is one of the few States that requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.055" offset="6080157">And so at that point, Mr. Halbert had to figure out a way to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing, which requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still available to be called, all from prison, and there was no possible way he could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.501" offset="6149956">So it's not very surprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate, that his application for leave to appeal was completely incoherent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.994" offset="6179944">The fellow inmate actually did write the... the trial judge and say we need to have an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.927" offset="6207634">But under the statute, the judge had no discretion to grant that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.500" offset="6221949">Under the statute, only if there was already an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines, only then would the judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course, the guidelines, as misscored without objection from defense counsel... there was no upward departure at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.020" offset="6284016">If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.100" offset="6348382">I want to start with the factual claim regarding the waiver that the Court identified, pages 22 and 23 from the joint appendix, being the point at which Mr. Halbert, in fact, waived his right to the appointment of appellate counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.863" offset="6399373">I think Justice Scalia is right in noting that he was told specifically it's under these conditions you'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, you might be appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.642" offset="6442527">From context it's unambiguous that he would otherwise not receive counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.708" offset="6462798">And what's important is at the joint appendix on page 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.487" offset="6497907">So in order for this Court to conclude that Mr. Halbert did not waive his right to appellate counsel under the particular circumstances, you would have... you would have to conclude that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its factual finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.391" offset="11173512">Like the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of this Michigan statute in the Tesmer case, petitioner's attempt to invalidate that statute here runs counter to this Court's longstanding tradition of deference to the people of the individual States and to their legislatures in the design and implementation of their criminal justice systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.127" offset="11256477">As the Court said in Coleman v. Thompson, a case like this is a case about federalism because it involves the respect that Federal courts must pay to States and the States' procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.743" offset="11302870">Respect for the State's choices is especially important here because, as the Court put it in Medina v. California, preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.012" offset="11355951">Therefore, the Court said we should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to intrude upon the administration of justice by the individual States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.796" offset="11391164">And... and as to the question of... of when to provide State-paid counsel, as Justice O'Connor reminded us in Murray v. Giarratano, that's a choice that should be one of legislative choice, especially since it involves difficult policy considerations and the allocation of scarce legal resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.436" offset="11933675">21 of them rule it out entirely and expressly, and another 17 effectively rule out appeals from plea-based convictions by... by allowing prosecutors to impose that... impose a waiver as a condition of entering into a plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.222" offset="13380859">Also, if you... if you subsidize litigation in the name of providing adequate access to courts or meaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a lot of litigation in the lower Federal courts about exactly how much of a subsidy is necessary reach that standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.130" offset="13460480">If you require States to subsidize the exercise of a right that they're not required to provide in the first place, like the right to seek review of a... of a plea-based conviction, then you give the States a strong incentive to cut back on or eliminate that right altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.586" offset="13586286">I have to begin by correcting several misstatements of fact and of Michigan law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.573" offset="13606243">First of all, Mr. Schaerr just said that only a dozen States, I believe, allow for appeals from guilty pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.157" offset="13628604">That's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.951" offset="13631739">Every State in the United States currently allows for appeals from guilty plea... pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.548" offset="13650129">The Bulger case did say that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3417.711" offset="13670818">As I cited in my brief, a number of States allow for applications or petitions from guilty pleas, but every State has a first tier direct appeal from guilty pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.967" offset="13703837">The Bulger... the Michigan Supreme Court in Bulger cited a... an article from an Arizona Attorney magazine that was simply incorrect on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.291" offset="13737064">Secondly, on the issue of what is the effect of a order denying leave to appeal for lack of merit on the grounds presented, the State continues to rely on McKenzie v. Smith, an earlier Sixth Circuit opinion, People v. Berry, and Bobenal v. Saginaw Investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.678" offset="13790668">None of those cases uses the phrase, lack of merit on the grounds presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.169" offset="13808640">That phrase does not appear in any of those three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.033" offset="13820029">The Berry and the Bobenal cases, those are Michigan Court of Appeals cases before 1981. Beginning in 1981, in a series of three cases, People v. Douglas, People v. Hayden, and People v. Wiley, the Michigan Court of Appeals held unambiguously that our orders denying applications or remand orders, in that case, for lack of merit on the grounds presented, was law of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.268" offset="14216986">But all of those appeals are still decided on the merits with preclusive effect for law of the case purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.754" offset="14243004">And the Sixth Circuit specifically dealt with that in... in the Abela case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.966" offset="14267768">McKenzie v. Smith never... never mentions anything about the lack of merit in the grounds presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="3583.142" offset="14332552">But what Michigan cannot do, as a result of Ellis and Douglas, is for that first gatekeeping part of the appeal, which is where the court has to decide is there merit in this case, to make the indigent shift for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.649" offset="14382498">And so in... in Smith v.
