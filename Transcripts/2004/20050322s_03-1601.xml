            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The opinion of the Court in No. 03-1601, the City of Rancho Palos Verdes versus Abrams will be announced by Justice Scalia.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="13.200" stopTime="454.246">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="13.200" offset="52767">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.239" offset="68859">The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which is called TCA, limited the traditional authority of state and local governments to regulate the location and construction of antenna towers.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.854" offset="127373">Under 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7), state and local governments may not among other things discriminate among providers of “functionally equivalent wireless services” or take actions that “prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.”</text>
            <text syncTime="56.633" offset="226429">They must act on request for authorization to locate wireless facilities within a reasonable period of time and each decision denying such request must be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record, and as a central to this case, Section 332(c)(7)(B)(V) provides that if local governments fail to abide by these provisions “any person adversely affected may within 30 days commence and action in any court of competent jurisdiction".</text>
            <text syncTime="98.282" offset="393091">Respondent Mark Abrams is a resident of petitioner, the City of Rancho Palos Verdes, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.718" offset="422870">Throughout the 1990s, he installed several radio towers of up to 50 feet in height on the property allowing him to operate contrary to zoning laws a successful commercial radio transmission business.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.085" offset="496327">In 1999, when the city discovered that respondent was using his antennas in a commercial business, it obtained an injunction in State Court ordering him to desist.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.865" offset="543451">Abrams sought a conditional use permit from the city to allow him to resume using his antennas commercially but the city denied the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.422" offset="581590">Thereupon, Abrams filed suit in Federal Court alleging that the denial of the permit violated the limitations placed on the city’s zoning authority by the TCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.711" offset="622759">He contended that he was permitted to enforce this statutory rights and this is the significant part under both the TCA itself and under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.081" offset="684304">The latter provision he claimed allowed him to recover as the TCA on its face does not money damages and attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.961" offset="731742">The District Court agreed with respondent and city was not violation of the Act in order the city to issue respondent a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.247" offset="756924">The court did not agree however that respondent was entitled to damages or attorney’s fees under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.068" offset="784196">Respondent appealed the latter holding and the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.074" offset="800287">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.514" offset="810005">Section 1983 imposes liability on anyone who under color of state law deprives another person of the rights guaranteed to him by the constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.774" offset="863086">We have held that this provision permits suits for deprivation of rights conferred by Federal Statute only when the statute creates an individually enforceable right, and if the plaintiff makes this showing the state act, here defendant, may still demonstrate that 1983 is not available by showing that Congress did not intended as a remedy for the newly created right.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.791" offset="967158">Evidence of such intent may be expressed in the statute or as we held in cases called Middlesex County Sewerage Authority versus National Sea Clammers Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.304" offset="1025149">It may be inferred from the existence of an alternative enforcement scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.615" offset="1054407">The Court of Appeals assumed that the TCA created individually enforceable rights in respondent and the city does not question that determination here.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.800" offset="1091187">The critical question is whether Congress meant the judicial remedy expressly authorized by the TCA to co-exist with the alternative remedy available under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.130" offset="1144477">We hold that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.136" offset="1152522">The provision of an expressed private means of redressing the statute will ordinarily indicate that Congress did not mean to leave open a more extensive remedy under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.168" offset="1200588">Indeed, the existence of a more restrictive private remedy has been redividing line between those cases in which we have held that an action will lie under 1983 and those in which we have held that it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.911" offset="1255549">Nevertheless, we do not accept the government suggestion that the availability of a private judicial remedy conclusively establishes a congressional intent to preclude 1983 relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.028" offset="1304033">The ordinary inference of the remedy provided in the statute is exclusive may surely be overcome by textual indication either express or implicit that the remedy is to compliment rather than plan Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.058" offset="1364219">There is however no such indication in the relevant remedial provisions of the TCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.565" offset="1386162">Section 332(c)(7)(B)(V) adds no remedies to those available under 1983 and limits relief in ways that section 1983 does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.293" offset="1429107">It requires aggrieved persons to seek judicial review of zoning decisions within 30 days of a final action, and once an action is filed that mandates at the court herein and decided on an expedited basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.440" offset="1473724">The remedies available moreover certainly do not include attorney’s fees and costs and may not include compensatory damages a question on which we do not rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.146" offset="1516565">A 1983 action by contrast can be brought much later than 30 days after the final action and need not be heard and decided on an expedited basis and the successful plaintiff may recover not only damages but reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.076" offset="1584274">In sum, if a plaintiff could enforce the rights created by the TCA through section 1983, he could whenever convenient circumvent the scheme of expedited judicial review and limited remedies created by the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.504" offset="1645923">For these reasons and others expressed in our opinion today, we hold that the TCA by providing a juridical remedy different from 1983 in the Act itself precluded resort to section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.407" offset="1697541">Accordingly, we reversed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.509" offset="1709976">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion in which Justices O’Connor, Souter, and Ginsburg have joined; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
