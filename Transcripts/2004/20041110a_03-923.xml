            <text syncTime="6.937" offset="27690">Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.107" offset="44408">This Court has made clear on several occasions, including 21 years ago in Place and 4 years ago in Edmond, that a sniff by a drug-detection dog is not a Fourth Amendment search, and if something is neither a search nor a seizure, then it requires no Fourth Amendment justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="30.881" offset="123507">Well, we've held that it's certainly not a... a full-blown search.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.884" offset="139494">It's not a search in the classic sense, but a Terry stop isn't an arrest in... in the classic sense either.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.822" offset="167288">We... we have said that that is a kind of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.438" offset="177737">Why do... I think your... your argument assumes that this for... for purposes of search analogies that something is either a... a full-dress search or it's not a search at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.713" offset="230818">Why isn't there a... a possibility of... of a kind of middle ground searches just as there is on seizures?</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa Madigan</label>
            <text syncTime="65.803" offset="263210">Well, this Court made clear in Arizona v. Hicks that it did not want to go down the road of creating something known as a quasi-search so that courts and police officers would be in the position of trying to determine whether or not something was a search or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.059" offset="332173">Oh, I... I can... I can just imagine the problems, but I mean, what... I think what's... what the... what's bothering me about the case is that if we persist in... in saying that... that it's... that it's an either and or question with no question with no possible gradation, then I assume nothing prevents the police from taking the dogs through every municipal garage in the United States and I suppose there's nothing that prevents the police from taking the dogs up to any homeowner's door, ringing the bell, and seeing if the dog gets a sniff of something when the door is opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.985" offset="487863">We're... we're opening rather a... a large vista for... for dog intrusions, and... and that's what's... that's what's bothering me.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.985" offset="523912">Why... why should we... why should we open that vista if there is a possibility of a... of a middle ground that would prevent it?</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa Madigan</label>
            <text syncTime="137.672" offset="550661">Well, I would start with the reality that dog sniffs by their very nature, as this Court recognized in both Place and Edmond, are very unique both in terms of the manner in which the sniff is conducted, as well as the content of... of the information that the sniff reveals, so that a dog sniff is only going to be able to reveal the presence or absence of contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.082" offset="660271">And this Court has recognized that individuals have no privacy interest in the possession of contraband.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.394" offset="705515">If we say, as you urge, a dog sniff is not a search, then the police are free to parade up and down every street in the country with dogs sniffing car trunks.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.627" offset="766433">Because a sniff is not a search, a police officer would be able to take a narcotics-detection dog down the street with him or her.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.973" offset="795794">I can tell you that because of the limited resources... and this is a point brought up in the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police amicus brief... that that is not likely to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.459" offset="837799">In addition, I can also tell you that in the State of Illinois, the Illinois State police do not train their dogs nor do they use their dogs on people.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.035" offset="876042">They only use them on objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.727" offset="882834">But yes, in answer to both of your questions, because a dog sniff does not constitute a search, dogs could be used to walk down streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.758" offset="922958">They could, hypothetically, be used in parking lots, and at times they are used in parking lots.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa Madigan</label>
            <text syncTime="3185.887" offset="12743471">Thank you, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.034" offset="12752039">Let me make three brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.634" offset="12762488">Number one, Justice Ginsburg asked a question about something that was in the respondent's brief, whether or not it made a difference if a dog was with Master Sergeant Gillette when he initiated the stop or if the dog was later brought, as was the case here, by Trooper Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.061" offset="12848170">Really what Mr. Caballes is arguing for here is an inadvertence requirement which this Court very clearly held in Horton, there is no such requirement of inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.451" offset="12901773">And so a law officer, if they are at a lawful vantage point, do have the ability to detect incriminating facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.352" offset="12937404">That is not something that has to occur inadvertently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.696" offset="12950779">It can happen intentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.182" offset="12956630">Second, Justice Scalia asked a question about plain view, and similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not effect an incremental search or seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.449" offset="13001770">And therefore, similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not require Fourth Amendment justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.508" offset="13029982">And let me finally acknowledge something that Justice Souter brought up, which is whether or not, by walking a dog around a house, you in fact would have a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.625" offset="13086407">Let me... now, that is certainly a closer case than whether walking a dog around a car constitutes a search, which we say is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.593" offset="13118276">But ultimately you would reach a similar result because the principle is not going to extend to cars in the same manner in... in Kyllo as the thermal imager did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.339" offset="13173342">Finally, if there are no further questions, we would ask that the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court be reversed.</text>
