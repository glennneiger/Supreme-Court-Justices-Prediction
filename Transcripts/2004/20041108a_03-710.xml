            <text syncTime="1120.310" offset="4481149">I believe that what Whren teaches is that the subjective working of the police officer's mind, his motives, his intentions, his legal assessments, as in other cases, his legal assessment with respect to the extent of a consent to search, or the reason he's boarding a boat, is irrelevant, that that's for courts to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.237" offset="4564846">What matters is what came into an officer's brain, not what came out as a result of his working on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1155.855" offset="4623360">And those similarly situated would be treated very, very differently, depending upon what an officer chose to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.344" offset="4645303">And as I said, silence in a... in a jurisdiction that's governed by the closely related offense doctrine is the best course.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.362" offset="5101401">And that's illustrated by imagining three stops on that road that night, three Mr. Alfords, exact same facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.851" offset="5123344">In one, the officer is engaged in the process that he engaged in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.740" offset="5134942">In the other two, the officer chooses in the first to say nothing, and in the third, to say... hold up the code book and say what you did is in here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.688" offset="5210697">That to me demonstrates that it is essentially subjective because it is driven not by the facts, what the defendant did, but by the nature of the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.400" offset="5245597">Is he clever?</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.654" offset="11174557">And the trial... I mean, it was very clear that the two were treated as discrete incidents by the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.945" offset="11227742">When I saw the recorder in the record mode and saw that it was moving, that's what he stated to him constituted probable cause for the arrest.</text>
