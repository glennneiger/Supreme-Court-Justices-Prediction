            <text syncTime="179.571" offset="718263">So it may be many years before the situation arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.401" offset="737593">This is not a concrete and particularized actual or imminent injury in fact, and we've argued that in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.946" offset="771762">At... at best, if there is an injury in fact and if there is... another factor is the close relationship to the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.209" offset="800810">We believe those are weak at best, and we've argued in our brief that they don't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.750" offset="818991">I think it is most clear, however, that the criteria concerning the hindrance to the third party does not exist here.</text>
