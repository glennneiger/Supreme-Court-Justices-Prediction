            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3.383" offset="13479">This case presents a question of statutory interpretation thus the truth in Lending Act as amended in 1995 caps statutory damages in addition to any proven actual damages and $1,000.00 for violation of the Act's requirements for consumer loans secured by personal property in this case a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.643" offset="118491">The truth and Lending Act instruct lenders to disclose certain information to borrowers and imposes civil liability on lenders who fail to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.691" offset="158720">As originally enacted in 1968 the Act set double the amount of the finance charge as statutory damages with this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.641" offset="198531">For each violation Congress specify the minimum recovery of $100.00 and maximum damages of $1,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.123" offset="232490">Congress amended the Act in the 1970's dividing the statutory damages provision in two clauses: Clause (i) sets statutory damages for long transaction at double the amount of the finance judge, and clause (ii) set damages for lease transactions at 25% of the monthly payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.208" offset="312738">Congress retained the $100.00 floor and $1,000.00 dollar ceiling on recovery, and courts consistently held that these limits apply to all consumer financing transactions whether lease or loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.886" offset="371461">In 1995, Congress again amended the act by adding a new clause (iii) which increase the limit on recovery but only for violations relating to closed-end mortgage loans commonly home acquisition loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.448" offset="437708">In lieu of the $100.00 minimum and $1,000.00 maximum Congress substituted $200.00 and $2,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.615" offset="470413">Bradley Nigh the respondent here plaintiff below maintains that the 1995 amendment had a further more dramatic effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.374" offset="505417">Elimination of the $1,000.00 cap on damages recoverable under clause (i).</text>
            <text syncTime="131.985" offset="527882">Nigh attempted to buy a truck from petitioner Koons Buick the financing for the truck well through causing Nigh to lose both that truck and the vehicle Nigh has traded for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.109" offset="576366">Nigh commence suit asserting that Koons Buick among other wrongs has violated the Truth in Lending Act by falsely listing a charge of $965.00 for a car alarm Nigh did not order or received.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.680" offset="630700">A jury returned a verdict ordering Nigh double the amount of the finance charge in dollars approximately $24,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.714" offset="662779">The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that award holding as Nigh urged that the 1995 amendment removed the $1,000.00 cap on recoveries under clause (i) of the statutory damages provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.545" offset="722129">We reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and hold that the 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100.00 floor and $1,000.00 ceiling on recoveries under clause (i).</text>
            <text syncTime="193.209" offset="772807">Less than meticulous drafting of the 1995 amendment created and ambiguity the phrase prescribing the $100.00 floor and $1,000.00 ceiling located at the end of clause (ii) reads, except that liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100.00 nor greater than $1,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.654" offset="862563">Congress ordinarily follows a hierarchical scheme in subdividing statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.060" offset="884193">The word subparagraph generally refers to a division preceded by a capital letter the word clause to a division preceded by a lower case roman number.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.525" offset="930064">The three clauses at issue, all in lower case roman numbers, appear in a subparagraph preceded by capital "a".</text>
            <text syncTime="241.767" offset="967053">Had congress meant to restrict the $100.00 floor and the $1,000.00 ceiling to clause (ii) of subparagraph "a"?</text>
            <text syncTime="249.990" offset="999863">It likely would have flagged that substitute change at least Congress might have stated in clause (ii) liability under this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.433" offset="1041659">The statutory history cast lie down on Congress's meaning the $100.00 floor and $1,000.00 ceiling from the start have applied to loans in the clause (i) category.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.167" offset="1084604">The new clause (iii) removes closed-end mortgage loans from clause (i)'s governance only to the extent that clause (iii) raises the minimum and maximum recoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.879" offset="1127445">There is scant indication that by raising the minimum and maximum recoveries for mainly home acquisition mortgage loans Congress meant thereby to repeal the dollar limitation on all other loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.642" offset="1182511">We therefore conclude that the $100.00 floor and $1,000.00 ceiling continue to apply to recoveries for Truth In Lending Act violations involving loans described in clause (i) and leases described in clause (ii).</text>
            <text syncTime="311.135" offset="1244473">Indicating the large interest the statutory construction case has generated Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Breyer joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.066" offset="1284180">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion in which the Chief Justice joins; Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, and Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
