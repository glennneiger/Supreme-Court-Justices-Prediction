            <text syncTime="7.584" offset="30302">This Case No. 03-8661 is here on writ of certiorari to the Appeals of Court of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.766" offset="71053">The petitioner was tried in Massachusetts Superior Court on several criminal charges, one of which was unlawful possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.175" offset="108669">Under the state statute, to prove that possession offense the prosecution had to establish that petitioner possessed a weapon with a barrel less than 16 inches long.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.695" offset="158720">The only evidence from that point was the shooting victims testimony that petitioner had shot him with a pistol or a revolver.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.862" offset="191425">When the prosecution concluded its evidence petitioner move for a required finding of not guilty, which under Massachusetts procedure is an acquittal by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.322" offset="233221">Out of the jury’s presence, the judge granted the motion as to the firearm count because she thought the prosecution had presented “not a scintilla of evidence” that the firearm had a barrel shorter than 16 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.449" offset="293721">The prosecution rested and the defense case proceeded on the remaining counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.055" offset="316186">After petitioner and his codefendant arrested, the prosecution persuaded the judge that her earlier ruling had been wrong because a Massachusetts precedent established unsurprisingly that the statement that a gun was a pistol was sufficient to show that it had a barrel less than 16 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.927" offset="395703">The judge announced that she was reversing her previous ruling and letting the firearm count go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.790" offset="419109">Petitioner was convicted on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.118" offset="432379">The Appeals Court of Massachusetts affirmed that conviction rejecting petitioner’s argument that he had been subjected to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.876" offset="475429">The Appeals Court held that nothing in the double jeopardy clause prohibits a trial judge from reconsidering her own ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.169" offset="504581">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk we the reverse the judgment of the Appeals Court and hold that petitioner was subjected to double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.758" offset="538958">We have repeatedly held that an acquittal by a judge precludes reexamination of the defendant’s guilt no less than an acquittal by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.069" offset="572186">The judge's ruling in this case met the definition of an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.465" offset="585770">It held that the prosecution had failed to prove a factual element of the offense charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.714" offset="606772">Because petitioner was acquitted, the subsequent submission of the case to the jury amounted to an impermissible second jeopardy unless the Constitution permits the judge to reconsider her own mid trial ruling of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.914" offset="659644">In this case, petitioner had no reason to doubt that the State Court’s ruling was a final one.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.632" offset="682527">It was not labeled as tentative.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.443" offset="689737">Indeed, state procedure required the judge to make a ruling on petitioner’s motion before the defendants began their case, nor was there any state procedural rule on the book that allowed the judge to reconsider her ruling if she became convince that her legal conclusion had been wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.336" offset="757342">The state rules provided only for the correction of clerical errors or errors “arising from oversight or omission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="198.644" offset="794540">Massachusetts identifies a few State Court cases that permit reconsideration of interlocutory rulings such as rulings on pretrial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.505" offset="833933">But these precedence does not clearly extent to a judge’s findings of not guilty which is not interlocutory because it purports to terminate that count of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.872" offset="883461">We think that the state can by stature rule or common law provide that mid trial judgment of acquittal are subject to reconsideration, but if an acquittal by all appearances is final it may induce a defendant to make strategic choices that would be prejudicial if the acquittal may reconsidered later in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.579" offset="958276">For example, establishing the defense to the remaining counts may make it useful for him to admit his guilt on the acquitted count.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.391" offset="993489">The Double Jeopardy Clause's guarantee cannot be allowed to become a potential snare for those who reasonably rely upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.858" offset="1023373">Massachusetts has not shown that the judges finding of not guilty was automatically or even presumptively non-final.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.775" offset="1051063">At most it has shown that the finding was legally incorrect but the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits reexamination of acquittals even when they are plainly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.944" offset="1091709">For these reasons and others expressed in our opinion today, we hold that petitioner’s rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.931" offset="1119713">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appeals Court of Massachusetts and we remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.808" offset="1151164">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Kennedy and Breyer have joined.</text>
