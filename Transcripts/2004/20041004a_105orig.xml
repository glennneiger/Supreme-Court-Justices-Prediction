            <label>Mr. John B. Draper</label>
            <text syncTime="7.430" offset="29675">Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.593" offset="50364">Kansas would like to address three issues today.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.140" offset="64470">50 years of success of the Court's river master on the Delaware River and 16 years of success of the Court's river master on the Pecos River demonstrate the wisdom of appointing a river master under appropriate circumstances on a river like the Arkansas River, which is the subject of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.294" offset="141166">Secondly, the Court should affirm the neutral principle that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages owing at the time interest begins to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.748" offset="178991">And third, a 1-year compliance period would be consistent with the Court's prior rulings in this case and would preserve an essential right of Kansas and its farmers under this... this compact that would otherwise be lost under the master's recommendation of a 10-year accounting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.407" offset="253597">With respect to this accounting period, I would note that in both prior opinions in this case, this Court has relied on the annual results of the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, which is the standard for compact compliance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.208" offset="320784">In the first opinion in 1995, this Court distinguished between monthly and... and seasonal use of the model, deciding that monthly use was too frequent, but that seasonal reliance on the model for determining useability under article IV-D of the compact was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.270" offset="401032">When the case was back here in 2001, this Court reviewed the calculation of damages, which was done on a yearly basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.030" offset="440111">As you can imagine, the factors that go into calculation of damages vary from year to year, and so it is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the H-I Model, as it's called, are accurate, sufficiently accurate, and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.917" offset="6583589">I think I will begin by discussing the river master since that's where Mr. Draper left off.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.992" offset="6647954">The Pecos River Compact did, in fact, specifically state that it was... it intended to hold the level of... of depletion of the system by man's development to the 1947 condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.492" offset="6693930">The Arkansas River Compact, to the contrary, begins the... the limitation clause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas Basin, provided that the waters of the Arkansas River are not materially depleted in useable quantity for existing use for the uses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.129" offset="11424496">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.440" offset="11469740">It's the position of the United States that... that we agree with Colorado and with the special master that a river master should not be appointed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.781" offset="11503073">The compact between the States of Kansas and Colorado sets up a commission that is responsible for implementing the obligations in that compact, which has to do with Colorado's obligations to deliver a certain amount of water to Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.958" offset="11551765">The commission is also charged with investigating violations of the compact, and the compact includes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to binding arbitration if the... the States agree to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.218" offset="11600771">The... the commission also certainly could use other dispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the authority to do if it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.110" offset="11628356">The States have agreed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.884" offset="11635461">Congress has enacted it into law, and this Court should permit the parties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that might arise in the future rather than putting a river master in place under the authority of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.971" offset="11687811">Now, the Court has... itself has frequently stated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort is preferable to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.191" offset="11724696">As the special master pointed out, in the two river basins just north of the Arkansas River, the Republican River and the Platte River, the parties recently, after having a dispute, including these very same two States in one of them, have come to a consensual resolution of the dispute that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.258" offset="11797002">And I think that does show, as the special master pointed out, that these... the States can... in fact, the disputes in those cases also had to do with groundwater and the effect of well pumping, among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.205" offset="11836813">As the special master pointed out, I think that shows that the States can use a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution, and this Court ought to continue its often-stated preference for consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to problems of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.410" offset="11909538">If the Court were to appoint a river master in this case, then I think the question would arise in any future case in which you have two States that have conflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity, as what happened with river compacts, equitable apportionments, and in other areas, whenever there's an inherently conflicting interest, the Court would have an appeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree or judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.247" offset="11996891">And I think rather than... that... that would be directly contrary to the Court's other statement in the area, which is not only that the Court prefers and that it's far preferable to have consensual resolutions, but also that the Court does not favor appointing agents or functionaries to carry out its decrees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.389" offset="12061466">So I guess we made a mistake with respect to the Pecos River and what was the other one?</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.135" offset="12080483">Delaware?</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3020.385" offset="12081528">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.961" offset="12083827">The Pecos River... I mean, there were a couple of differences, in addition to the ones that Mr. Robbins pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.058" offset="12104202">One difference is that not only the special master, but the parties in the Pecos River case... neither party objected to the appointment of a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of clothing the master with authority to make determinations that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.190" offset="12164702">In this case, there is a party that objects to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.891" offset="12175464">And I would... I think there's another difference that's important that the Court ought to keep in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.165" offset="12192601">At the time the Pecos River master was appointed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e), which the Court has said that the Federal rules provide a guide for this Court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and the Court, indeed, used that mechanism for the... it provided that the river master in that case would be reviewed under that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.942" offset="12287687">As of 2003, rule 53... it's now rule 53(g)... provides that masters appointed by district courts said their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo standard unless the parties agree otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.408" offset="12337528">Therefore, at the present time... and again, following the Court's rule 17.2 that says that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be guides... and I think they are a useful guide... the appropriate course here, if the Court were to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one whose findings will be reviewable de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.519" offset="12398028">But that itself raises problems because if the findings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's really just a continuation of the current litigation and it doesn't really advance things any.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.004" offset="12439928">The parties will submit the evidence to the river master.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.643" offset="12450482">He'll make his determinations, and then they'll come to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.872" offset="12459468">That's really more what the special master does at the current time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.466" offset="12473783">So I think that under all of those circumstances, both the Court's preference for a consensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of appointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the Court's recognition that it's the Court's obligation to decide cases of this sort and it can't... it's not the obligation of other parties to do that, and the commission that Congress has put into place specifically to deal with this kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute resolution, I think that the Court should not appoint a river master in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.160" offset="12604604">As far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's the position of the United States also that the special master and Colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest should not be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.934" offset="12647654">I think it's a familiar principle in... to this Court in litigation that if a party... when the time comes to make objections, a party has to make all of its objections if it wants the Court to hear them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.194" offset="12696764">In this case, the special master came up with a recommendation in his third report about how to... what should happen with prejudgment interest, under which the early years... the... the amount of the damages in those early years would never be subject to prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.071" offset="12756219">Now, Kansas objected to that and said we should move the year back to 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.157" offset="12772624">We should get prejudgment interest on everything back to year one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.401" offset="12785580">But they never made the objection that if you... if the Court disagrees with that, which it did, that the method that the master had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969 was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.867" offset="12835422">That was the time that Kansas should have brought it to the Court and Kansas didn't do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.253" offset="13617006">--Well, we were... we were arguing the larger issues on interest, but we were asking that interest not be denied to us during that '50 through 1968 period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.596" offset="13666325">That was very clear from our briefs, and we specifically singled out that part of it in that footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.337" offset="13685342">So I don't believe it's appropriate that... to conclude that we have waived that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.113" offset="13712405">And I would point out also that the only reason that it was done that way... and the calculations of the parties did... did in connection with that review... is because the special master required it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.441" offset="13757753">There is no other reason that we did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.776" offset="13767053">We did not volunteer to do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.800" offset="13775099">We did not like doing it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.286" offset="13781055">The master said that's the way it's going to be in my recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.463" offset="13793802">How much would that amount to?</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.942" offset="13803729">We did not agree in any way to that part of the calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.937" offset="13827657">I would also point out that with respect to the amounts involved, that you need to be careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.893" offset="13859527">The amounts cited by Mr. Robbins are not from the same year.</text>
