            <text syncTime="11.107" offset="44408">The petitioners in this case are American citizens who took cruises to and from this country on tickets bought here that call for the application of U.S. law.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.395" offset="81502">They were subject to discrimination by respondent, a U.S. based company on the land, in the ports, and in the waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.607" offset="114416">The question presented is whether the Americans With Disabilities Act applies or instead whether respondent's conduct is lawful because the case is controlled by Bahamian law, which freely permits cruise lines to discriminate against persons with disabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="43.179" offset="172617">Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire of you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU area, have applied their own disability laws to some of the cruise ships that touch base in their courts?</text>

            <text syncTime="58.662" offset="234580">Justice O'Connor, our research does not reveal that the question has arisen in the EU.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.066" offset="256209">I can, however, provide you some information, and that is that... two points I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.710" offset="274808">The first is they subscribe... the members of the EU subscribe to the same conventions and to UNCLOS just the way we do, which gives the port state plenary authority within its ports and internal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.592" offset="326322">And I have a couple of case citations for you on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.685" offset="338651">In the ECJ, the Diva Navigation case, 1992, ECR I-6019.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.168" offset="400614">It has not arisen in the EU, but it has arisen in Australia.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.459" offset="417750">Australia has a disability law.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.976" offset="427886">It applies that law to cruise ships, and the rule in Australia is that the port state law applies rather than the flag state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.347" offset="465293">And the citation for that is the Union Shipping case, 2002, NSWCA 124 CA 40379/01.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.865" offset="511373">I don't know what those numbers mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.228" offset="516911">And would you also address at some point how the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea would affect the resolution here?</text>
            <text syncTime="138.805" offset="555154">For example, it has, as I understand it, requirements that there be watertight doors and those doors have to be set above the level of the floor so you couldn't roll a handicapped wheelchair or something over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.480" offset="629864">Now, do you anticipate that there would have to be structural changes if you were to prevail that would conflict with the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea?</text>

            <text syncTime="169.186" offset="676676">No, and you have put your finger on the point, and that is that there are no conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.523" offset="694021">We know that for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.313" offset="701231">The first is that there has been a detailed rule making underway in which the regulatory authorities charged by Congress with implementing the ADA have spent quite some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.047" offset="736131">They have produced this single spaced, half inch thick document that is dedicated to making--</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="191.356" stopTime="271.315">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="191.356" offset="765388">--They are not, but in terms of whether or not the statute, when it's applied, would conflict, you would look to this document and they took as their regulatory mission to make sure there were no such conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.063" offset="808229">What they did... let me take your example specifically and then put... place it within the statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.462" offset="833829">Within the ADA and a question of the combings, what they said is, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.777" offset="859011">In certain cases SOLAS requires that the coamings be a certain height.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.931" offset="875624">If the coamings are below the bulkhead level, where you would be worried about water coming in below, that is not an accessible route, and so you don't have to worry about it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.136" offset="912509">Above there, you ramp up to the coaming and ramp down, unless that's structurally infeasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.830" offset="935288">So they... what they did is they... and this is the broader point.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.514" offset="946051">they applied the rule of the ADA that a change to the structure of the vessel only has to be implemented if it's readily achievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.316" offset="977189">And what the regulatory authorities determined is that if there is any conflict with SOLAS at all, that change need not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.285" offset="1009058">Now, you... Justice O'Connor, you also focused on the fact that there are some of our claims that implicate the structure of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.024" offset="1032046">They are, however, a distinct minority, and we ought not lose sight of this because I don't think the other side has any good argument at all, under international law or anything else, that would explain why they can charge a person with a disability double.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="271.315" offset="1085231">Can you tell me just a little bit about that, how it works?</text>
            <text syncTime="274.205" offset="1096725">Suppose that you prevail in this case... and it does seem to me that the... the charging the double doesn't involve modification of the ship, obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.378" offset="1129430">How does it work if you have, oh, say, an English passenger who buys an English ticket and is charged double... I don't know if that's the English law, but let's assume... then he comes on a cruise ship and he goes to New York and Miami and... and New Orleans?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.619" offset="1194423">Can he... does he... could he then sue, if... if we rule for you in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="304.919" offset="1219605">I would think on the question of the charging double, the answer to that question would be no because it would present a traditional, not unique to the ADA, choice of law question, and that is, if you're in England and you buy a ticket in England, your ticket is going to be subject to English common... in that case, the English disability law.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.700" offset="1294733">There is an English disability law.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.897" offset="1299540">It doesn't discuss cruise ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.317" offset="1305182">It's... but it's broadly written.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.682" offset="1310720">But with respect to the structure of the ship, I think that English passenger with a disability... say that you come across to the United States and you want to get off in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.127" offset="1344470">I think that Congress clearly intended that that person would be able to come off a... off the dock in a wheelchair, back onto the dock on the wheelchair; while you were in U.S. ports and you're staying in your cabin, that you would be able to, in your accessible... your accessible rest room, have grab bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.185" offset="1408731">We are... and... and let me not pass too quickly by the fact that even when we talk about some structural changes in the ship, by and large we're talking about things that have nothing to do with... Justice O'Connor, you focused the name of the treaty is the Safety of Life at Sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.445" offset="1457737">Whether the bathroom doors swing in and out has nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.282" offset="1473097">Whether there is--</text>

            <text syncTime="368.942" offset="1475709">Mr. Goldstein, may... may I take it from your answer that it doesn't make any difference in your view, your answer to the question about the... the ship leaving from a port in England and going many places and touching base in New York, that kind of a voyage, or what this case seems to be where the vast majority of the passengers are from the United States, the port of departure is in the United States, the port of return is in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.173" offset="1608620">You don't seem to distinguish those cases because you say in the New York port, it doesn't matter if it's really a U.S. centered cruise or a cruise centered in Italy or any place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.110" offset="1660343">Is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.619" offset="13394442">--Justice Breyer, the way that those issues are worked out in the international shipping context is through the International Maritime Organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.792" offset="13427148">This organization has been responsible for crafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping codes, and it's already begun to address the issue of accessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.847" offset="13475318">We cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3382.510" offset="13529966">That's perfect because then the Government says that once it becomes a matter of binding international rule, anything that conflicts with that will be viewed as not reasonably achievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.624" offset="13570403">So all you have to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with American law, according to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.197" offset="13592764">--Well, we don't think the readily achievable language in the first case in any way contemplates conflicts with international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.453" offset="13625783">This Court has a separate canon that's almost as old as the country that it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with international obligations or international laws, including customary international law, as you wrote for the Court last term in... in the Empagran case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.057" offset="13688163">We presume that American legislatures give respect to the interests of sovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't assume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign interests of other nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.401" offset="13737587">And that's what extending the ADA to foreign flagged ships would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.775" offset="13755037">The Bahamian Government has a solemn responsibility under international law and under its own law to govern the construction and design of all flags of all ships that fly... fly its flags.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.241" offset="13804878">Article 10 of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas recognizes that flag states have responsibility for the construction and design of ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.466" offset="13833822">Article 94 of the Law of the Sea Conventions specifies that flag states have responsibility over administrative, technical, and labor matters, including construction and design matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.209" offset="13872797">These are precisely the sorts of matters that for centuries the flag state has been responsible for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.268" offset="13901009">And in the Brown v. Duchesne case, this Court recognized that, a case that dealt with the application of patent laws to the construction and design of a foreign flagged vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.101" offset="13936327">There are going to be conflicts within... between international law and the requirements of the ADA, but first of all, there's going to be confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.306" offset="13973211">It's been more than a decade since the ADA was passed, and we don't even have final regulations as to what rules apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.993" offset="13999961">And in the meantime, foreign flagged vessels are going to have to be reviewing the case law in the United States courts, determining on a vessel by vessel, design specification by design specification as to what standards apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.822" offset="14055236">That's only going to create additional international discord and confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.115" offset="14072372">Petitioners proposed solution to this problem we think is telling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.367" offset="14089404">They urge this Court in their reply brief if there is a problem after the ADA is extended to foreign flagged ships and other nations begin to follow suit and you have a crazy made... maze of different regulations applying to construction and design, then at that point, the United States can go to the IMO and ask it to clean up the mess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.572" offset="14162233">With respect, we think they have it backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.461" offset="14173832">The purpose of the IMO and the international framework that exists for governing regulation of shipping is to establish a uniform set of rules in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.460" offset="14209776">The IMO has already begun to address the problem at issue in this case, accessibility for the disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.374" offset="14229420">They are available to address that in a multilateral fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.089" offset="14244258">And Congress, in enacting the ADA, gave no indication that it weighed any of the international repercussions of the action that petitioners urges the case... petitioners urge the Court to take in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.751" offset="14298906">And we would urge this Court to return this matter to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.929" offset="14311654">Congress is in the position to weigh the risk of international confusion, to weigh the potential for international discord and to address those matters as it sees... sees fit.</text>
