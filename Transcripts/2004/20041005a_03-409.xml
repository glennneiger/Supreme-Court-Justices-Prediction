            <text syncTime="33.315" offset="133224">In the first place, if that is the case it would render the defense useless, because if there is no likelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark infringement to begin with, so why should someone try to prove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark infringement?</text>

            <text syncTime="986.599" offset="3946371">Justice Scalia, you asked for an example of a case where there might be confusion, but there would still be a fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.339" offset="3969254">This Court's decision in William Warner versus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on page 27 of our brief, gives an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.512" offset="4001959">You had Coco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.160" offset="4016588">And this Court held, as a matter of the common law fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive... fair, truthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product will be permitted even if consumer mistakes result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.858" offset="4103419">The fair-use defense that's at issue here takes its... has its roots in that common law precedent, and that common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly, Justice O'Connor, to your... and Justice Kennedy... to your questions about, what does a fairness component of this test in the statute mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.872" offset="4203416">It says the term... and I'm... and you can see, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief--</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.326" offset="12645251">We believe as a matter of strict statutory construction, that indeed it is now a vestigial provision, the fair-use defense, after the 1988 changes to the inconstestability provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.784" offset="12699063">But if the Court is not going to hold that that fair-use defense prohibits uses that are likely to confuse, we would urge the Court to adopt the Restatement position, that the totality of the circumstances, likelihood of confusion is relevant, we think factors that it's confusing in relationship to a health and safety issue would be relevant, the investment by the mark holder could be relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.998" offset="12999889">I'd also like to point out that in this particular case, the trademark is not for the word "micro color", the trademark is for the logo mark, and here's some of the confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.227" offset="13044820">The Respondents were able to obtain a trademark registration for the logo itself, and the strength in the logo itself is not being copied, we're just using the descriptive words within the logo itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.119" offset="13108454">And Congress always intended for descriptive words to be free for everybody to use in their primary descriptive sense, so long as the person, the subsequent user, is not using those descriptive words in the secondary meaning sense, and that's the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.837" offset="13175327">The confusion is only an issue to determine whether or not the elements of the fair-use defense is being met, but that confusion should be distinguished from likelihood of confusion.</text>
