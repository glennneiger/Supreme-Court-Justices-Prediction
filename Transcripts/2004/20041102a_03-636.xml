            <text syncTime="27.287" offset="109087">The unitary practice in question here was applied more than 350,000 times last year, not just to the 40,000 new prisoners entering the California system, but to all 72,000 returning parolees and hundreds of thousands of transfer prisoners such as the petitioner in this case, Garrison Johnson, a petitioner who had been housed for more than 15 years in the California prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.772" offset="223086">This unexamined, routine practice effectively erected whites only, blacks only, Hispanics only signs over the portals of the California prison system, and it is a practice which is routed in racial stereotype and the belief that all persons of a race think alike and act alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.123" offset="304483">California's needless and dangerous policy fails both the strict scrutiny test, which the Ninth Circuit should have applied, and the Turner deference standard, which the Ninth Circuit wrongly applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.973" offset="1007804">And in that circumstance, it suggests, over a 10-year study in Texas, that only 5 percent of all of the interracial... of... of all of the incidents of violence in... in the Texas prison system were what was described by Professor Trulson as having racial motivations.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.024" offset="1076036">And of that 5 percent, only one-quarter, or about 1.2 percent, were interracial circumstances where there had been interracial cellmates involved in the racial violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.110" offset="12688405">The... the hypotheticals presented by the State of California, when applied in the context of this case, demonstrate the danger of this position of segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.256" offset="12733022">The petitioner in this case is not a gang member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.145" offset="12744516">He's been in the California prison system since 1987 and before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.399" offset="12761548">When he reported to the inmate reception center at Chino in 1987, he had already three presentence reports which are reflected in... in the record of this... of this case at the joint exhibit 259.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.489" offset="12829884">He's been transferred five times since then... since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.204" offset="12844722">There's no record of his having had interracial violence ever during the time that he was in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.610" offset="12866351">And it is his view, as articulated in his deposition at page 109 of the joint appendix, that he is put into peril because he is an African American who is unable to cross race lines and unable to reach out for support in a heavily racialized setting for other persons who are not African Americans and who are not gang members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.811" offset="12959242">So he's been marginalized and treated, based upon his race, in a de jure way when he's transferred for the 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.620" offset="12986410">And incidentally, the reference to a 14-day period is not borne out by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.706" offset="13002815">The regulation in the State of California specifically provides that this organization or evaluation group has to convene within 14 days, but not have to reach a decision with regard to transfer characterization and classification in 14 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.529" offset="13062060">But... but the petitioner in this case, because he's black and has no opportunity to cell initially with a white person or a Hispanic person, is then confined to being in this small group of African Americans who are not gang members and who are unable to have an affinity group in which they will feel safe within the California prison system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.857" offset="13235409">And the danger which is created in my judgment by a reliance upon a Turner standard in this circumstance is that all that needs to be done is a little bit more of tinkering with the idea of the equivalence between race and gang which cannot exist in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.130" offset="13304477">And were that to happen, we will create a circumstance where the very arguments rejected in Lee, indeed the very argument advanced by the State of California in this case, will once again be raised time and again, and we will be faced with a circumstance not too far down the slippery slope where, for convenience or for other reasons or for purely invidious reasons, States will be able to return to an era of segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.522" offset="13414087">This Court's history has demonstrated a commitment to march the country away from the road of segregation, and there should be no turning back.</text>
