            <text syncTime="1631.216" offset="6524761">I'd like to respond to the finality concern, because I think that really goes to the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.920" offset="6551615">Three weeks ago, this Court, in Rhines versus Weber, unanimously approved of the stay-and-abeyance procedure, because the Petitioner's interest in obtaining review of his federal claims outweighed the competing interests of finality and speedy resolution of the federal petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.582" offset="6634266">Now, Mr. Felix's case is even more compelling than Rhines, because, unlike the stay-and-abeyance procedure, which is just the power... the inherent power of the Court to control its docket, here we're talking about the command of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.825" offset="6703229">In Section 2242, of the judicial code, Congress provided, specifically, that the rules governing amendments of habeas petitions be controlled by the rules governing civil procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.809" offset="6899148">And in 1948, when 2242 was adopted, Tiller was very recent; it was a 1945 case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.806" offset="6983158">And, as pointed out by the Government, habeas cases are fundamentally different, in that the notice that you give to the opposing party in tort cases, ordinary civil cases, is very vague.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.368" offset="7141460">It seems to me that those different pleading requirements suggest that what is the relevant transaction or occurrence for the one is not the same as what is the relevant transaction or occurrence for the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.293" offset="7357127">That requires some sort of facts to be plead.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.343" offset="7377293">It's also the requirement of 2243 of the Judicial Code, that the District Court review the petition so that wardens are not disturbed with every pro se litigant's Petitioner and have to respond.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.226" offset="7748859">As I read the lower-court decisions, what they've done is used the words "core operative fact".</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.855" offset="7775399">Core operative facts in a tort case, where the engine of Train A runs into the caboose of Train B, is that collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.276" offset="7817091">And the decision that the front... the locomotive should have been lit, as well as the back of the caboose, seems, arguably at least, the same operative fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.591" offset="7866305">Core operative facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.186" offset="7872679">But to say that a witness, in the middle of the trial, was treated unconstitutionally seems, at least arguably, quite a different set of core operative facts from the fact that the Defendant was questioned before the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.266" offset="7953032">Now, that seems to me related to the nature of habeas, but it still seems to me that those words, "core operative fact", the same words, work differently in the two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.116" offset="8008411">And to adopt your approach also strikes me as running around the one-year statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2764.427" offset="11057633">"Habeas Petitioner, you file, within a year, your petition with one claim, and we'll look it over. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.459" offset="11113744">But suppose you said that to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.965" offset="11123775">They passed this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.810" offset="11131193">And you say,</text>

            <label>Mr. David M. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="2808.144" offset="11232549">I think the answer to that is that statutes of limitations are ubiquitous in civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.116" offset="11264418">But just as ubiquitous is Rule 15(c) relation back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.510" offset="11281972">They go hand in glove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.371" offset="11289391">And Congress, in 1948, just three years after the Tiller case, when it enacts 2242, must have had on its mind that relation back goes along hand in glove with the statutes of limitation; and, not only that, but how relation back has been construed by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.102" offset="11364310">So I don't think it's any surprise to Congress now all of you... now all of a sudden that we say,</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.824" offset="11387193">"Oh, you know, by the way, there's this relation back that's going to give us maybe four or five months longer than the year. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.230" offset="11412898">I don't think Congress is at all surprised by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.747" offset="11422929">And Congress just adopted new rules of habeas proceedings, in 2004; didn't amend Rule 15(c), didn't provide another rule in habeas, didn't amend 2242.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.497" offset="11477891">And, as far as the potentials for abuse here, the Seventh Circuit's... Judge Easterbrook's decision for the Seventh Circuit in the Ellzey case has been on the... on the books for more than two years now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.048" offset="11548108">And I would suggest that if the parade of horribles that the Warden has suggested, about year-long delays and all of these potential abuses, in fact, are allowed by the rule that we seek here, that the Warden or the United States would have come to this Court and said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.807" offset="11627207">"Look, here are the abuses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.359" offset="11633371">"They are happening right now. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.278" offset="11641104">Well, in fact, Ellzey's been cited twice in all... in these years, by the District Court, to allow relation back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.681" offset="11670674">Mr. Felix's case has not been cited at all in a public case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.483" offset="11685930">So, I think that the parade of horribles is theoretical and not practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.932" offset="11711634">As Justice Kennedy pointed out, you have Rule 15(a) as a backstop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.086" offset="11728248">And once the answer is filed, that really cuts off any right to file an amendment as a matter of right.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="2941.607" offset="11766387">But I think that, first of all, the amendment may be made before there is a defensive plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.955" offset="11795749">As Mr. Chan pointed out, the Warden doesn't even get the petition until it's been screened by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.443" offset="11825737">The other is the understanding, on the civil side, of Rule 15(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.710" offset="11850815">It's a very liberal pleading rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.822" offset="11859278">The threshold for granting permission to amend a pleading under 15(a) is very easy to pass.</text>

            <label>Mr. David M. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="2974.864" offset="11899402">--In Foman versus Davis, this Court responded to that concern and said that District Courts have ample authority under 15(a) to deny amendments to petitions... or amendments to initial pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.530" offset="11958021">It said, for bad-faith or dilatory tactics, but then said even undue delay... so you don't even require a showing of bad faith... for prejudice to the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.155" offset="12012565">So all of the concerns that the Warden has raised are specifically identified by this Court to give the District Court the right to deny an amendment to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.764" offset="12063033">And so, I believe that those powers in the District Court are very ample, indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.495" offset="12097933">Plus, we have... the states have their own ability to protect themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.486" offset="12117891">As one of Your Honors mentioned, we have 2266.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.891" offset="12135549">If the... if the states opt in, they get the protections of 2266.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.176" offset="12156656">States have their own mechanisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.811" offset="12175151">All but six states in the Union have statutes of limitations, or very firm laches doctrines, that will prevent the elongated delays that the Warden is worried about in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.923" offset="12231680">And as far as the notice provision, Justice Breyer announced the unanimous opinion for the Court this morning, in Durachem, and said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.027" offset="12268042">"It doesn't take much to give the defendant fair notice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.541" offset="12282149">Now, I'd like to leave the Court with the judicial aphorism that wisdom often never comes at all; it should not be rejected merely for coming late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.843" offset="12327288">We ask this Court to affirm the decision of the Circuit Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.957" offset="12459781">However, as pointed out, Tiller is not a habeas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.746" offset="12478903">Rule 15(c)(2) did not even have any application to habeas cases at the time, until it was decided.</text>
