            <text syncTime="1082.341" offset="4329326">We believe the question before the Court is the proper construction of the statute, and we believe the lower courts committed three important legal errors that should be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.428" offset="4357642">The first is in drawing the clinical/preclinical distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.601" offset="4370390">And, understanding that, Justice Scalia, I think the important thing to understand is that clinical studies refer to studies conducted on humans, and at the IND stage, the whole question is to decide whether studies should be conducted on humans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.839" offset="4415321">So at that point in time the only information that's available is the preclinical studies on animals and in test tubes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.247" offset="4436950">So when the Court distinguished between preclinical and clinical, it was essentially saying, you cannot do the information that's necessary to submit an IND, necessary to do clinical trials, necessary to get your drug approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.489" offset="4473940">And that's why we... it seems to us that that's clearly wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.778" offset="4535066">The second important legal error committed by the Federal Circuit was in apparently concluding that only tests regarding the compounds ultimately submitted to FDA in an IND are subject to the protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.881" offset="4587520">Now, the problem with that is that a company can decide which specific compound to submit only by first comparing... doing studies on that compound and on others in order to determine which would be the best compound to submit, which would strike the best balance between obtaining health effects or reporting safety concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3214.717" offset="12858828">To respond to one of Justice O'Connor's earlier questions,</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.730" offset="12878890">"Does this Court have to get into a Rule 50 review. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.343" offset="12889339">the answer is no, because Merck failed to preserve its right to Rule 50 review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.802" offset="12907207">In the District Court, in the Federal Circuit, the... Merck argued the rational predicate standard as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.049" offset="12944196">That was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.291" offset="12949107">Rule 50 review, under the Intermedics standard, is an entirely different argument, and Merck never raised that argument in... before the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.105" offset="12988395">In its brief, Merck relies, on pages 50 and 51 of its brief to the Federal Circuit, saying there it argued substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.313" offset="13021205">But what it argued there was, the experiments are rational predicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.105" offset="13036356">Merck never argued, before the Federal Circuit, that the verdict can't be sustained under Rule 50, under the Intermedics standard, as opposed to the rational predicate standard, so it's not entitled to that review here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.025" offset="13256098">That issue hasn't entered into the case, so there's been no differences articulated, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.592" offset="13278354">And to get back to the point that Merck did not preserve its right to Rule 50 review under the Intermedics standard, even if it had raised that issue before the Federal Circuit, clearly the Federal Circuit didn't reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.510" offset="13329972">And if the Federal Circuit didn't reach an issue that was properly presented before it, that was error, and Merck would have had to seek relief from that error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.899" offset="13363513">And it did not do so in its petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.566" offset="13374171">So, I do not believe this Court even needs to address the issue of Rule 50 review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.243" offset="13392875">There is no dispute in this case as to the substantive standard that governs the scope of Section 271(e)(1), and Merck, having failed to preserve its rights to Rule 50 review under the Intermedics standard, there his no controversy for this Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.696" offset="13458704">If the Court does reach the issue of Rule 50 review under Intermedics, it is... the case should be decided under the basic principles that it is the exclusive province of the jury to weigh the evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.965" offset="13527771">And my time is up, but... almost... but I'll say one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.175" offset="13540624">After 25 days of trial, the District Judge, in his denial of Merck's motion for judgement as a matter of law, expressly said that the jury had reasonable cause to disregard the testimony of Merck's main witness, Dr. Cheresh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.578" offset="13602273">And, on that ground alone, the judgement with the Federal Circuit should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.085" offset="13628291">Merck can't be rescued from the jury's verdict unless this Court determines, as a matter of law, that the jury was required to believe the testimony of Dr. Cheresh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.357" offset="13669355">And Merck can't show that, and hasn't even attempted to show that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.806" offset="13747200">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.904" offset="13751589">With my two minutes, I want to make one overarching important point, and it's really in response to a question Justice Scalia asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.666" offset="13794638">The emphasis in the statute is about the use, so let's get past labels about, Is this drug discovery or basic research, or is it, as Merck says, optimization on the lead drug candidate, and look at exactly what was occurring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.541" offset="13862139">Here, this was not a,</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.274" offset="13869035">"Gee, we'd like to see what affects angiogenesis. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.626" offset="13886485">Merck knew what affected angiogenesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.314" offset="13897247">It had a structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.404" offset="13905607">And if you look at page 42 of the supplemental appendix, you will see that structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.993" offset="13927967">It knew exactly what that structure did and how it did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.174" offset="13944686">It then tweaked it by changing, literally, three atoms to compare that activity with other activity, exactly the sorts of research that any drug innovator would do to verify that they have the best and most effective candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.289" offset="14013127">Then, with... and with every single one of its experiments, it was examining information that was relevant to mechanism of action, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.488" offset="14073940">With 10 percent of the experiments, it was also running them in parallel with a series of analogs that were designed to look exactly like the RGD peptides, and to work exactly like the RGD peptides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.872" offset="14131409">And no rational drug innovator ever proceeds to clinical trials, nor does the FDA want it to, without conducting that research, because you don't spend millions of dollars for expensive toxicology studies until you know you've got the safest and most effective drug candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.875" offset="14207478">The FDA reviews that evidence, because it wants to know why you're proceeding with that candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.523" offset="14230047">And if you shift midstream to another lead, as Merck, in fact, did in this very case, the FDA wants to understand why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.475" offset="14261812">So each of those experiments, even in comparison, developed information that is relevant to the FDA.</text>
