            <text syncTime="1562.024" offset="6248072">The respondents had a full and fair opportunity to litigate every issue relevant to their Federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.676" offset="6278687">When they came to Federal court, they agreed that, with one exception, all of the relevant issues, both the ultimate issue of a reasonable relationship and all of the predicate issues that we recited, as Justice Ginsburg noted, at pages 10 and 11 of our brief, had already been litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.392" offset="6357473">They said that they... there was one difference, which is that they claimed that under the Fifth Amendment, the level of scrutiny under a substantially advances claim, which is what they were litigating, was the Nollan/Dolan test of rough proportionality, not the more deferential standard of review that the California Supreme Court applied in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.110" offset="6456424">And as to that issue, they received a full litigation and adjudication on the merits in the courts below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.067" offset="6536255">Mr. Chief Justice, here I was referring to the district court and the Ninth Circuit following the California Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.044" offset="6564153">They came to the courts and said there's one thing that's different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.657" offset="6582544">There's one element that's different, and that is Nollan and Dolan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.134" offset="6604487">Heightened scrutiny should apply to a financial exaction of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.467" offset="6621832">The California Supreme Court disagreed under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.907" offset="6643566">We want to litigate that issue here, and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.990" offset="6655896">The district court ruled against them on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.591" offset="6666344">The Ninth Circuit ruled against them on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.235" offset="6676898">They petitioned this Court in question 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.154" offset="6688601">This Court denied review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.109" offset="6696333">In all other respects, their claims... their case under their Federal claims, which were not claim-precluded, were, as the district court found, quote, based on the exact same facts and circumstances argued before the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.958" offset="6763729">Now, they... their case here boils down... and it's quite clear from their reply brief, and Mr. Utrecht has reaffirmed it... to an argument that this Court's 1963 decision in England ought to be extended to the Williamson County context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.535" offset="6838126">Now, I believe that England is distinguishable... highly distinguishable from the facts or the circumstances of a Williamson County remand for any number of reasons that I can explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.906" offset="6887549">But ultimately my point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.092" offset="6896327">England is fatal to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.338" offset="6905313">If England were extended to this circumstance, they would lose, and that is because in England, the Court was entirely clear that as to the State law issue that the Supreme Court said should be presented to the Louisiana courts first for determination, there was no doubt that issue preclusion was going to apply to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.365" offset="7001443">The question was whether or not principles of preclusion would bar them from coming back to Federal court otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.449" offset="7037701">In other words, in England, the question... there was a challenge by chiropractors to a State law that said chiropractors have to go to medical school or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.140" offset="7080542">A Federal complaint was raised under 1983, saying that violates our Fourteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.480" offset="7109904">That's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.461" offset="7113770">The Supreme Court said, well, wait a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.378" offset="7125473">We're not sure that the Louisiana law covers chiropractors, and if it doesn't, we can avoid the Federal constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.042" offset="7168104">So we're going to, in effect, certify to the Louisiana courts the question, the State law question, whether chiropractors are covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.738" offset="7262877">But in any event, no one... when... no one would have thought for a moment that having gone to litigate that State law issue in State court, if they had lost, England... the chiropractors could come back and say, okay, we think that we shouldn't have to comply with this law for two reasons: one, because we're not covered by the law even though the Louisiana courts thought so; and two, if we were, the Fourteenth Amendment would prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.491" offset="7373949">They... the question on which you granted review is limited to those issues, and there is a fair question on the record in this case whether any of those issues are really before the Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.688" offset="7426717">But as to those issues, for which Williamson County requires that a party resort first to State procedures, whether issue preclusion applies, and the... the extension of England by analogy to this would dictate the answer yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.589" offset="7494322">It may not apply if... if you extend England to all other types of issues that a party may litigate along with their Williamson County ripening exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.597" offset="7546358">But the very determination that Federal law requires them to obtain under State law, prior to stating a ripe Federal constitutional claim, of course, gets issue preclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.379" offset="8397427">It did make reference to its prior determination in Dodd v.

            <text syncTime="2120.865" offset="8483422">And in that respect... and this I think goes back to Justice O'Connor's question about, you know, what... what could we have been thinking or not thinking in Williamson County... the... the Dodd case provides a pretty good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.072" offset="8536189">At the time this Court decided Williamson County, many, probably most States did not have a substantive takings jurisprudence that was akin to the Federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.897" offset="8579553">For example, California itself, New York didn't provide compensation for regulatory takings at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.331" offset="8605257">In those States, there would be no question of either claim or issue preclusion because in the course of deciding whether or not compensation was due under State law, there would be few, if any, common issues decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.919" offset="8679654">Now, as the Ninth Circuit explained in Dodd v. Hood River, Oregon recognizes... in the context of regulatory takings, recognizes an Agins type claim, that is where you are completely denied all economic value to your... I'm sorry... a Lucas claim, but they don't recognize the Penn Central standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2248.455" offset="8993750">The California court would have denied their State claim, presumably denied their Federal claim, and... and both could have come up here I suppose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.481" offset="9073894">I think it was certainly open to them and the... the Ninth Circuit, in its first opinion, made clear that it was open to them, when they went... when they did their Williamson County ripening, to also litigate the Federal constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.615" offset="9130423">And in that instance, if they lost in the California courts, of course, they could have petitioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.045" offset="9156127">They couldn't... if they lost on the State constitution, the court would have had to reach the Federal constitutional question as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.763" offset="9179011">But I think, Justice Scalia, more to your point about what actually happened here, I think that a very good argument... I... I don't think that there's really much doubt that if they had petitioned for certiorari from the California Supreme Court decision, you could easily have granted review under Zacchini and Michigan v. Long and Ruiz because the California Supreme Court said, to be sure we are deciding only the State constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.088" offset="9292278">We are not ruling on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.359" offset="9305339">But they made very clear that, whatever congruent means... they made very clear that they looked to this Court's statements and expositions about the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to construe the claims the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.153" offset="9364584">And as this Court said in Ohio v. Reiner, I think 2 years ago, when a State court's interpretation of State law has been influenced by an accompanying interpretation of Federal law, we may review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.820" offset="9419233">And in fact, if you think about it, think of almost every takings case that you've decided since Williamson County.</text>

            <text syncTime="2386.459" offset="9545770">That was a case that was filed in the district court and litigated in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.896" offset="9563533">And it raises a real anomaly about whether or not this case even really presents the question on which you granted review because their... the theory that they have pursued in State court and at this round in Federal court is that there is a takings violation under both the State and the Federal Constitution under the so-called substantially advances prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.548" offset="9666142">Their complaints allege a Penn Central violation, but their briefs in the lower court... in the lower Federal courts in this proceeding and in the State courts don't discuss Penn Central at all, as the California Supreme Court in footnote 14 of its opinion explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.638" offset="9746495">So if this is just a substantially advances claim, it raises the question, number one, whether in the context of legislation, there is a substantially advances prong in the Fifth Amendment, a question that you're... you're asked... that you are presumably addressing in Lingle v. Chevron.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.510" offset="9826011">If there is, it raises the separate question posed by this Court's decision in Yee whether that is a claim for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.488" offset="9861851">In other words, what this Court said in Yee is when you challenge, under the Fifth Amendment, legislation on the grounds that it doesn't substantially advance a legitimate government objective, this Court said, that's not a claim for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.251" offset="9916918">That is a claim that the ordinance be struck down and not applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.197" offset="9932696">And that's what they're litigating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.530" offset="9942100">Now, they have... and so the question is if it's not a claim for compensation, is it subject to Williamson County ripening?</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.687" offset="9974700">Why should you have to go to State court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.605" offset="9982328">So there are a lot of this... the Conference of State Chief Justices have filed an amicus brief in support actually of us in this case, saying we don't see that the facts of this case present the question on which you granted review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.718" offset="10042828">I think it's fairer to say it's not clear because the petitioners did challenge this ordinance not only on its face, but as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.281" offset="10081071">And although the district court below found that it wasn't a real as-applied challenge because they couldn't in any meaningful way distinguish themselves from the other 500 residential hotels in San Francisco, all of whom are concededly subject to the hotel conversion ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.886" offset="10167484">At least I suppose in theory, there is some claim for compensation for the temporary period in which they were subject to the hotel conversion ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.491" offset="10221923">So I... I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.676" offset="10226625">I... you granted cert in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.475" offset="10233835">We'd like to get the... the question answered, but I think the reason this long disquisition, Justice Kennedy, about Del Monte Dunes is in Del Monte Dunes, it was a substantially advance claim, and I think it was thought that there was no need to engage in Williamson County ripening.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.267" offset="10601012">And therefore, any determination on that issue should not get preclusion here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.813" offset="10775197">That is, if the district... if the State court finds, you know, that the property is in such and such a place and on such and such a year, this thing happened or that the ordinance, as it applied, had this effect or that effect, there certainly would be no possible argument that issue preclusion wouldn't apply because they... those were necessary determinations and they had a full and fair opportunity to determine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.121" offset="10872477">As to the ultimate issue, this would be... the Full Faith and Credit Act directs the Federal court to ask what would the law of California say about this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.998" offset="11127954">I'm... I'm qualifying my answer a little bit because I do think that if you came to Federal court and said, look, this was a sham or they... they... their analysis was so skewed that it can't fairly be said that they were really applying the Federal standard, something like, you know, the... the AEDPA standard now that... that you get review if it's an... not just an incorrect determination, but a wholly unreasonable application of law or fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.239" offset="11660852">It was a simple, straightforward question about whether an ordinance that says if you run a residential hotel or you have residential rooms that you have certified as of the date the ordinance was enacted and you want to change them permanently to full-time tourist use, you have to bring an equivalent number of units on line or you have to pay an in lieu fee to the city's building fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.700" offset="12166792">And they then went to State court, and they pressed not only their pending municipal law question, but they also made their takings claims under Penn Central and under the substantially advance prong both as applied and both facial under the State constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.786" offset="12995082">So we take... we accept as true the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.811" offset="13011174">Plus, we take judicial notice of all the things that the parties asked us to take notice of, which are matters of public record, of which there were many, many, many in this case, including, for example, the fact that every year from 1990... well, every year from the... from 1983 on, when they took over operation of this property, they filed with the city an annual report that listed that, A, the determination that all 62 of their rooms were for residential use and then explained... and then stated out the exact number of rooms by quarter that were, in fact, used by... for long-term residences and those that, during the summer months, were used for tourist use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.106" offset="13204376">The court took judicial notice of that, as it was appropriate, en route to its decision... this is a subsidiary issue I suppose... that the conversion of this hotel to full-time tourist use would, in fact, cause a loss in the stock of available affordable housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.435" offset="13285669">That was an issue that was determined in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.303" offset="13321195">It was the application of law to fact, as this Court explained, I think in Yee, is characteristic of substantially advances claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.869" offset="13375425">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.439" offset="13381695">There's no question that Williamson County creates problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.004" offset="13396010">The Ninth Circuit in this case did not just issue a Pullman abstention order the first time we were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.251" offset="13416908">They dismissed our as-applied claims as unripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.582" offset="13430282">It dismissed our facial claim based on economic viability as unripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.028" offset="13448046">So we're squarely within the context contemplated by Williamson County; i.e., we proceeded in State court with our State compensation claim in order to ripen the Federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.956" offset="13491722">The city acknowledges, as a result of that, that there's no claim preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.682" offset="13510635">And this Court's decision in Migra says that if there's a reason not to apply claim preclusion, there should also be a reason not to apply issue preclusion, that there should be an exception for both or an exception for neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.096" offset="13560372">In this case, in addition to acknowledging an exception for claim preclusion, Mr. Waxman also acknowledged that if the State court was, as I... my notes show, so far off the reservation, the Federal court could revisit the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.294" offset="13617110">The problem, of course, with so far off the reservation is that might be a good test for this Court to adopt, but if the city's position is correct, this Court does not have that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.925" offset="13655667">This Court is stuck with whatever law the State imposes under issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.212" offset="13676774">So this Court is not free, if the city is correct, to create some special exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.447" offset="13697776">I think the only basis for finding a separate exception in this case is the one that this Court set out in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.984" offset="13723899">I see no reason that it shouldn't be extended to this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.396" offset="13737482">Unless there are any questions, I have nothing further.</text>
