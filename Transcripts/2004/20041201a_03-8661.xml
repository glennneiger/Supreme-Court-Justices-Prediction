            <text syncTime="2811.284" offset="11245087">And the other basis for drawing a distinction between appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the trial court on the other is historical tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.612" offset="11278420">I think the Court could look to history and history would show that on one hand trial courts have always had inherent authority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because the practical exigencies of trial are such that trial courts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of justice require trial courts to have the authority to revisit their mid-trial rulings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.658" offset="11378625">We would, Justice Kennedy, but it raises a distinct problem because one value that's served by the Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's interest in preventing the prosecution from honing its evidentiary case by repeated efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.796" offset="11431184">And if the trial judge were permitted to reopen the case to give the prosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.877" offset="11459500">Now, we still think that the proper line is jury discharge, but we understand that that hypothetical would present a distinct interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.588" offset="11490325">Now, with respect to historical tradition on appeals, the historical tradition is clear that the government has lacked authority at common law to take an appeal in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.597" offset="11534315">This Court relied on that common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United States and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v. the United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why the Court construes statutory grants of authority to the government to take an appeal in criminal cases quite narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.704" offset="11606727">And so I think the Court could draw a distinction between reconsiderations by the trial court and appeals by looking to historical tradition, and the Court often looks at history to shape the contours of double jeopardy protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.142" offset="11652493">And that would afford the case... the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while appeals were forbidden, in this case trial court reconsideration should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.277" offset="11693035">And I think the lens through which the Court would do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the valued interest in giving the prosecution one full and fair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while that full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal, because the Court held as much in Smalis, it doesn't exclude reconsiderations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.634" offset="11882475">Justice Souter, we think a constitutional rule that would turn on the definitiveness of a trial court ruling would be flawed in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.756" offset="11914971">First, the line between a definitive ruling and a tentative ruling is not altogether clear, and we've outlined in our brief at page 24 in a lengthy footnote a variety of factual scenarios that come from real cases where trial judges, as they often do, rendered a ruling on a motion for acquittal orally, and whether you think that ruling was definitive or tentative might depend on which page of the transcript you happen to be looking at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.853" offset="12011311">But even if we're dealing with a situation in which the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of the line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court might be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively but still be incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.336" offset="12781296">It would be equally the case, for example, as the State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling that barred the prosecution from introducing a category of evidence, but then the trial judge, later in the proceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.454" offset="12825809">The question would be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in prejudice to the defendant because the defendant had detrimentally relied on the trial judge's initial determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.349" offset="13397368">The Constitution does not bend to a judge's inherent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.937" offset="13407713">Second, the... the Government is trying to substitute a standard here of a second proceeding, which is not this Court's standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.819" offset="13443239">This Court's standard is further proceedings after an acquittal, including resumption of the same trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.738" offset="13462883">That's what this Court said in Smalis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.124" offset="13488483">That comes from cases that are mistrials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.836" offset="13495275">This is an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.748" offset="13498932">This is not a particular tribunal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.632" offset="13506456">As to the judge resolving all the issues in a bench trial and... and that's why that... that acquittal would be more final than a motion for a directed verdict, it was a motion for a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.738" offset="13558909">It was a demurrer in Smalis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.375" offset="13565492">It was the exact same standard that the judge applied in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.284" offset="13577091">As to prejudice, prejudice has never been a factor in this Court's double jeopardy analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.667" offset="13602586">As a matter of fact, in... in one of the really classical statements, Ex parte Lange, if you look at the facts of that case, that looks like complete gamesmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.638" offset="13634456">The defendant was sentenced to a jail term and a fine when the... the statute only authorized a jail term or a fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3417.338" offset="13669251">It's a get-out-of-jail-free card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.509" offset="13678028">There's complete gamesmanship, but prejudice was not a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.966" offset="13691820">And in fact, this Court has said prejudice is not open to judicial examination in double jeopardy cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.001" offset="13855974">Pretermitting the prosecution's case is a very serious matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.574" offset="13870289">You cannot take it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.756" offset="13874991">So think about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.175" offset="13884604">As to... to rule 25 itself, it's true that the... the judges can't reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.517" offset="13918041">So what they do as... as a matter of practice in Massachusetts is they simply deny, and... and they deny the first one and they have two more opportunities, one at the close of the defendant's case and they have an opportunity at the close of... after the jury has returned a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.296" offset="13985123">At each of those steps, they can make a motion for acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.014" offset="13999961">As to the full and fair opportunity, this Court said in Martin Linen that the Government has a right to try the case.</text>
