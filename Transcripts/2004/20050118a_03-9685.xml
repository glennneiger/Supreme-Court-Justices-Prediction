            <text syncTime="6.715" offset="26854">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.867" offset="47438">On occasion a prior conviction that's used to enhance a Federal sentence turns out to have been obtained in violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.179" offset="76696">This Court addressed the procedure for handling those challenges in Custis and Daniels.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.150" offset="96549">Those cases determined that, in most circumstances, the facts that would show the prior conviction is unconstitutional do not support a claim either at sentencing or under section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.750" offset="142942">This is the key phrase in this case: facts supporting the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.003" offset="156003">It's the key part of the fourth trigger in the 2255 statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.723" offset="174811">In this case, the State court vacatur is the fact supporting the claim for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.358" offset="201352">First, as expressed, Daniels made clear that the underlying facts, those facts that you use for the challenge to the prior conviction, do not support a claim under 2255, leaving the vacatur as the operative fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.491" offset="257881">Second, the plain meaning of the word fact encompasses a vacatur just like courts often refer to convictions as historical facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.638" offset="294452">And third, there's no reason to dispense with the plain language of the statute to serve policy ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.814" offset="319216">The policies animating both AEDPA and section 2255 are served by the rule advanced by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.406" offset="345548">And moreover, petitioner's rule will be a lot more straightforward in application.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.283" offset="369058">Let me--</text>

            <text syncTime="96.566" offset="386194">Under 2255, even if that applies in this situation, it does establish a 1-year statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.456" offset="493819">Now, is that a requirement that the defendant seek State relief on a timely basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="133.126" offset="532480">Can the defendant just wait indefinitely before going back to the State and seeking a vacatur?</text>

            <text syncTime="154.775" offset="618998">The first is that the petitioner's position relies on a straightforward reading of the statute, and we think that the due diligence requirement is satisfied when the vacatur is discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.642" offset="682527">Here the defendant did go back to the State courts and got this... the earlier convictions vacated.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.558" offset="986175">How... how could one not discover the vacatur?</text>
            <text syncTime="248.595" offset="994325">Here's my problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.361" offset="1001430">I... I frankly don't think the text of... of (4), part (4), really fits comfortably with either your interpretation or the Government's.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.025" offset="1056078">It says the date on which the facts supporting the claim could have been discovered through the exercise of diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.751" offset="1090978">Well, as you point out in your brief, the fact supporting the claim here is simply the elimination of the prior conviction, the vacatur of the prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.071" offset="1132251">That's the fact supporting the claim, not the facts which led to the vacatur, but it's the vacatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.159" offset="1160568">So that makes the Government's case a little uncomfortable.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.641" offset="1174465">But it seems to me you have to acknowledge that your case is pretty uncomfortable when you... when you talk about discovering the fact of the... of the vacatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.977" offset="1215843">I mean, it's a matter of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.841" offset="1227337">How does one discover a... a public record?</text>
            <text syncTime="310.132" offset="1240503">How... how could you need due diligence to discover a public record?</text>
            <text syncTime="315.321" offset="1261192">I mean, it seems to me it's... it's automatically... isn't the vacatur always served on the... on the person whose conviction is vacated?</text>
            <text syncTime="326.095" offset="1304346">Isn't it always that person who seeks the vacation?</text>
            <text syncTime="330.063" offset="1320229">So what sense does it make to talk about his discovering that particular fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="335.621" offset="1342380">It seems to me it makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.023" offset="1348023">So you're left with... with two competing interpretations, both of which have some textual problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.981" offset="1371847">I'm inclined to think you take the one that makes sense, given the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of the statute, as Justice O'Connor has suggested, is to make people bring up their claims promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.466" offset="1421793">And... and that purpose would... would be served by the Government's rule and not by yours.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.629" offset="1442482">You say unless the State has some statute of limitation, this... this Federal requirement of due diligence goes begging.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.429" offset="1469649">What's... what's your response to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="369.861" offset="1479367">You really think... especially about the discover.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.034" offset="1516042">On the language, paragraph (4), the fourth trigger, is broad language that was meant to cover a variety of circumstances, things from ineffective assistance of counsel, to Brady violations, to vacaturs.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.058" offset="1560137">I'll grant you that if Congress only intended the vacatur situation to be covered by paragraph (4), we might wonder why they chose those particular words, but we know they didn't intend this one circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.053" offset="1608202">I think the Government's position as to discover boils down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.691" offset="1622727">Because the answer to the question, when could the vacatur have been discovered through reasonable diligence, is easy, the answer must be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.072" offset="1652193">And we don't believe that to be the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.379" offset="1745502">You want us to read that phrase very broadly to include under the word facts something like a vacatur, and then it sounds to me you're being very literal and linguistic when you say that due diligence to find the facts shouldn't mean what I would take it as ordinarily meaning, that... that you have to, when you had a chance, go back and generate this fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.523" offset="3410024">The fall-back position of the Government is to say, all right, let's interpret the statute or rewrite it to say that we're going to trigger the date on when the vacatur could have been obtained, not when it could have been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.619" offset="3458403">And to do that, what they're saying is, well, let's give him a year from the time of the Federal sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.067" offset="3484212">So... or... or maybe even earlier, dating back to the time of the original conviction in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.851" offset="3503334">So they add that 1-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.670" offset="3510648">Then they say then we'll add a provision that tolls during the pendency of State habeas, and then we'll add another 1-year statute of limitations on top of that after the vacatur is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.134" offset="3552444">So we end up with... instead of the plain language, we have two 1-year statutes of limitations with a tolling provision in between, the type of tolling provision that is, by the way, in section 2244.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.812" offset="3763200">But we believe that that is a necessary consequence of the administrative decision that this Court made in Custis and Daniels to send these back to the State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.657" offset="3834567">But Custis and then followed on by Daniels made a different decision, and I think a good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.121" offset="3852434">It made the decision to wrap these challenges back to the State and that inevitably will result in delays as it works it way through the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.721" offset="3882841">The rationale for the Court's decision makes perfect sense when you apply it to this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.897" offset="3899559">One of the key concerns, it seems to me, that the Court had was that if you allow these Federal challenges that are outside the State statute of limitations, then it's very possible the State is not going to have the records necessary to defend it because they wouldn't be expected to keep records outside of their statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.321" offset="3969254">And that's simply not the case here because these challenges, under the petitioner's rule, would be within the State statutes of limitations, and as this Court recognized in Daniels, the States have a powerful interest in defending their convictions and that powerful interest, it seems to me, would lead them to preserve the records necessary to maintain their convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.942" offset="4955742">Well, he did it by mail, and under the mailbox rule, that would have been a timely motion to the extent that we are concerned with equitable tolling and... and permitting the placeholder petition of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.296" offset="5001091">But again, this... this difficulty in managing the process is familiar to the court because it... it's what happens when you have these pro se petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.659" offset="5042573">The important thing in this case, we believe, the core concern is with the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.454" offset="5077786">Because Daniels in substance said, the underlying facts to a State court vacatur do not support a claim, we believe that you have to read section 2255, paragraph (4) to say that, okay, then the operative fact is a vacatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.102" offset="5140376">And this case... it's a very real concern because without the prior convictions that were later vacated, Mr. Johnson would have a roughly 7-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.555" offset="5182171">Those prior convictions that were vacated... and we all can conclude now were unconstitutional... added 8 more years on his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.990" offset="5211951">He's serving more time on the enhancements than he was on the underlying sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.188" offset="5228669">And of course, the sentencing scheme depends on reliability of the information used for purposes of sentencing, and that's why Congress chose to enact the fourth paragraph and the statute of limitations so that there would be an opportunity to correct unreliable information when it came to light and it was discovered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.655" offset="5330547">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.759" offset="5351027">Petitioner's State court habeas corpus petition, which challenged his guilty plea on a ground available at the time of the plea, was filed nearly 9 years after the plea was entered and nearly 2 years after a subsequent Federal conviction became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.940" offset="5415706">Petitioner, nevertheless, contends that the challenge to his Federal sentence was timely under AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations because it was filed within a year of the date on which his State conviction was vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.858" offset="5467429">That interpretation, which enables a defendant to extend the limitation period for challenging his Federal conviction by delaying a challenge to his State conviction, is fundamentally at odds with the statutory text, the statutory purpose, and the overall statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.802" offset="5543184">To begin with the statutory scheme, under clause (1) of AEDPA's limitation provision, the presumptive rule is that a defendant wishing to... to collaterally challenge a Federal conviction has a year from the date on which the conviction becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.898" offset="5607549">Clauses (2), (3)... (2), (3), and (4) create exceptions to that general rule when a prisoner is unable to comply with the rule in clause (1) for reasons beyond his control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.834" offset="5655301">The fundamental flaw in petitioner's interpretation is that it would excuse compliance with the presumptive rule in clause (1) for a reason that is not beyond his control, a failure to exercise diligence in challenging his State conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.207" offset="5712771">Petitioner's interpretation is also inconsistent with the statutory purpose of the limitation provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.512" offset="5754044">We agree that (4) is applicable in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.466" offset="5765851">It's just that our position is that petitioner's interpretation of it is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.381" offset="5781420">We offer two alternative interpretations of how paragraph 6(4) would apply in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.506" offset="5809946">Before I get to them, I'd like to respond to a question that you asked when petitioner's counsel was standing up here, and that had to do with the difficulty of getting everything that needed to be done done in the space of a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.605" offset="5870341">It's critical to keep in mind that in the typical case of this type, the factual basis for the State claim is going to available at the time of the State guilty plea or trial, which in almost every case is going to be years before the Federal conviction becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.520" offset="5942021">And since the limitation provision under AEDPA runs from the latest of the four dates, in a typical case a defendant is going to have many years to seek the vacatur of a State conviction and he'll have up until a year after his Federal conviction becomes final to challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.292" offset="12009117">So we think our... either our primary or our fall-back position is preferable to petitioner's interpretation for the fundamental reason that his interpretation does not require diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.855" offset="12063347">It enables the defendant to extend the limitation period through his own actions, and we think it's simply foreign to the whole notion of statutes of limitations to say that the limitation period can be determined by actions that are within the prisoner's control.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.573" offset="12574198">I hope not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.519" offset="12582034">The Government's position boils down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.207" offset="12608784">They're advocating for the statute they want, not the statute they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.706" offset="12622785">This statute says the fact that could have been discovered with exercise of due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.631" offset="12646504">And once... as this Court... several Justices have recognized once you admit that the vacatur is a fact, the Government's entire argument unravels because what the Government would have... this Court holds... is that the facts supporting the claim is exactly what it held it couldn't be in Daniels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.847" offset="12715363">The... underlying the Government's argument is, I think, a principle that... that does not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.983" offset="12751830">It's that the State can't be trusted to handle the challenges to prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.866" offset="12775445">I think that is not only against experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.301" offset="12789133">It also cuts against this Court's decisions, in particular, about Daniels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.813" offset="12807210">It talked about the State having a strong interest in maintaining its convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.608" offset="12826331">The idea about AEDPA and finality I think is also important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.717" offset="12854857">To answer your question, Justice Stevens, no, this is not the most important case this Court has ever heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.293" offset="12881084">And I think that that ties into an important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.269" offset="12892996">To use my rough numbers, we're talking about at this point with the six States, less than 10 guys that might be in this 10-year scenario per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.963" offset="12927791">I think probably the number is more like three people per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.592" offset="12938344">And if the Brackett court, the court on the front lines down there in the district court, the First Circuit is right, we're talking about the results of the Government's rule to be that thousands of placeholder petitions will be filed so that petitioners don't lose their rights to challenge their Federal sentence based on the vacatur of their prior sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.253" offset="13012950">And when... when I think about what serves the ends of the statute and finality overall, I think that to prolong all these other cases, these thousands of cases--</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.005" offset="13056000">Why would you need the placeholder if the rule were, as Judge Black said it should be, that if you go to the State court within the 1 year after your Federal conviction becomes final, then the time that you are in the State court the statute will be tolled?</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.613" offset="13138442">If that's the rule, then you don't need any placeholder filings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.035" offset="13156101">--Two responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.307" offset="13165192">First, if that is the rule, I'm not sure I read the Eleventh Circuit to be so crisp on it that you definitely get tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.201" offset="13188702">I think it was a case-by-case determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.014" offset="13196016">And anytime you're in a soft... what I call soft equitable tolling situation where you don't know for sure, that's going to lead to placeholder petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.873" offset="13223393">Alternatively, if we're talking about a rule that's a hard equitable tolling rule, that is, there is tolling every time there's the pendency of the State petition, well, it seems to me that we are adding a provision very expressly to the statute that doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.123" offset="13280444">2244 has exactly that tolling provision, and that is not in this... in the 2255 provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.070" offset="13312209">And this Court would be adding it, and we don't think that is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.257" offset="13328927">At the end of the day, there's been a question about doesn't a tie go to the Government in this case because of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.284" offset="13353064">That is, if both interpretations are equally plausible, because of finality, doesn't it go to the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.729" offset="13374903">Of course, you've heard me contest we don't think it's a tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.252" offset="13384934">We also don't think finality cuts in the favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.831" offset="13399249">But even assuming we have a tie, we think that... that should... the tie goes to the petitioner because this statute is recognized in Clay as in derogation of common law, and statutes and derogation of common law are to be strictly construed.</text>
