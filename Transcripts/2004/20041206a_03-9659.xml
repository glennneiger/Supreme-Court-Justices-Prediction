            <text syncTime="32.811" offset="131239">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="41.782" offset="167079">In Hernandez v. New York, this Court explained that there are exceptional cases in which the totality of evidence surrounding jury selection is so strong that a finding of no discrimination is simply too incredible to be accepted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.099" offset="244297">This is that exceptional case, a case in which even on collateral review, the sheer weight of the mutually reinforcing evidence renders objectively unreasonable the State court's conclusion that race did not motivate even one of the prosecution's peremptory strikes.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.041" offset="388075">You have to find, Justice O'Connor, that race was the but-for factor or the tipping factor, not the only factor, but the but-for factor for at least one to come within the four corners of Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.897" offset="443559">Now, I could argue I think, if I needed to in this case, that the jury shuffle evidence alone, which is an unexplained, blatantly race-based means of racially excluding jurors from the venire, comes within Batson, the Batson proscription itself, or I could argue that case too.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.575" offset="686289">That is... that was never claimed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.311" offset="753162">There is... there's some... now some reasonably substantial Law Review commentary in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.949" offset="783778">I cited the Court to... to one in the Houston Law Review or the Houston Bar Review when I was here last time, and there has since been one in the St. Mary's Law Review that says this is a procedure that is used to discriminate on the basis of visual preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.999" offset="851905">And what's particularly interesting about it in this case is there was a contemporaneous objection in week 2 and week 3 and week 4 that the State was doing this based on race, and the State offered no defense at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.005" offset="924003">It offered no defense in the subsequent Batson hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.664" offset="938632">It had no explanation before the magistrate, the district judge, the Fifth Circuit, in this Court or below, and now in this Court this time it says, well, there's this other case in which the reason given was that we didn't want to embarrass the probation officer and we didn't... and we had people who had ties in the front row.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.784" offset="1031105">There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that would justify those excuses here.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.979" offset="1051899">And the evidence in the... the only evidence in the record that seems to me compels the conclusion that this was done for the deliberate purpose of minimizing the number of African Americans on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.360" offset="1105398">And it was done by prosecutors, each of whom... there were two prosecutors in this case, each of whom was found to have violated Batson in criminal... other criminal trials contemporaneous with this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.980" offset="1235905">Now, that is both factually wrong and legally irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.007" offset="1251997">They shuffled three times and they tried to shuffle a four times... a fourth time because, the Court will perhaps recall... this was discussed in the Court's last opinion... because they waived in the fourth week.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.001" offset="1355964">There... under this Court's Batson jurisprudence, the proscription against using peremptory strikes for a racial purpose or a gender-based purpose is proscribed to the defense, as well as the prosecution, but there... the one doesn't excuse the other, and there has never been a claim, nor is there a factual predicate laid in this case for a claim, that Mr. Miller-El's trial lawyers were doing the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.762" offset="1562958">--I think, if I needed to... I mean, we... we've argued that the shuffle, just like the race coding of the cards in the pre-Batson era, the disparate questioning on minimum punishment and the graphic script, all reinforce what we think the record shows with respect to each of the six peremptory strikes that we challenge--</text>
            <text syncTime="410.784" offset="1643102">But if we didn't have that, Justice Kennedy, I would be here arguing that if I could show a single strike that was made for the purpose of eliminating African Americans from being considered for jury service, that that ought to come within this Court's proscription of Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.394" offset="1721574">Now, we haven't made that freestanding claim because I don't think we need that freestanding claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.965" offset="1747801">The jury shuffle is a practice that exists only in the State of Texas and, to my understanding, has ever existed only in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.186" offset="1784686">So it's a... it's a very peculiar phenomenon, but I think I could make the argument that, look, even if there weren't any of these six... let's say they shuffled it so successfully that no African Americans came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.829" offset="1839229">There simply were no African Americans out of the 108 who were questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.432" offset="1857724">It seems to me that that in and of itself would violate at least a generous reading of Batson.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.198" offset="6572722">The majority of African Americans summoned for jury duty in this case were either opposed to the death penalty generally or unwilling to impose it, while the majority of white jurors had no qualms about the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.211" offset="6624758">Striking prospective jurors based on their case-related views which, after the fact, correlate with race is not unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.286" offset="6785045">And the record in this case actually does not support that that... does not support a proposition that black jurors were questioned differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.857" offset="6819422">Most significantly, the minimum... the questioning on the graphic script.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.438" offset="6845649">Of the six challenged jurors in this case, only two received the graphic... graphic script at the outset of their voir dire, Carrol Boggess and... and Wayman Kennedy, both of whom had answered the questions in their juror questionnaire indicating ambiguity regarding their views on the death penalty regarding their support for the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.519" offset="6934047">Now... now, as I understand it, this case was here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.527" offset="6946064">We all read this and we went through it, and as a result of that, I... if I read the opinion... not the dissent, but the majority opinion... and it might be in my interest if people followed dissents more, but I think the law is we follow the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.679" offset="7014713">So when I read the majority opinion, I read, number one, there was history in this county, at least 7 years earlier though, where they actually had a booklet which said let's keep all the African Americans out, here's how you do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.540" offset="7078139">Then you had jury shuffling, which were two instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.554" offset="7098201">In one of them, there are like 40 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.597" offset="7106351">In my mind, you know, we have rows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.970" offset="7115860">In row 1 there are four black jurors and six white; row 2, three black and seven white; row 3, two black and in the last row one black, and the prosecution says, hey, let's shuffle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.944" offset="7163716">All right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.346" offset="7169358">And the other time he did it, the only other time... it wasn't quite that bad... the same idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.661" offset="7186599">Then the third thing that comes up is you find instances here... not everyone, absolutely right... but instances where black people who seemed really for the death penalty, say, like Mr. Fields manages to get knocked off, but Mrs. Mazza who seems quite uncertain is kept on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.632" offset="7262459">And then we have this disparate questioning that you're about to mention where it just turns out that almost every black is given this really... you know, bring them in a gurney, put... put... you know, real graphic description of the death penalty, and white people who also expressed hesitation aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.907" offset="7323585">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.552" offset="7326198">So on the basis of that, the majority writes there is, indeed, a strong suspicion here that this was discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.262" offset="7369038">So I want to ask you... and if I were to write something like that... I didn't write the words, but I would mean, well, I think that's what it is unless there's something later on that comes out to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.224" offset="7408849">So I'm asking you what was to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.821" offset="12643265">But they were noting a lot of non-Batson issues too, and the one common characteristic of the Batson issues and the non-Batson issues were they were all correlated to a manual that says keep these people off the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.824" offset="12703242">And... and isn't that a sound train of reasoning that that's what they were trying to do?</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.846" offset="12879308">But even that aside, again, we must look at these six jurors and they all expressed views unfavorable to the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.675" offset="12934687">What about the Fifth Circuit said that comparing Rand's testimony... that that was in line with Mazza's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.182" offset="12968647">The Fifth Circuit seems to recognize that those two were closely comparable.</text>

            <label>Ms. Gena A. Bunn</label>
            <text syncTime="3249.104" offset="12996336">Justice Ginsburg, they recognized, as Justice Scalia had in his concurring opinion, that that was basically as close as it got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.864" offset="13027370">But at most, Mazza acknowledged that the decision whether to impose a death sentence would be difficult, not an easy one, kind of hard, but she simultaneously stated that it was a decision that she believed that she could make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.094" offset="13084317">She never questioned her ability to assess a death sentence in an appropriate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.632" offset="13102498">She merely acknowledged that it was a decision that she would not take lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.392" offset="13117544">She also had served on another criminal jury in the last couple of years, a jury which had returned a guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.283" offset="13145130">In contrast, Rand explicitly questioned his ability to assess a death sentence in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.603" offset="13170312">When asked whether he could impose the death penalty, he told prosecutors right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.336" offset="13201241">He declined to describe himself as someone who believes in the death penalty and can serve as a jury... juror and assess the death penalty if warranted, stating that he was probably in between the first two categories described by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.776" offset="13255053">Notably, Mr. Waxman referred to the prosecutors' notes on the questionnaires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.715" offset="13274802">What he didn't mention was also noted on the... by the State at... at the joint lodging, page 30, is that Juror Rand had referred to the death penalty as a touchy subject and that he had described himself as a person falling somewhere in between the two categories described by the prosecutor, the first being someone who believes in the death penalty and can assess it, the second being someone who believes in the death penalty generally but cannot personally assess it as a juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.595" offset="13390367">So the State did take note of the... of the expressions of ambivalence by Rand during his voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.896" offset="13419520">Juror Mazza, again, never expressed this level of ambivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.360" offset="13437388">These are not similarly situated jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.782" offset="13447105">And the same is true of Miller-El's attempted comparison of Rand and... and Juror Sandra Hearn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.886" offset="13467481">She expressed hesitance on assessing the death penalty in a very particular circumstance, the... a first offense, and certainly this is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.267" offset="13504993">On the other hand, Rand had questioned his ability to assess a death penalty in any case and, against Hearn's State-friendly views, led to a defense challenge that was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.163" offset="13556611">And the fact that the defense vehemently objected to her on direct appeal is further evidence that she's not similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.886" offset="13595481">Under Batson, Miller-El has the ultimate burden of proving purposeful discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.320" offset="13617215">He has failed to satisfy that burden, and the State trial judge found that prosecutors in this case did not act with a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.512" offset="13650024">As this Court acknowledged in its earlier opinion, Miller-El is not entitled to habeas relief unless he can... he can show that the State court's rejection of his Batson claim was objectively unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.059" offset="13696209">He must produce clear and convincing evidence and he has failed to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.624" offset="13722436">Mr. Waxman, you have about 3 minutes left.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.851" offset="13743334">I have just three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.934" offset="13747722">The Fifth Circuit had precisely the same record before it that this Court had and the State submitted very nearly precisely the same brief that it presented to the Fifth Circuit the time before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.568" offset="13806237">Disparate questioning on the minimum punishment ploy was objected to by the defense during the voir dire and it was acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.736" offset="13842913">If you look at the Batson argument, it's either Mr. Macaluso or Mr. Nelson said some of the jurors were questioned disparately, but... and they gave the explanation that it had to do with views on the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.171" offset="13888679">So it was before the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.283" offset="13897038">Now, on the graphic script, which is the disparate questioning that Ms. Bunn has focused the Court's attention on, the State now says, okay, we can't speculate about what we don't know about the questionnaires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.344" offset="13949283">Let's just look at the questionnaires that we do know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.971" offset="13963807">Justice Stevens, it is... you are quite right that that tells you nothing about the dozens of other white jurors whose questionnaires we don't have, but we don't need to indulge in that speculation in this case because what we know from the questionnaire answers that we have is that every black who expressed anything that could be called hesitation on their juror questionnaire, including just not filling in either question... answering question 56 or 58, got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.278" offset="14089091">Five whites who expressed hesitation did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.112" offset="14112392">That is Juror Mazza, Juror Hearn, Juror Duke, Ms. Girard, who testified that she didn't... who acknowledged in her voir dire that she hadn't filled out one of those questions which got similarly situated African American jurors the graphic script, and Juror Whaley who... or Venireman Whaley who testified that her questionnaire expressed great hesitation about the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.320" offset="14217195">And what we also know is that the three jurors who got the graphic script, Troy Woods, the black juror; Mr. Gutierrez, the Hispanic juror; and Marie Sztybel, the only Jewish juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.030" offset="14284069">If the Court has no further questions.</text>
