            <text syncTime="68.047" offset="272091">When the Sixth Circuit withdrew its judgment affirming the denial of habeas corpus relief 6 months after this Court denied certiorari review, it exceeded its authority to act under both the rules of appellate procedure and this Court's decision in Calderon v. Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.700" offset="334785">As to the rules, rule 41(d)(2)(D) requires, without exception, that the court issue a mandate immediately upon the filing of an order of this Court denying certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.266" offset="376999">That did not happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.148" offset="384522">But because the court had no discretion under the rule to do anything other than to issue that mandate, its subsequent action withdrawing its judgment was tantamount to a recall of the mandate, which, under this Court's precedent in Calderon, cannot be justified in this case because the evidence simply does not support a miscarriage of justice, which under Calderon means actual innocence of the offense or actual innocence of the death penalty.</text>
