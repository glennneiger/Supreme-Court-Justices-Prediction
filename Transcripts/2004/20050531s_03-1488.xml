            <text syncTime="7.325" offset="29257">Johnnie Cochran who is a, as you probably know, well known trial lawyer, brought a state defamation action in which he claimed that the petitioner, Ulysses Tory, picketed at his office and pursued him on the street, insulting him in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.154" offset="88607">Apparently, about money that Tory thought that Cochran owed him, but the Trial Court found that there was no such debt of any kind and that the Toryâ€™s claims lacked any foundation, and ultimately entered an injunction against Tory that among other things ordered him not to make any oral statements about Cochran or his law firm in a public place.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.832" offset="187246">Tory appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.300" offset="193097">He lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.912" offset="195605">He sought certiorari here.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.514" offset="201979">He said that the First Amendment leaves the Trial Court without the power to issue an injunction about speech in a state defamation action and in any event, the injunction he said was too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.530" offset="250044">We said we would review it, we read the briefs and after oral argument of the case, we are sad to say that Johnnie Cochran passed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.198" offset="284735">His counsel, now representing his wife, thinks that we should dismiss the case as moved but Tory has asked us instead to vacate the judgment and remand the case so the injunction which is still there cannot remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.742" offset="342936">We conclude that the case, at least, in so far as federal law is concerned is not really moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.739" offset="366864">Nonetheless circumstances have changed dramatically so that the injunction as it now stands lacks the reasons that brought it into existence in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.126" offset="404480">So, it is clearly too broad as it now stands and consequently must violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.689" offset="426736">So, for that reason and others which we set forth in an opinion, we vacate the decision of the California Appeals Court to remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.414" offset="457561">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
