            <text syncTime="52.921" offset="211592">I... I know you haven't challenged the existence of it, but I'm not sure that lets me off the hook.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.380" offset="229460">We... we had a case some years ago in which both sides apparently wanted the statute in existence and they conceded in the... in the court of appeals that the statute existed and wanted us to say what this presumptively existing statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.553" offset="298109">And we held, since there was serious doubt about whether the statute had been properly enacted, we had to reach that question first because we were not going to speculate on what a, you know, hypothetical statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.977" offset="359863">And I think you're asking us to do sort of the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.326" offset="373238">You're... if... you know, without even conceding or... the Government doesn't concede anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.920" offset="403644">You're asking us to hold that if this is covered by the Due Process Clause, what you've given here is enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.096" offset="460382">And it... it really seems to me that to say that there's a liberty interest here flies in the face of our more reasoned opinions in this area, especially Sandin which... which has some language that's... that's almost... almost right on point.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.884" offset="927451">Now, I guess to be categorized in category 5 in your State, it does involve putting someone in solitary confinement, reducing their time for exercise, and reducing their options for parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.030" offset="4200072">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.057" offset="4216163">The procedures that Ohio provides for placement into its supermax prison facility are more than ample to satisfy due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.470" offset="4253780">As the Federal Government has argued in its brief, the Bureau of Prisons believes there is no liberty interest implicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.929" offset="4279693">But even if one assumes that there is, the type of decision at issue is inherently a predictive one that turns on the holistic judgment of prison officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.705" offset="4334759">Why is it a predictive judgment that a person is a gang leader?</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.897" offset="4359523">The ultimate decision, given the facts and circumstances, we predict that this person is among the worst of the worst, but the findings that have to be made along the way are not necessarily predictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.364" offset="4429427">I mean, it... it would be nice if the... if the issues came simply divided what happened in the past, what might happen in the future, but the judgment that's made to classify someone as 5 inevitably involves some, well, what happened in the past on the basis of which we can project what might happen in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.392" offset="4521482">We would have three responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.848" offset="4527334">One is first in Ohio, as in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, in the large majority of instances, most of the facts upon which a predictive assessment would turn have already been subject to some more formal type... trial-type procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.303" offset="4581146">For example, in the Bureau of Prisons, the vast majority of prisoners who are placed in one of our two more restrictive facilities have committed some violent act in prison for which they have been found to be guilty pursuant to formal Wolff-type, trial-type procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.833" offset="4659304">Secondly, with respect to facts that might be taken into consideration for which there hasn't yet been such a formal trial-type proceeding, this Court has made clear that when you're talking about the types of predictive risk assessments that are at issue here, it is appropriate for prison officials, using their expertise and judgment and knowledge of the prison conditions in their prison and in the prison system as a whole, to take into account things that are rumor, innuendo, and other imponderables that may not have been proven in any fact-type proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.049" offset="4888137">But again, I believe that most of the... the facts upon which these decisions are based and... and Ohio asserts in its brief that that's the case in their case too, that people who are placed in level 5 have either been subject of a rule board's infraction hearing or have committed a crime for which they've been convicted while in prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.840" offset="4991269">But even so, the consideration at issue takes into a broader spectrum of consideration than just the individual inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.801" offset="5027109">Having the type of formal fact-finding retrospective proceeding that the court below required here is going to focus the decision-maker in the wrong direction and on a more narrow set of facts than ideally we want the prison administrators to focus upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.006" offset="5087922">We want them to be looking at, just like in Hewitt, the relationship of this inmate to other inmates, of inmates within the prison generally, of inmates to this inmate, and the safety of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.624" offset="5130449">So there's more of them at stake.</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Petro</label>
            <text syncTime="3422.448" offset="13689731">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.537" offset="13694119">It has been pointed out that... that inmates stay in the prison for many years, but in reality, over 600 inmates since the opening of... of Ohio State penitentiary in 1998... over 600 inmates have gone into level 5 and over 550 inmates have left level 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.557" offset="13758171">And so the classification process is an ongoing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.358" offset="13769352">It is now established under an order of the district court, but we submit, Your Honors, that the new policy that was presented in 2002 at the time this case was pending trial, was a policy that provided a process which was the best type of process for a predictive decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.531" offset="13838106">This Court has often deferred to the decision-making of... of prison officials in seeking to protect the safety and security of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.379" offset="13865482">And in this instance, the policy that was put in place and the hearing process, without actually having essentially a fact-finding process, which is what the court has imposed on this process, was the kind of process that allows for prison officials to review a whole variety of additional information even beyond what might be evidentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.867" offset="13951373">When we think about the conditions in the prison where the inmate is currently housed, if they're at the Lucasville penitentiary in level 4... and the conditions there are particularly volatile... the prison officials need to have the flexibility to make a decision on placement in level 5 not only to protect this inmate but to protect the institution itself and the safety of the inmates and the safety, of course, of... of the personnel that work at the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.424" offset="14053669">In the Mathews test, which was applied both by the district court and by the court of appeals, there is clearly an acknowledgement that the interest of the government is very strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.605" offset="14094420">But in the second step of the Mathews test, there's a recognition that additional procedures really add no value to the decision-making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.024" offset="14132036">Here the... the government needs to have the capacity and the... the ability to make the best possible decision looking at a whole variety of factors, and to have a procedure put in place by the court that requires a full display of all the evidence that will be presented at the time of hearing, as incorporated in the notice to the inmate that a hearing will be held, and then an acknowledge that there's... only this evidence is the evidence that... that is being relied upon really presents essentially a fact-finding hearing where the hearing process that is set forth in New Policy 111-07 is more than just fact-finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.770" offset="14286994">It's kind of an analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.964" offset="14291801">It gets an opportunity... provides an opportunity to really assess the attitude of the inmate, the... the risks that are involved in... in placement in a... in a different level in a different penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.651" offset="14342583">It is directed at protecting the safety and the security of the inmates and, obviously, of protecting the... the safety of the personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.144" offset="14380513">And it is fully consistent with this Court's precedents.</text>
