            <text syncTime="70.874" offset="283481">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.868" offset="299468">The issue in this case is whether Congress expressly provided for a limitations period for a retaliatory discharge action under the Federal False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.194" offset="340741">The 6-year limitation period set out in section 3731(b) of the act is tied to a violation of section 3729, that is, the submission of a fraudulent claim to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.002" offset="395912">The triggering event to start the statute of limitations running under section 3731(b) is a violation of section 3729.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.322" offset="437185">Because a violation of section 3729 is not an element of the cause of action for retaliatory discharge, Congress did not intend to provide a limitations period in section 3731(b) for a retaliatory discharge action.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.253" offset="508970">The Government in its amicus brief argues that Congress must have intended a uniform limitation period so that all three actions created by the False Claims Act could be brought in the same proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.940" offset="567693">The... the Government's argument undermines the very purpose of the Federal False Claims Act and the retaliatory discharge provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.042" offset="600085">The retaliatory discharge provision, section 3730(h) of the False Claims Act, not only protects people who blow the whistle, the initial whistleblower, but it expressly protects people who testify at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.991" offset="667899">And we have seen time and again in many of these cases the Government will keep a case under seal for 5, 6, 7 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.538" offset="706142">We've seen repeatedly situations, because of the complexity of the underlying violation of the false claim, that it might take a decade from when the complaint is filed to when the case actually is put before a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.219" offset="988787">But it is a very real and concrete problem when you have cases that go to trial, that it takes so long to go to trial, and those people who are testifying at trial have no protection because it' s more than 6 years from the violation of section 3729.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.088" offset="7492336">And if it's going to take... you've just said how difficult it may be to prepare one of these qui tam cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.763" offset="7702988">That's their number one concern here and to incentivize that whistleblower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.171" offset="7716676">If it so happens that the whistleblower takes much... takes a long time to prepare his qui tam and brings his... his retaliation action at the same time and ends up getting some more damages, I... I think that ranks low on the list of Congress'priorities in drafting this retaliation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.154" offset="7780519">It's the... getting the Government's money back, giving the whistleblower protection and an incentive to bring that qui tam claim is really Congress'core concern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.402" offset="7817509">And I think these other issues about damages mounting can be readily addressed with the mitigation defense and... and dealing with that that will take care of double damages so... so if the whistleblower is just sitting around waiting for that, then the mitigation defense would take care of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.922" offset="7887621">Also, I think the petitioner raised the idea that this is some kind of... the... the retaliator can bring some kind of nebulous fraud allegation if it doesn't... isn't really tied to a specific false claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.679" offset="7954704">I think that the courts are not interpreting it that way because this is a False Claims Act retaliation claim, not just a generalized fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.759" offset="7994932">So in a typical case, there will be a claim that... that the whistleblower will... will be able to point to and say I think that this claim is false.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.638" offset="8078524">I think this Court should uphold the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.372" offset="8093466">While the limitations trigger is unusual, it is the one that Congress set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.998" offset="8115931">It makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.460" offset="8121783">It reflects the unique considerations of encouraging... the goal of encouraging a whistleblower to bring his qui tam claim with his retaliation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.590" offset="8158354">19 years of experience have shown that the plain language works in the typical cases that arise, and that none of the reasons given by the petitioners come close to providing a justification for this Court to discard the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.224" offset="8216869">None of the reasons... this statute does not rise to the level of absurdity that would justify this Court disregarding the plain language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.770" offset="11770984">The Government argues that there will be problems that will arise from splitting the qui tam action and the retaliatory discharge action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.195" offset="11808705">And one of the examples that the Government use... uses is the public disclosure doctrine which is set out in section 3730(e)(4)(A) of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.832" offset="11855308">The public disclosure doctrine, however, is a red herring here because the public disclosure doctrine is designed to keep... to avoid parasitic lawsuits where information is in the... the public domain, somebody taking that information, and then filing a... a qui tam lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.971" offset="11927824">The... the public disclosure doctrine, 3730(e)(4)(A), also provides that when someone is the original source of the information, even if the basis for the lawsuit has been made public through a congressional hearing or elsewhere, that person can still bring an action if they're an original source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.482" offset="12025835">So it's a complete red herring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.056" offset="12032209">The other red herring that was put forth is a statement that there's a rule in the Eleventh Circuit relating to claims splitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.114" offset="12064392">And forgive me, I cannot recall the name of the case that the Government is referring to, but it is a decision by James C. Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.348" offset="12089365">And that specific case involved a situation where the qui tam action was brought, a settlement was reached, and then well after the fact, the plaintiff said, oh, and I have this retaliation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.908" offset="12147566">It makes perfect sense in that situation to... to apply principles of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.658" offset="12170553">What the Government is ignoring is there are no reported decisions anywhere a retaliatory discharge action was brought and then res judicata was used to bar the qui tam action filed at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.314" offset="12229172">And there's a perfectly logical reason for that because they are different causes of action, and they involve different parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.901" offset="12255504">A retaliation claim is personal to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.127" offset="12268460">A qui tam action is an action brought on behalf of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.058" offset="12284134">One final point that I'd like to make is the respondent takes the position that the False Claims Act is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.269" offset="12329064">Well, it's not unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.199" offset="12336692">It's not unique in that when you look at the Major Fraud Act, there is a retaliatory discharge provision that is virtually identical to the False Claims Act, and in the Major Frauds Act... with respect to the Major Fraud Act, Congress made a... a conscious decision not to include an express limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.684" offset="12418717">It's not... the False Claim Act is also not unique when you compare it to ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.880" offset="12539507">There... there... in the Major Fraud Act, there is a specific limitations period of 7 years in which the prosecution has to be brought by the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.071" offset="12580258">But... but there is... it... but the criminal statute provides for a civil remedy for a retaliatory discharge, and with respect to that retaliatory discharge provision in the Major Fraud Act, there is no limitations provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.816" offset="12631249">One other point that I want to make is that the False Claims Act is not... not unique when you compare it to ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.233" offset="12664895">ERISA is a statute that has essentially a retaliatory discharge provision as well in section 510 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1140.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.035" offset="12712124">And courts... the Federal courts have consistently held that there is no express limitations period for section 510, so we have to look to the limitations period under the most closely analogous State law cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.484" offset="12777848">On the other hand, ERISA has numerous provisions, numerous other aspects of the statute, that do have a limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.350" offset="12817345">The limitations period for an action for breach of fiduciary duty is a 6-year period with a 3-year tolling provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.890" offset="12855484">So ERISA is a prime example of a statute where Congress has made a decision that when you have a retaliatory discharge provision, not to apply the statute of limitations period, that you look to State law, even though that Federal statute in other aspects has other limitations provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.570" offset="12934269">If there are no further questions, we would rely upon our briefs.</text>
