            <text syncTime="345.441" offset="1381669">And as this Court has held in Craig versus Boren, and elsewhere, by enacting the Twenty-First Amendment, Congress clearly intended to incorporate both the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and to restore to the states the police power that they had before prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.349" offset="1465365">Emphatically, discrimination was not a part of that police power.</text>
