            <text syncTime="14.091" offset="56320">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.329" offset="65306">The injunction in this case violates the most basic principles of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.408" offset="85577">It's a prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.120" offset="92473">It's a content-based restriction on speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.210" offset="104803">It's vastly overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.337" offset="113267">It even restricts the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as Petitioner Ruth Craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.812" offset="135210">The injunction in this case is inconsistent with this country's unique and profound commitment that speech by public officials and public figures be open, robust, and uninhibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.907" offset="183589">One way in which the injunction is clearly unconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.185" offset="212637">For example, Ruth Craft is expressly restrained from ever speaking again about Johnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.761" offset="250984">And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.992" offset="475951">The question presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.727" offset="490893">One of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.229" offset="516911">All of the statements that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.149" offset="556513">And so it's our position that the injunction itself is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.683" offset="630700">It's our position, though, that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.337" offset="721293">Our position, though, is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.470" offset="745848">And one of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.186" offset="856712">We believe also and separately the injunction is unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public officials and public figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.798" offset="899135">But it's also our position that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.257" offset="2128980">It was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.427" offset="2485708">I would suggest three different ways in which you could write the opinion that distinguished the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.880" offset="2507442">The first is that this injunction is vastly overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.054" offset="2580167">A second way of distinguishing is that defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not permitted in defamation actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.434" offset="2633665">That's quite different than a harassment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.694" offset="2642756">And third, as I've argued, what makes this different is the basis for this injunction is speech protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.836" offset="2671282">With regard to the findings that you referred to, you mentioned two.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.309" offset="2685179">The first is invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.454" offset="2693747">Your Honor, the only privacy claim in this case was false light invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.957" offset="2711824">California law is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.447" offset="2717780">When there is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when it's based on the same fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.373" offset="12301479">But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr. Tory other channels of communication other than the public forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.157" offset="12388624">He... and... and this is... one point that I want to stress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.176" offset="12456647">We are not concerned about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.504" offset="12461976">We do not believe that those events will occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.156" offset="12476604">We did not seek to protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.611" offset="12482351">So we have given Mr. Tory an unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in the public forum because of your continuing course of repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year, over 150 times, 4 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.020" offset="12556016">And with that, I would submit that while the injunction is broad, I don't believe it's a unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this Court believes it is overbroad, I believe striking subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the speech and conduct in issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.046" offset="12708153">Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about how an opinion might be written, and there are three different ways not mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.634" offset="12734485">One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad for all the reasons that have been identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.805" offset="12755174">Mr. Cole said a couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.472" offset="12761861">One, he said that Mr. Tory can go to court and ask for modification of the injunction, but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr. Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.516" offset="12801985">Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go before the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.595" offset="12818286">However, under California law, under Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.076" offset="12840229">A second way the opinion could be written is that this for speech protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.526" offset="12862067">Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether that's in the scope of the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.676" offset="12878681">Well, it is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.344" offset="12893309">Because it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.352" offset="12925388">Yes, but you're asking us now to... the... the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.993" offset="12959869">It was mere opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.541" offset="12966139">I really don't see how that's included in the question presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.503" offset="12981917">I think it is because it goes to the question whether the injunction is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.101" offset="12996336">But I go on to the third way that the opinion could be written, and that's that injunctions are not permissible as a remedy in a defamation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.818" offset="13023190">We agree that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can have an injunction as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.169" offset="13044611">We agree if the cause of action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.929" offset="13059657">But those have specific elements that have to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.050" offset="13072196">Those elements weren't met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.180" offset="13084630">History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow injunction in a defamation case.</text>
