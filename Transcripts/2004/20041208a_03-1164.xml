            <text syncTime="3428.345" offset="13713345">Mr. Tribe has conceded that if this program were financed by a system of excise taxes that went into the general Treasury, and Congress then paid... provided the exact same amount of money to produce the exact same ads, that there would be no constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.647" offset="13778547">And, in our view, the First Amendment simply does not regulate the details of government fundraising, the details of government accounting, and the details of government bookkeeping in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.295" offset="13821179">The First Amendment is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.760" offset="13827030">But that goes back to Frothingham and Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon, and United States versus Butler, where we could trace the amount.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3465.096" offset="13860362">--Right, and the Court... the Court superceded those decisions in cases like Carmichael Coal and Storaasli Company and cases like that, where the Court said excise taxes can be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.701" offset="13910727">As long as there is a public welfare justification, they can be spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.207" offset="13936744">And it would be an odd result to have the First Amendment drive the way the government arranges a system like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.966" offset="13963807">After all... and Professor Tribe said it would be different if the cattlemen's Beef Board were gotten rid of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.465" offset="13981780">It actually... the principal point here is the Secretary controls the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.966" offset="13999856">Whatever the cattlemen's Beef Board does... and that is a government entity... the Secretary controls the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.905" offset="14019605">So that... this is not some jury-rigged system; this is a system of governmental control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.385" offset="14037473">Congress has prescribed the message, and the Secretary carries it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.226" offset="14060878">It's important to recall that many federal excise taxes go into dedicated trust funds... for highways, for other functions like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.181" offset="14096718">And out of that dedicated trust fund, there may be money expended on highway safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.676" offset="14114691">So the fact that it's dedicated really should not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.184" offset="14128692">And this case is completely different from cases like Keller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.527" offset="14142067">In Keller, the state bar was not appointed by the... by the government, there was no governmental supervision of what it did, and the government certainly did not approve the messages in favor of nuclear freezes, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.885" offset="14191491">This is different in all the critical ways that make this a program of government speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.141" offset="14212493">And, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to strike down this program would have drastic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.135" offset="14236526">There are many, many agricultural promotion programs like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.046" offset="14252095">There are 13 at the national level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.712" offset="14258782">This program has been in existence since 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.805" offset="14271216">One billion dollars has been collected, and promotions have been conducted under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.926" offset="14287621">These promotional programs go back to the '50s, and even... and even earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.997" offset="14303922">And there are many programs on the state levels, as the amicus brief filed by the states in this case shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.475" offset="14325864">This Court would be striking down a lot to hold that this commonsense way of approaching things is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.205" offset="14352718">It's also important to recognize that the ultimate beneficiary of the advertising is the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.845" offset="14371318">Yes, it affects the industry, but it's the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.024" offset="14384065">And the very first finding that Congress made in the Beef Act is, beef and beef products are basic foods that are a valuable part of the human diet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.785" offset="14415099">When the... when the... because of the collective-action problem in this industry, that it cannot organize to advertise, that basic message is not getting to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.765" offset="14455014">So this... the justifications for this, to the extent one thinks of it in terms of the commercial speech, it is squarely within the ultimate purposes of the commerce speech doctrine, which is to correctly market failure with respect to advertising in order to get information to consumers.</text>
