            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the judgment of the Court to announce in Pace versus DiGuglielmo.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.409" offset="25600">The Antiterrorism and the Effective Death Penalty Act establishes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a Federal habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.707" offset="78785">But it tolled the limitation period while a properly filed application for state conviction relief is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.334" offset="121313">Petitioner John Pace filed his federal habeas petition outside the one-year limit but argued that he was entitled to a statutory and equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.280" offset="177110">We now affirm the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit’s rejection of petitioner’s contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.611" offset="210442">Petitioner’s untimely state of postconviction petition was not properly filed and therefore did not toll the limitation period, and petitioner was not entitled to equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.338" offset="269270">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.878" offset="283481">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer have joined.</text>
