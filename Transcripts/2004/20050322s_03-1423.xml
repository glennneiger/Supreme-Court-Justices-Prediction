            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No.03-1423, Muehler against Mena.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.588" offset="38348">During a search of the premises occupied by respondent, she was detained and handcuffs and questioned about her immigration status.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.908" offset="87562">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the use of handcuffs and the questioning violated the Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.169" offset="132598">We granted certiorari and now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.054" offset="148167">First, Mena's disambient was plainly permissible under our opinion in Michigan against Summers, and the use of handcuffs to effectuate the detention was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.535" offset="210129">Second, the officerâ€™s questioning of Mena did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it was not an independent seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.719" offset="246805">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.745" offset="286929">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Stevens filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer join.</text>
