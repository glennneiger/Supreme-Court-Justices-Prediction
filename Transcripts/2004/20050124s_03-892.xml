            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have an opinion to announce in two consolidated cases in numbers 03-892 and 03-907, Commission of Internal Revenue versus Banks, Commissioner of Internal Revenue versus Banaitis.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.506" offset="77949">They are authored by Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.177" offset="108669">These consolidated cases require us to interpret the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.587" offset="130299">The respondent taxpayers were plaintiffs and civil suits where the sums recovered must be treated as income.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.059" offset="160183">Part of each plaintiff’s recovery was paid to his attorney pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.261" offset="184947">The question is whether for purposes of determining the taxpayer’s gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.688" offset="206681">The whole amount of the recovery must be deemed income to the taxpayer or on the other hand whether the moneys paid to the attorneys are excluded from the taxpayer’s gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.683" offset="254642">The resolution of this question is important because for the years in question the alternative minimum tax prevented the taxpayer’s from deducting their legal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.526" offset="302080">The government maintains that under Settle Tax Principles the whole of the litigation recovery including the portion paid to the attorney must be counted as income to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.555" offset="354220">In an opinion to the Court filed today written by Justice Kennedy, we agree with the position of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.219" offset="384836">We have long held that the taxpayer cannot exclude an economic gain from gross income by assigning the gain in advance to another party even if the taxpayer does not actually received the income, the incomes is attributed to the taxpayer if he or she retains dominion over the income generating asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.722" offset="470831">In the case of a litigation recovery, the income generating asset is the cause of action that derives from the plaintiff’s legal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.832" offset="507298">The plaintiff retains dominion over this asset throughout the litigation, although the attorney contributes a skill and effort to their recovery, the attorney-client relationship remains a principal agent relationship not a business partnership or joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.672" offset="586606">The client retains ultimate control over critical decisions such as to whether to settle the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.886" offset="615445">Even where the attorney exercises independent judgment on tactical decisions, the attorney remains an agent who is duty-bound to act for the exclusive benefit of the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.099" offset="664346">The fact that the attorney is the client’s agent means it is appropriate to treat the full amount of any recovery as income to the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.869" offset="699455">The rule applies whether or not the contingent fee contract or State law confers any special rights or protections on the attorney so long as those protections do not alter the fundamental principal agent character of the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.749" offset="766955">The judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth and the Ninth Circuits are reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.162" offset="792555">The cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.867" offset="811468">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.596" offset="818364">The Chief Justice did not participate in the decision of these cases.</text>
