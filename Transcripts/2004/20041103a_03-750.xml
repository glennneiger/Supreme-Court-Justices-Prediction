            <text syncTime="6.870" offset="27376">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.517" offset="45976">This case presents the issue of whether, when deciding the meaning of a statute, we will focus, as the Government suggests, on two words only, any court, or whether we will look at the statute as a whole, whether we will consider the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme and decide the meaning of the statute by appreciating how sections relate to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.266" offset="152973">In this particular case, 922(g)(1) of 18 U.S. Code is a... represents a merger of two old sections, title IV and title VII, that were passed in 1968 in the Omnibus Crime Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.120" offset="216398">In... in those... in that statute, we had two redundant and overlapping sections, and one talked about prohibiting persons who have been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.411" offset="269584">One, title VII, talked about prohibiting persons convicted in any court of the United States or a State of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.675" offset="298632">There were different penalties, slightly different classes of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.641" offset="314514">Title IV focused more on the receiver; title VII more on the possessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.403" offset="333531">But nothing... nothing about the... these two titles, about the legislative history suggests that Congress at any time meant something different from the term, any court, in title IV and any court of the United States in title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.157" offset="396539">And when these two were merged in 1986 in the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, again, nothing suggests, nothing in the comments, nothing in the statute, that these two terms... that the elimination of the language, any court of the United States, was--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="115.171" offset="460591">Well, I guess we have held, though, several times that Congress meant to define very broadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm statutes.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="131.646" offset="526524">So it makes it a tougher case when you use the word any because we've given the... the word any generally a broad definition.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_boas" startTime="141.844" stopTime="301.058">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Boas</label>
            <text syncTime="141.844" offset="567275">--Well, earlier this year in the Nixon case, this Court said that when we look at any... and that was a case dealing with the meaning of any entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.593" offset="602279">Did it mean any entity, public or private, or any private entity?</text>
            <text syncTime="156.371" offset="625476">The Court said any can and does mean different things depending upon the setting, and the Court said when using it broadly would lead to strange and indeterminate results, we'll give it a more narrow reading, which the Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.096" offset="680333">Now, you're right, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.620" offset="686393">This Court has said that the purpose of the felon in possession statute was to be broad and sweeping, but the Government reiterates that view, citing repeatedly three cases, Scarborough, Bass, and Lewis, and all three of those cases in which the Court referred to Congress' comments and this Court's own comments about the broad sweep of the statute were 1202(a) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.693" offset="790674">And so notwithstanding the fact that the Court said this is a broad statute, each one of those cases, Lewis, Bass, and Scarborough, were cases where by definition the prohibition was against persons convicted in any court of the United States or a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.835" offset="855249">So that language doesn't help the Government at all because those were 1202(a) cases which limited specifically the Court to any court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.268" offset="901016">So to take the... and I... and... the simplistic view that as the... as the Fourth and Sixth Circuit did and as the Government does here, that any means any, without regard to the rest of the statute, is simply... is... is too narrow a focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.557" offset="974158">Let's look at the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.959" offset="979801">It's true that the word... the term, the two words, any court, is not defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.873" offset="999445">But if we look in the definitions section, the term, crime punishable by more than a year, is defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.120" offset="1024418">And so what we should really be focusing on is the phrase, convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.163" offset="1052630">And that definition says the term, crime punishable by more than a year, excludes any State or Federal antitrust or business regulatory offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.136" offset="1100487">Now, if we exclude from the definition of crime punishable by more than a year and the Government's... if we exclude from that any State or Federal antitrust law and the Government's interpretation is adopted, then we're left with the anomalous result that if a person is convicted of an antitrust offense in this country, they're allowed to possess a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.920" offset="1191602">If they're convicted of one in France or England, they can't.</text>
