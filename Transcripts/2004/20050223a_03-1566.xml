            <text syncTime="1985.416" offset="7941642">And again, I think it's instructive to see what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.676" offset="7954704">When those laws were enacted, the United States reacted to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.557" offset="7970168">Westlands brought a suit under the APA challenging the interpretation of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.099" offset="7988349">Westlands was entitled to do that under the APA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.595" offset="8114364">Westlands could sue the United States in Claims Court for a breach of the contract, but the contract itself says that any damages that are... that the sole liability of the United States in these circumstances would be an adjustment of the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.251" offset="8172983">In other words, there are not consequential damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.397" offset="8181551">Rather, if we do not provide Westlands with the water that Westlands believes it's entitled to, then we stand liable for an adjustment in the payments that Westlands would make to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.178" offset="8220630">The suit that is being brought here is asking for consequential damages, and we believe that the contract here does not allow consequential damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.177" offset="8256679">That, of course, is a merits question that there's no need for the Court to reach, but that is the way it would be resolved in Claims Court in... in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.289" offset="8281130">I'd like to also raise the question of property rights since that has... has come up, that one of the arguments that has been made by Westlands is that they're entitled to status of a third party beneficiary because they claim they have water rights in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.395" offset="8349571">The fact is that the United States, the State of California, and Westlands, as well as the California Water Resources Board and the first tier of California courts, have all concluded they do not have the... the water rights that they claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.843" offset="8399308">But in any event, our view is that that issue is irrelevant to the inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.641" offset="8414563">Rather, the question of third party beneficiary status turns on the intent of the contracting parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.333" offset="8457300">Here there's not a shred of evidence that that was an intent... there was an intent to create enforceable rights in that third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.898" offset="8543504">Quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.044" offset="8492095">The only reference of third parties, the farmers, in the contract here is directed to limitations on what the district can do once it receives its water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.720" offset="8530860">It doesn't create rights in them... the individual farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.095" offset="8548310">What it does it restricts the ability of the district in order to protect the United States' interests, to make sure the United States will be paid for the water that it ultimately provides to the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.572" offset="8586240">The central point that I would like to leave you with, though, here at the end is the importance of protecting the relationship between the United States and Westlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.429" offset="8629708">But although we disagree on some matters, we are able to reach accommodation and agreement, and when we're able to do that, it's to the good of all concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.942" offset="8659696">The contracts and the laws here are structured to allow those types of agreements to be reached, and we think that allowing third party beneficiary suits would be very disruptive of that... that operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.983" offset="8819879">First, allowing a direct right of action by petitioners is not practical or consistent with the district's need and ability to function as a governmental entity and to allocate all of the water that it receives under contract to all of the landowners within the... the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.642" offset="8894485">This is a scarce and valuable resource, and these types of third party lawsuits jeopardize the district's ability to be able to provide water pursuant to California Water Code provisions to all of the landowners within the district.</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.399" offset="9033561">You know, and unfortunately, the... the history of this contract and these... these issues has been anything other than the district avoiding litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.878" offset="9079432">The... the whole concept of a water district is not to individualize or incrementalize the water and interests in water in any one group of landowners or any one landowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.176" offset="9128647">The idea is that the rights of all of the landowners to all of the water under the contract are to be treated as a whole and allow the district to provide protection to all of the landowners within the district as a whole, the point there being that the water doesn't belong to any one landowner or a group of landowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.665" offset="9222583">It belongs to the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.690" offset="9230733">And in fact, the way the district operates, the way it has to operate is in the context of the whole.</text>
