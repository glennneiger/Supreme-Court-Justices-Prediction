            <text syncTime="46.894" offset="187559">Under the decision below, title IX stands alone as the only major civil rights statute that would permit retaliation against those who complain that the law is being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.700" offset="234789">There are at least a half a dozen anti-discrimination laws that do not contain a separate retaliation provision, and every one of them has been found to prohibit retaliation as one kind of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.960" offset="283794">There's a reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.408" offset="289541">Anti-discrimination laws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliation are allowed to chill those who would seek to bring their institutions into compliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.989" offset="527882">In this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.898" offset="567589">The first is that there is a cause of action to enforce title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.340" offset="585352">That's Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through... your opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law and, the second point, that the statute itself is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.517" offset="634044">Title IX is violated by retaliatory action against Coach Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.038" offset="660062">He's... and... and this is an important part of title IX because, particularly here, people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because students are often minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.697" offset="698723">They're not in the best position to know the budgets.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.277" offset="709068">It is people like Coach Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is recognized about the... about the cause of action for retaliation is that it is very important to enable people to bring their institutions into compliance without resorting to litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.269" offset="792973">If I were... if I were a coach, one of the first things... especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not... not getting enough facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.272" offset="845009">This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether... whether I'm a lousy coach or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.983" offset="1023896">In some cases, there would be a textual problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.994" offset="1035912">Title VII, for example, speaks of discrimination based on such individual's race or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.524" offset="1066005">Title... and... and therefore, it might need a specific retaliation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.048" offset="1084186">Title IX speaks upon... about discrimination on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.962" offset="1103830">And here I think to... to allay your concern about the coach, we have had... title IX's retaliation provision has been the established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.941" offset="1147716">It was the law at the time Congress... it was understood, at the time Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of title VI had been construed by the administrative agency to include a cause of action for retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.833" offset="1211246">Congress enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan decision, which had recognized that discrimination can include retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.089" offset="1244264">So that it comes as no surprise that every court of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that there's retaliation under title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.634" offset="1278433">In over 30 years, there... at most we can find 140 reported cases in the Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and... in... in dealing with retaliation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.320" offset="1377280">Now, here, what the respondent did is they discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for girls.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.977" offset="1399850">When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so, because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was discriminating on the basis of sex.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.372" offset="1553450">First of all, the... the court of appeals correctly says... in the petition appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.141" offset="1616562">But for the discrimination on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and he not... had he not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't have lost his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.256" offset="1656999">He is denied the benefit of coaching in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.145" offset="1668493">He's denied the ability to participate in this federally funded program as a coach, and he is discriminated against by being singled out for retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.030" offset="1700049">And this is not a case in which... that has concern... I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question about this being a funding case, and I understand the special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that are based upon spending requirements where you want to be sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when they accept the Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.040" offset="1784059">This is not a case in which it could not have been anticipated when those funds were accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.182" offset="1812689">At that time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex discrimination was itself, of course, universally known.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.925" offset="1851664">Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.914" offset="1863576">We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education and--</text>

            <text syncTime="469.608" offset="1878413">But... but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.087" offset="1932330">And was it... Virginia Bankshares and so forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause of actions anymore.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.707" offset="2114769">And moreover, this Court has recently as the Davis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven case has found that employment discrimination, sexual harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that Cannon v. the City of... v. the University of Chicago creates that cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.228" offset="2212885">Now, this case is actually a lot easier than Davis, even taking into account the concerns that... that you and other Justices expressed there, because this is not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for the acts of third parties like students over whom you may have limited control.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.020" offset="11463993">34 C.F.R. 106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.439" offset="12105665">Justice Ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.217" offset="12164807">Another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.584" offset="12186331">That, obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.068" offset="12620173">I had my head in my own book, but what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the... the... an instance in which Congress has a choice of two models for... for constructing a statute, and it chooses one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to allow Congress to make that choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.998" offset="12791954">So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.994" offset="12847961">First, to say that I think what was going on in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have Congress in title VII addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.316" offset="12905221">And to use Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title VI model and not the title VII model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.178" offset="12928627">Now, to get to your question specifically, I think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question, Sullivan... I think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.094" offset="12964362">First, with all due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty opaque.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.818" offset="12983171">It certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary--</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.367" offset="14109466">Section 1981, section 1982, title VI, 1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.398" offset="14149590">And why would they not?</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.308" offset="14153143">The notion that you have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of Chicago medical school, you can't discriminate against her on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and expel her for complaining about your admissions policy makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.227" offset="14204865">In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what any administration might do about enforcement is not necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this Court's decision in Cannon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.762" offset="14250945">And it's reaffirmed it frankly--</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.127" offset="14256483">There are no vagaries in private enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.984" offset="14263902">Private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.678" offset="14286681">--Well, in this case, it has been known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to bring them about by allowing people to step forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.446" offset="14333701">The last point they make is that even if there's a cause of action, and even if the cause of action covers retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.827" offset="14383229">That makes no sense in law or in logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.171" offset="14396604">If the captain of the boys' basketball team joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls' basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended from their teams or dropped from the honor society in retaliation, it makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.139" offset="14464522">Either they both have... they've both been discriminated against on the basis of sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination or neither is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.170" offset="14504647">And in this case, it's going to be critically important that this valuable statute, which has meant so much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow them to come forward within the school itself and try to rectify these anomalies in and under title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.062" offset="14604225">Thank you.</text>
