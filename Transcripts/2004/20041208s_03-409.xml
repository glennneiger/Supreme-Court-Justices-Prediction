            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="7.133" offset="28526">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.587" offset="50260">The Trademark Act of 1946 also known as the Lanham Act requires the holder of a registered mark to show that another's used of its imitation of its mark is likely to cause confusion, what it cause mistake, or to deceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.935" offset="111700">In order to prevail an infringement action, the defendant in such an action has an affirmative defense of fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.149" offset="144509">If it can show that its use of the term is used otherwise than as a mark of a term which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the defendants goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.805" offset="203128">Petitioner KP Permanent Make-Up and respondent Lasting Impressions both sell permanent make-Up which is a mixture of pigment and liquid to be injected under the skin for cosmetic or medical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.087" offset="268330">Lasting and its licensee alleged in the District Court that KP infringed the Lasting's registered incontestable trademark and the term "Micro Colors" by using a version of the term in KP's advertising brochures.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.479" offset="333845">KP raise the affirmative defense of fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.334" offset="349309">The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of KP on its fair use defense the trademark infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.720" offset="374805">But it did so without considering whether KP's use of the term was likely to cause confusion among consumers as to the origin of KP's goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.542" offset="414093">The Ninth Circuit reversed finding that KP could only benefit from the fair use defense if there was no likelihood of confusion between its use of the term "Micro Color" and Lasting's mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.807" offset="467174">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court we vacate the judgment and hold that the defendant to an infringement action has no need to show that confusion is unlikely in order to make out the affirmative defense of fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.315" offset="529241">Nothing in the text of the statute setting out the affirmative defense indicates the defendants must make any showing regarding likelihood of confusion, and because congress was specific in requiring the mark holder to show likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.905" offset="595592">In order to make out an infringement claim, we decline Lasting's invitation to read Congress' silence on the significance of confusion under the fair use defense in order to require the defendant to show an absence of such likelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.475" offset="665809">Nor can the common law of unfair competition be used to require the defendant to shoulder a burden on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.798" offset="699141">The common law in fact tolerated some degree of confusion from a descriptive use of words contained in another person's mark, and it did so in order to preserve the common right to use descriptive terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.925" offset="751700">Finally, it would make little sense to require the defendant to disprove as part of its affirmative defense an element of the plaintiff's prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.794" offset="791092">If the defendant could do that it would have no need of an affirmative defense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.889" offset="811468">It follows from our conclusion that some degree of consumer confusion may co-exist with the fair use of the term contained in another's trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.691" offset="846681">But our holding does not foreclose the possibility that the extent of likely consumer confusion maybe relevant in assessing whether a defendant's use is objectively fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.493" offset="893910">We leave such questions for another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.379" offset="909479">The opinion is unanimous almost.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.911" offset="927556">Justice Scalia does not join in footnotes four and five and Justice Breyer does not join in footnote six.</text>
