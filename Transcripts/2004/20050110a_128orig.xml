            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="6.345" offset="25287">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.674" offset="38661">Because title to lands underlying navigable waters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty, this Court has long held that there is a strong presumption that each State receives title to such lands at statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.610" offset="94354">Under the Court's precedents, the United States cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise made that intention very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.733" offset="142838">Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case, the United States asserts that it received title to the submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there is no express statement, an unambiguous statement by Congress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.759" offset="214936">To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the United States identifies as ratifying the purported reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains with Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.130" offset="276480">Under the plain language of the statute, the proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.145" offset="324545">And this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.276" offset="329038">In this case it is undisputed by both of the parties and by the special master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included within the main clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.123" offset="428408">And why was Federal title to the monument not sufficient to retain title to the submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e) at all?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="121.602" offset="486400">Because of section 6(m), Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.405" offset="493610">Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides that the Federal Government retained all of the property it previously possessed with one important exception, except as provided in section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.303" offset="541153">Section 6 has two exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.793" offset="559125">Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.595" offset="630282">Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different set of properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.027" offset="648046">What section 6(e) did was to transfer to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of property, property that was used for the purposes or solely... for the sole purpose of... of fish and wildlife conservation under three designated statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.830" offset="719308">Those are the State... local-State fish and wildlife conservation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.707" offset="734772">Again, here it was... it is undisputed that Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.940" offset="755670">Therefore, the--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="189.937" offset="759745">--problem, as... you just said that... that the main clause is very, very narrow, and we're told by the Government that no wildlife reservation would come within that main clause, so that there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jonathan_s_franklin" startTime="210.629" stopTime="312.356">
            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="210.629" offset="842501">--The Government is incorrect, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.544" offset="850129">We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.258" offset="901016">And here's why the United States is correct on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.205" offset="908748">They argue in their brief that those properties were not included in the main clause because they were created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the Alaska Game Law of 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.369" offset="957440">In fact, Your Honors, those are the exact same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.751" offset="970919">The '43 Alaska Game Law simply restated the 1925 law with certain amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.906" offset="995579">What that means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the then-existing version.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.217" offset="1056810">These refuges were created in 1941 prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.018" offset="1083977">So those are two properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.938" offset="1091709">And... and actually the legislative history... we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative history because the statute is plain and also because there's a clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.393" offset="1121489">But the legislative history does indicate that Congress was specifically concerned about those two very large refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.514" offset="1150015">The Kenai and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.212" offset="1176764">And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern of the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service was that Alaska might not be able adequately to manage those properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.588" offset="1214276">But there was no such concern expressed with the monument that's at issue here because it was never going to be transferred to the State under the main clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.090" offset="1412284">Here, though, the test is set out in not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that is that there has to be an explicit action by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.000" offset="3119961">For some time cruise ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside... or asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of Alaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of Federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.029" offset="3180042">That was fixed, but it took an act of Congress to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.424" offset="3197597">There had to be an act of Congress to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge out in these, what they used to call, donut holes.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.503" offset="3221943">Alaska finds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress every time something comes up on its navigable waters that it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.667" offset="11618638">In order to establish that this is on the mainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.549" offset="11642149">And as the master recognized, these bodies of water are simply too substantial to ignore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.205" offset="11660748">In the case of these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on average 4 and a half miles wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.973" offset="11687811">It's... simply those intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish that this is... is part of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.707" offset="11718740">It's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, which is a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage for international navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.360" offset="11749355">That too precludes it from being ignored and treated as dry land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.547" offset="11766178">The failure of those two assimilations by itself is sufficient to establish that... that these... that these juridical bays do not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.912" offset="11803585">And even if that were not enough, the master went on to say that this would not be a well-marked indentation, that even if you were willing to assimilate these lands, it's still the case that the bay itself would not be... the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska has created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is passing by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.829" offset="11871295">For all those reasons, the juridical bays here are... are simply not well founded, and the master was correct in rejecting them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.178" offset="12348709">We think that this case falls squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in particular we relied on it primarily because it provides an actual textual basis for showing that the... the United States retain those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.947" offset="12399700">We do not need to go further and show purpose, although we certainly can.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.344" offset="12445362">He analyzed the Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the... the proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent retention clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.399" offset="12497502">And we think that's the right interpretation, and we think if we... if you focus on what the Court said on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.653" offset="12526550">The statement that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test is an afterthought at the end of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.835" offset="12559256">It's a statement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce the conclusion it's already reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.165" offset="12576601">It doesn't provide a basis for... for departing from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.274" offset="12589035">And in fact, as I hope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't make any sense, that they're simply... all of those lands that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall within the main clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.269" offset="12636996">The wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.741" offset="12650893">It's... the two wildlife refuges that they point to both the record shows were used for multiple purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.532" offset="12674090">They were not used solely for conservation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.863" offset="12683389">And in addition, they were... to the extent that those refuges adverted to any lands at all... any statutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not... not the 1943 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.594" offset="12734276">Furthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we believe that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has no answer for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.653" offset="12766563">One... one of those refuges, in particular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes within its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.239" offset="12800940">It clearly is being used for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.373" offset="12809404">We think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly that it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that this Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did intend to retain these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.407" offset="12853603">That was the point that... that this proviso, as Secretary Chapman himself indicated, and in fact, he stated in... the excerpt appears in page... on page 47, note 37 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.497" offset="12901982">He stated that these reservations... the land and water would be reserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.966" offset="12919850">He clearly was aware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to reserve both land and water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.003" offset="12943987">Finally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back and look at the big picture here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.859" offset="12959347">The United States' position overall results in a very sensible division of submerged lands in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.286" offset="12985051">We have not contested Alaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands here that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.771" offset="13011069">Rather, we've identified two areas where the Federal Government interests are paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.299" offset="13029146">First of all, with regard to drawing international... developing international principles to establish baselines, which creates these bays and... and pockets, that's a necessary consequence of what our foreign policy requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.065" offset="13084212">Secondly, where the United States has clearly reserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay National Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.134" offset="13108454">This park was set aside for the benefit of the entire Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.403" offset="13121515">We think that the Court should adopt the master's report in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.716" offset="13134785">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.401" offset="13165505">To get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact, advocating the principles of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.779" offset="13199047">It is not sufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservation that might include submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.270" offset="13225064">Congress has to take some action to explicitly ratify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.995" offset="13243977">That was what happened in the Idaho case, according to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.832" offset="13255262">And the United States has identified one statute and one statute only that it asserts can... ratifies the bay, and that's section 6(e), the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.089" offset="13296327">We think the plain language to section (e)... 6(e) is dispositive in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.540" offset="13318060">We are operating here under a clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.889" offset="13331540">The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption is, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the reservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended that the submerged lands... title to submerged lands be defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.190" offset="13384725">There was... the statute says such transfer shall not include.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.929" offset="13399667">There simply was no need for Congress to have included... to have specified that such transfer, the main clause transfer, shall not include submerged lands when they were not included... or excuse me... shall not include properties that were not included in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.528" offset="13462047">That includes Glacier Bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.366" offset="13577404">Therefore... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.117" offset="13580434">The main clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.912" offset="13583569">Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held that lands that did not fall within the main clause were included by the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.718" offset="13618782">It is important, though, to... to note this, that even if the statute is ambiguous... and we think that it is not...
