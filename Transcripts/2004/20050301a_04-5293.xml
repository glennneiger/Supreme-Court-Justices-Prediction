            <text syncTime="10.753" offset="42945">The question before the Court today is whether the trial court violated Carman Deck's rights to due process and a fair and reliable sentencing proceeding, as guaranteed by the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, when the trial court forced him to appear handcuffed to a belly chain and shackled in legirons before the jury which would determine whether he was to live or to die.</text>
