            <text syncTime="3221.795" offset="12887144">I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.237" offset="12904908">My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.069" offset="12940225">And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.413" offset="12953600">But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.414" offset="12989649">And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list... at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.653" offset="13046596">And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.906" offset="13099572">So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.912" offset="13167595">I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.284" offset="13205107">And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.631" offset="13270518">And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to... to divert the entire amount of administrative support for... for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3458.686" offset="13834658">But then there's a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.513" offset="13838002">Where could the money have come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.015" offset="13843958">In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.231" offset="13868826">No other contractor was apparently shorted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.172" offset="13876663">There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.175" offset="13892650">There was 55... $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.182" offset="13924728">There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.494" offset="13933923">They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor?</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.807" offset="13943223">Not that they had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.005" offset="13947925">They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.929" offset="13979690">That was their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.043" offset="13984078">But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.331" offset="14021277">No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.142" offset="14056490">There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.192" offset="14080731">The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.848" offset="14103301">Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.511" offset="14157949">I don't have enough money to pay you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.958" offset="14163801">There's no limit here on contract support costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.105" offset="14172369">It could be the secretarial amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.424" offset="14177593">They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.170" offset="14196611">And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.312" offset="14225241">Now, that's not what the... that's not what the statute permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.573" offset="14238198">That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.742" offset="14254916">With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.347" offset="14281352">There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.149" offset="14312594">Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.373" offset="14341433">So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.203" offset="14360764">Unless the Court has more questions.</text>
