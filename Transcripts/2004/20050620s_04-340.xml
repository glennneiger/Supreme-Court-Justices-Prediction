            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="8.174" offset="32601">Petitioners own and operate the San Remo Hotel in San Francisco, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.768" offset="63007">In 1993, in response to petitioners' request to convert their property from a residential hotel into a full time tourist hotel, the City Planning Commission required them to meet a number of conditions including the payment of a conversion fee of $567,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.339" offset="141270">Petitioners sued in Federal Court contending that the conditions constituted a taking of their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.190" offset="192679">The Federal District Court and Court of Appeals however, both found that petitioners had not yet been denied just compensation for the taking because they had never asked the State Court to provide them with just compensations.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.182" offset="240640">Thus, the courts held petitioners did not have a right Fifth Amendment injury under our decision Williamson County Regional Planning against the Hamilton Bank of Johnson City.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.151" offset="284526">The Federal Courts dismissed petitioners' unripened claim and agreed to abstain from deciding the rest of petitioners' claims while they return to State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.714" offset="318798">Back in State Court, petitioners raised essentially the same takings claims that they had tried to advance in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.543" offset="346070">After the California Courts denied petitioners' claim on the merits, they attempted to reraise the same issues back in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.745" offset="382955">Petitioners argued that they had reserved their federal claims under a case called England against Louisiana and a Board of Medical Examiners, and therefore that preclusion doctrine should not prevent them from retaining a fresh review of the underlying issues in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.635" offset="446485">They also argued that the full faith and credit statute which requires Federal Courts to give full faith and credit to state judicial proceedings should not apply because they had been forced to litigate their claims involuntarily in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.317" offset="501238">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.055" offset="512209">The Court held that the doctrine of issue preclusion prevented the Court from revisiting all issues that were actually decided in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.133" offset="544496">Here, because the Court found California takings law coextensive with federal law, all of the underlying issues raised by petitioners' federal complaint had already been decided in full by State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.748" offset="594965">The Court declined that petitioners' invitation to create a judicial exception to the full faith and credit statute rejecting the argument that Williamson County's requirement that takings claims must first be advanced in State Courts is unfair if applied to preclude relitigation in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.077" offset="676258">For reasons that are fully stated in our written opinion, we agree with the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.486" offset="693917">We do not read our England decision to permit the type of relitigation petitioners requested here.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.944" offset="719726">Moreover, none of our prior cases permit us to create a judicial exception to a validly enacted congressional statute simply to afford a litigant the opportunity to raise a federal claim in a federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.727" offset="774896">Finally, because we do not read Williamson County to preclude takings claims from being fully litigated in State Courts, there is no cause to except takings plaintiff from the full faith and credit statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.965" offset="823798">The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is therefore affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.468" offset="837799">The Chief Justice has written an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas have joined.</text>
