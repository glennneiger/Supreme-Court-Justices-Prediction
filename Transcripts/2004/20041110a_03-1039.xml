            <text syncTime="7.985" offset="31869">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.940" offset="43677">In this case, the Ninth Circuit violated AEDPA by reversing the California Supreme Court's decision affirming Payton's 1982 death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.030" offset="76069">The California Supreme Court applied the exact right case, namely Boyde v. California, in the very manner contemplated that... by that decision when assessing Payton's claim that his jury misunderstood the court's instructions and, in particular, factor (k) so as to unconstitutionally preclude consideration of his mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.888" offset="155481">The California Supreme Court's application of Boyde is precisely the type of good faith application of Federal constitutional law to which AEDPA demands deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.926" offset="191634">It is manifestly not objectively unreasonable, and this can be demonstrated in three aspects of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.811" offset="223190">The first is that the California Supreme Court recognized Boyde's specific holding that factor (k) facially comported with the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.863" offset="255373">The second is--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="64.894" offset="259553">Well, I thought the holding was that factor (k), standing alone, does... does not raise a... does... does not, standing alone, raise a question of reasonable probability of... of misunderstanding or misapplication of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.585" offset="338338">And that's not what they're claiming here.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.269" offset="348996">They're claiming here that there was something much more than (k) standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.015" offset="368013">As I understand it, they're claiming that the difference between this and Boyde and why this is not a standalone kind of case is that the prosecutor deliberately argued or argued law that was in fact wrong and... and continued to do so even after the court interrupted the argument and that the court never gave an instruction that corrected the erroneous statements of law that the prosecutor had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.622" offset="482429">So that's... that's why they're... they're saying this is not a Boyde situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.574" offset="502282">--Your Honor, Boyde has two specific components to its decision, which is, first, what factor (k) means standing alone, and you need to resolve that issue, which California did, in deciding the impact of the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="140.806" offset="563200">So that, first, you start from the premise, as the California Supreme Court did, in following Boyde, that factor (k) facially directed for consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.565" offset="602175">The... the mitigating evidence that Boyde held could be considered without a... (k) being a bar, was mitigating evidence about the... the character of the individual prior to or at least up to the moment of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.062" offset="668212">So this is... this is different kind of evidence, and I... I mean, this is post-crime evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.179" offset="688692">And... and I don't see that... that Boyde's holding is so broad as obviously to cover this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.124" offset="712411">It might be a... it would be a... a closer question if it hadn't been for the prosecutor's argument and the judge's failure to correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.669" offset="746580">But even... even without those elements, there would be a serious question whether Boyde covered this at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.988" offset="787853">I believe that the California Supreme Court correctly and... and reasonably determined that Boyde's holding encompassed Payton's character mitigating... Payton's mitigating character evidence because the holding in Boyde... or the issue directly presented by Boyde was whether factor (k) limited consideration to circumstances related to the crime or allowed for non-crime related mitigating evidence in deciding the appropriate penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.407" offset="913554">The prosecutor never suggested that background and character evidence could not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.817" offset="951171">So mustn't we take Boyde with that qualification when we have a case where the prosecutor, indeed, suggested that this information could not be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.990" offset="1019925">First, you must assess factor (k) facially and that's what Boyde did.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.910" offset="1035598">Then the next question is did the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k) mislead the jury to believe that they could no longer consider Payton's mitigating character evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.799" offset="1083141">And that would be the second component of Boyde which is a general test for assessing the reasonable likelihood a jury misunderstood the instructions in the context of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.851" offset="1115324">And the particularly relevant and important inquiry in this case is the California Supreme Court's application of Boyde's reasonable likelihood test in the context of the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.659" offset="1214589">You... you don't argue about what a statute means.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.117" offset="1232457">You can argue the facts, that it's mitigating or not mitigating or that it's extenuating or not extenuating, which is I think how you can interpret a lot of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.207" offset="1264744">But it... it seems to me that the trial judge does make a mistake when he says, well, well, this is for the... this is for them to argue when the... the point of the objection was that there was a misinterpretation of the instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.092" offset="9584327">But not under this case, though, because there wasn't anything that happened in Payton's trial which permitted a reasonable inference that in fact that evidence should be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.272" offset="9757048">And that means that the jury had to come back with a verdict of death.</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.985" offset="10751896">The... the Court earlier talked about other instructions as impacting upon the... the context of the case, and those were important considerations in Boyde, especially the observation that the jury was to consider any other evidence presented at either time in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.193" offset="10840712">But in the context of this case, Your Honor, it means nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.615" offset="10898390">If it didn't fit within there, even though they heard that evidence, they were instructed to ignore it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.911" offset="10943634">Now, being that there was no clear instruction to the jury that they had to consider factor (k) as being relevant evidence, the jury then likely put greater weight on counsel's argument, and that's why it becomes important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.174" offset="11008627">So the other instructions, when you put them all together, rather than putting in proper context what did occur in this case, in effect make it even harder for Bill Payton's position that the jury should consider factor (k) to be relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.708" offset="11982785">And I think that... that that's what Payton's argument demonstrates and the Ninth Circuit's analysis demonstrates, is that they are effectively equating a decision that the California Supreme Court's conclusion was incorrect with their personal... in their subjective opinion with a... with the standard that the decision must be objectively unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.454" offset="12073796">And in this case, the California Supreme Court's decision was manifesting not objectively unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.253" offset="12124996">We do have an example of what is objectively unreasonable, and that was cited in Payton's brief and that is a failure to consider particular facts or relevant law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.548" offset="12158119">And we know that that didn't occur in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.005" offset="12211931">So we have no question that the California Supreme Court identified the correct case and the correct principles within the case and considered all the necessary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.120" offset="12252473">And that should make this decision subject to deference under AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.044" offset="12284134">This Court last term provided additional guidance on how to assess the range of reasonable judgment through the lens of AEDPA in Yarborough v. Alvarado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.786" offset="12323109">And one of the things that the Ninth Circuit and Payton's analysis keeps overlooking is the... Boyde's specific holding concerning factor (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.015" offset="12368039">And when you analyze the... the range of reasonable judgment of the California Supreme Court concerning factor (k), the specific rule of factor (k), the... the range of reasonable judgment was less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.449" offset="12413701">The California Supreme Court had little to no leeway to conclude otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.703" offset="12430733">Boyde's holding is broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.476" offset="12437838">Boyde held that factor (k) was a broad, catchall mitigation instruction that allowed for any other circumstance that counseled a sentence less than death and specifically found that background and character fell within the ambit of factor (k).</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.746" offset="12606903">In both the first part of footnote 5, the... the... Chief Justice Rehnquist rejects the dissent's argument that the gravity of the crime focused the consideration to the circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.607" offset="12666358">Rather, it allowed the jury to assess the seriousness of what the defendant has done in light of what's the appropriate punishment, and that involves a consideration of the defendant's background and character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.003" offset="12711915">And then the last part of footnote 5 expressly recognizes that factor (k) allows for consideration of good character evidence, and good character evidence is only relevant to a decision about whether the person should live or die, not to circumstances related to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.586" offset="12782341">And good character evidence under Payton and the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of factor (k) would not and could not, whether it existed pre or post-crime, fall under the meaning of factor (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.162" offset="12820584">So the footnote 5 actually bolsters the ultimate broad interpretation that the California Supreme Court adopted when it applied Boyde... Boyde's specific holding concerning factor (k) to the analysis of Payton's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.766" offset="12882965">And although they did, in footnote 5, distinguish the fact that it did not involve post-crime evidence in mitigation, it didn't decide the question.</text>
