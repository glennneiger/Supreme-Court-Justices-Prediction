            <text syncTime="16.054" offset="64157">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.504" offset="73979">This case is a challenge to Michigan's $100 per truck flat annual fee that is imposed on all trucks that are registered to do point-to-point operations in the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.945" offset="115775">We submit that this fee, this flat per truck fee, has the same impermissible effects on interstate commerce as the two flat truck fees that were struck down by this Court in American Trucking Associations v. Scheiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.337" offset="165303">In the American Trucking Associations v. Scheiner case, this Court looked at the practical effect of these fees and found that because of their unapportioned structure, that the fees had four interrelated types of impermissible effects on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.846" offset="223295">First, the Court found that these kinds of flat fees were a financial barrier against out-of-state motor carriers even coming into the State that imposed the... the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.237" offset="264882">There's no question in this case that the Michigan flat fee has the same kind of protectionist quality.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="71.606" offset="286407">Well, it... it does for trucks that want to deliver things within the State of Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="78.295" offset="313156">Yes, it... it discriminates and it... it has an exclusory effect on trucks... out-of-state carriers that want to compete in the... and bring their trucks across the... the border of Michigan and compete against local carriers for intrastate hauls.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.089" offset="388284">Is it deterring anybody?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Digges, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="100.508" offset="401972">There was not a trial below.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.660" offset="406570">So we don't have that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.810" offset="411167">We believe that as in the Scheiner case, these... these tendencies are inherent there.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.045" offset="428095">Because of the structure of the fee, it not only has this effect, it has what this Court called a hydraulic pressure effect, and that is to... for carriers, once they have paid this fee as an entrance fee, to pull their trucks out of interstate commerce and to concentrate them into... in the State of Michigan in the local activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.193" offset="500715">And that... in fact, the State acknowledges that.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.727" offset="514821">Below, the State said that motor carriers should allocate or dedicate their trucks to the State of Michigan in order to avoid these consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.381" offset="545437">And even the Michigan Court of Appeals recognized that, saying a local carrier would be discouraged from operating in interstate commerce.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="143.904" offset="575530">Of course, it also... I mean, you say it... it favors the in-state... intrastate carrier because if you're doing nothing but intrastate carriage, you... you amortize the $100 over many more miles, whereas the interstate carrier, much of whose business is out-of-state, doesn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.602" offset="666331">On the other hand, you can certainly argue that... that this tax discriminates against intrastate carriers in... in another respect, that is to say, interstate carriers who... who do nothing within the State do not pay it, whereas the... the Michigan carrier that does a lot of interstate business but if he does one piece of intrastate business... interstate business, he still pays it.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.670" offset="778658">Isn't that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Digges, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="195.937" offset="783673">Well, Your Honor, I think what... what that's saying... and I know that was the argument made in the Solicitor General's brief... is that you can discriminate against one component of interstate commerce, those carriers that want to actually compete and do intrastate business in the State, as long as you give a benefit to another component of interstate commerce, those who just wish to operate in the... in the State of Michigan in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.600" offset="866325">Well, it's not so much that you necessarily can do it, but it... it sort of interrupts the... the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown back on a... on... on a practical effects analysis under Pike.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.493" offset="917943">I think what happens is that... that there are the segment of carriers that would like to compete against intrastate carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.080" offset="940304">The fact that other carriers may be getting a break in terms of regulatory fees... and we don't know that to be the truth, getting the other interstate carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.733" offset="970919">It's the Boston Stock Exchange, and I think it was said again in the Scheiner case that... that you can't discriminate among interstate carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.756" offset="998922">And as we pointed out in our brief, you could set up a situation in which a... a State discriminated in favor of interstate carriers in situations or industries where their locals had no interest in competing, but where their... their locals were interested in competing, they could set up a discriminatory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.551" offset="1070184">So you can protect timber industry in... in Oregon and--</text>

            <text syncTime="460.677" offset="1842678">That is, there are many situations in which there is some kind of licensing fee that is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount, although some people who are licensed will be doing because in other States and have to get licenses there as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.340" offset="1921358">The example that was featured in the... in the briefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed, say, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any break on his D.C.

            <text syncTime="512.811" offset="2051239">I think there are a variety of flat fees that would be unaffected by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.096" offset="2064300">There are fees that would be administrative charges and... and if all the State is doing is charging, for example, the cost of a background investigation or the cost of a truck inspection, a fixed cost, then it's fair to ask the carrier to pay a fixed fee or to ask the taxpayer to pay a fixed fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.539" offset="2126054">With respect to the bar fees, they are obviously different than the trucking industry and... and the taxation of an instrumentality in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.145" offset="2160536">But we think that there may be impracticalities in apportioning a bar fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.581" offset="2178299">You could have an attorney in his office in Virginia that is working for a California customer or California client that is being... for a case that is being tried in the court system of Oregon, and then for transaction work, he could be working for a customer or a client in... in Missouri for... a multi state.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.994" offset="2255935">So it may be difficult to apportion fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.794" offset="2263144">We haven't really examined that.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.062" offset="2268160">But we know from this Court's decisions that... that is easy and can be apportioned for truck fees, and truck fees... this Court said in Scheiner that the technology is now available to look at the extent of the activity and the taxpayer in... in... of the truck in the State, and later on in a subsequent decision said that you can easily track large physical objects over States.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.026" offset="2352065">So you can apportion these fees on trucks to their mileage in the State, to their loads, to the gross revenue associated with the--</text>

            <text syncTime="599.267" offset="2396996">I thought that that... that flat fee was applicable to every motor carrier that went on the roads in Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.331" offset="2481319">So like a lot of... like all interstate commerce, you can always... as... as the Court said in Nippert, you can always find... carve out a local activity to say that this is going to be the focus of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.270" offset="2521025">I think a problem here is with the... the approach taken by the State and the Solicitor General is they suggest that you go back to the days in which you're trying to draw a line between interstate and intrastate activity, this time not because the intrastate activity is going to be immune from the tax, but this time because you're going to have some separate, different kind of test applicable to something that clearly is subject to Commerce Clause protections, but is... is, in their view, subject to a more lenient Commerce Clause protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.289" offset="2637113">And I don't think this Court wants to retreat back to the days of having to draw a line between interstate and intrastate commerce and... and then having separate tests.</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.190" offset="10748656">The United States as amicus curiae supports the State in American Trucking and the petitioner in Mid-Con.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.093" offset="10772271">With respect to American Trucking, in our view the central question in resolving the constitutional issue is not whether it would be possible to apportion the intrastate fee on a more precise basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.734" offset="10818873">The question is whether the Constitution requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.520" offset="10830054">And in the prior cases that we've cited in our brief, both the older cases dealing specifically with intrastate transportation and the more recent cases dealing with authority to engage in other intrastate businesses, this Court has repeatedly upheld the authority of States and municipalities to charge flat fees for the privilege of engaging in the local business within the jurisdiction during the... the relevant period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.965" offset="11007791">And you're... you're just dragging back in this... this inquiry into whether it's really interstate or... or rather local.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2759.619" offset="11038407">--Well, with... with respect, Your Honor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the notion that there is a bright, absolute line between intrastate activities which are subject to plenary regulation by the States without any Commerce Clause inquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune from State regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.049" offset="11120118">The Court has recognized that the question is more complicated than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.084" offset="11132238">But in cases like Jefferson Lines, for instance, the Court held that the sales price of a ticket for an interstate bus trip could be taxed in... in its entirety by the State in which the ticket was purchased because the sale of the ticket was regarded as a separate, discrete event properly severable from the underlying interstate transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.832" offset="11219278">And the case for severance is all the more powerful here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.636" offset="11234534">That is, here we're dealing not with a... an aspect of an interstate transaction, we're dealing with point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.574" offset="11270269">It's true that those may be undertaken by trucks that also do interstate business, and it's even true that in some instances the intrastate load may be carried on the same truck at the same time that it's also carrying goods between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.232" offset="11324918">But the intrastate haul is itself a discrete commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.869" offset="11339442">To the shipper it's wholly irrelevant, in most instances, that the... the truck is also doing an interstate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.190" offset="11364728">And to differentiate this case from Scheiner, one of the things that the Court has looked at in the dormant Commerce Clause inquiry is the risk of multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.213" offset="11396807">And the Court doesn't just mean multiple taxation in... in the abstract because it's necessarily going to be the case that an entity that does business in many States will be taxed in many States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.668" offset="11438602">Rather the question is whether there's an undue risk of multiple taxation on the same transaction or the same conduct or the same activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.174" offset="11472666">And that was at real risk in Scheiner because if you imagine a truck that's delivering cargo from Maine to Florida and passing through several States on the way, and it's required to pay a fee that is, in essence, a fee for entering the State, has nothing to do with the mileage traveled within the jurisdiction, it's entirely reasonable to say that the imposition of those cumulative trips... cumulative taxes for a single haul of goods from Maine to Florida is an instance of multiple taxation of the same event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.959" offset="11591784">Here we don't have a problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.811" offset="11599203">The tax is being levied solely on point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.097" offset="11616340">If a particular truck also makes point-to-point hauls in some other State within the calendar year, it may be subject to two taxes, but they can't be characterized as two taxes on the same conduct or the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.273" offset="11673078">The second aspect of... of Scheiner--</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.742" offset="11682900">Yes, it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.759" offset="11686975">I mean, if... if this... this truck is making one... one haul, it's carrying some goods from Texas to... to Maine, but some other goods it picks up along the way within Tennessee and just carries it to another place within Tennessee, and then it picks some other goods in New Jersey, carries it elsewhere to New Jersey, you're going to be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.322" offset="11773283">It seems to me it's... it's one trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.190" offset="11784673">We never used to... used to divide railroads on the basis of well, the ICC has jurisdiction over just the interstate portions and... and the two stops within a State can be regulated by the State.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2958.867" offset="11835455">--I mean, I think you're right that it wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas segment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of goods between States as a discrete, separable event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.806" offset="11879131">But if the truck is picking up goods at one point in Texas and depositing them at another point in Texas, again from the shipper's point of view, that's clearly a discrete transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.780" offset="11919047">The shipper is unlikely to have any interest in whether the same truck is simultaneously carrying goods among the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.684" offset="11946736">And it's reasonable to regard that as a discrete event that is taxable by the State in which it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.838" offset="11971291">The other point to make about Scheiner is that even if we assume, as the petitioner argues, that the average interstate truck that makes some point-to-point hauls within Michigan will do so less frequently than the average truck that does business solely within that State, there's still a whole different class of interstate truckers that makes substantial use of Michigan's roads that could be charged taxes on the basis of mileage traveled and they're being let off the hook because the State has chosen to focus this tax on intrastate activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.194" offset="12108696">Petitioners'response to this is that you can't discriminate against one class and then make up for it by... by discriminating in favor of a different class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.265" offset="12140983">And if this were, to use title VII terminology, a disparate treatment case, we would agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.085" offset="12164284">That is, if a State overtly discriminates against one class of interstate or out-of-state activities and on the face of the law those people are treated less favorably, then we would entirely agree that the State couldn't make up for it by giving more favorable treatment to a different class of out-of-state entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.213" offset="12236800">But here the petitioner is making what amounts to a disparate impact claim, and the essence of a disparate impact claim is not that any particular individual has suffered unfair treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.168" offset="12276611">The way you prove a disparate impact claim is to show the effect cumulatively upon the class, upon interstate truckers in this case in the aggregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.841" offset="12315272">And there's really no way to feel any kind of confidence that interstate truckers won't do better as a group by virtue of Michigan's decision to focus this tax on intrastate activity rather than on the basis of mileage, which would sweep in a lot of out-of-state truckers that are not currently covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.136" offset="12388519">I'd like to speak briefly at least about the... the Mid-Con case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.670" offset="12402625">And in our view the best way of understanding... to... to return to the historical antecedents of the current SSRS provision, in its original form, as enacted in 1965, the statute said it's not an unreasonable burden of... on interstate commerce to require an interstate carrier to register its Federal certificate so along as you do so in accordance with the standards of the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.868" offset="12499383">If you go beyond those standards, it's an unreasonable burden on commerce.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Digges, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3320.278" offset="13281071">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.099" offset="13308343">I'd like to just briefly cover three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.384" offset="13317433">First, I believe that... that is accurate to say that the Solicitor General's position is returning us to the pre-Complete Auto days of line-drawing, but more than that, the Solicitor General's position is ignoring the practical effect of these fees on taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.109" offset="13368424">I think the... the citation to the Peddler v. Drummer line of cases illustrates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.845" offset="13387337">The only difference between the Peddler cases and the Drummer cases was that in the... in the Nippert case and... and the Drummer case, they looked at the practical effect on an out-of-state salesman and whether that salesman would be discouraged by the $50 fee that was being imposed from coming into the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.938" offset="13447732">In the Wagner case, they simply said that the fee fell on an essentially local event, didn't look at the form of the fee, didn't look at the form of the fee on the out-of-state salesman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.675" offset="13482632">I don't think it can be disputed that to out-of-state... that out-of-state salesmen would be equally discouraged from coming into a State because a $50 fee or a $100 fee, whether or not they're carrying the goods with them in at that time or whether the goods are later mailed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.284" offset="13541042">So, again, it is returning to the line-drawing issues, and really there is no test that is made as to, after you... you draw these lines, what the appropriate test should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.909" offset="13579598">The second point is it... with respect to the administrative practicality of apportioning these fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.563" offset="13602168">The purpose of apportionment would not be, as in a highway tax, to... to show the amount of highway damage that was done by a truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.883" offset="13631530">The purpose of apportionment here is simply to show the extent of the taxpayer's level of activity in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.037" offset="13656085">It would be like a general revenue tax in which we're trying to allocate the taxpayer's activity to particular States, make sure that that taxpayer is paying its fair share of the State's costs with respect... of the State's generic costs, in this case, generic regulatory costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.630" offset="13710420">So, again, I think that apportionment would be very easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.498" offset="13725989">As Justice Scalia said, the trucking industry is willing to take the onus of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.367" offset="13741453">We bill by the mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.002" offset="13747931">You could do it on number of loads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.271" offset="13757022">You could do it in a lot... a lot of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.154" offset="13764545">And by apportioning the fee, you eliminate the burden and you make the out-of-state carrier, who would be otherwise prohibited from only hauling a load or two... he would then have the ability to haul that load and... and not be discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.531" offset="13814073">The final area I'd like to talk about a little bit is the need for additional... the need for evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.602" offset="13842390">Again, in the Nippert and the Scheiner cases, there... they... they... it was expressly said that there was no need for evidence in the cases because in the general average of instances, the out-of-state trucker will always pay more than the in-state trucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.742" offset="13894949">And in answer to your question, Justice Stevens, I think it was recognized in those cases that there would be some exceptions to that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.896" offset="13919504">There would be a few out-of-state carriers that would operate more heavily in the State than in-state carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.531" offset="13938103">But that exception wasn't... wasn't what was going to happen and the most often, and that the average of instances, it would always work to the disadvantage of the out-of-state carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.970" offset="13971853">And... and the final point is that with respect to evidence, you have here also a failure of internal consistency test, and this Court has said a number of times that failure internal... of internal consistency is not a test related... it doesn't rely on specific facts but it relies on hypotheticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.765" offset="14043011">And in this instance, I think there's a very clear failure of internal consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.069" offset="14060251">Like in Scheiner, there's a cumulative burden on an out-of-state trucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.937" offset="14075716">If a trucker wants to operate in intrastate commerce around the country, it has to... and just haul one load in every State, it has to pay 48 times a $100 fee or pay $4,800 in eligible... in order to be eligible to haul in all of those States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.531" offset="14138096">So that illustrates how that's going to balkanize commerce, that that carrier is not going to be able to pay that kind of entrance fee nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.802" offset="14167144">So that carrier will operate in less intrastate activities in... in only a few States or maybe none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.706" offset="14194730">And again, we think that that defeats the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.075" offset="14204238">When Congress passed economic deregulation of the trucking industry, that they wanted to open it up to out-of-state carriers to be able to augment their interstate loads.</text>
