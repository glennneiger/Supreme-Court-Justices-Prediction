            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="68.460" offset="273763">Justice O'Connor, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="83.470" offset="333845">For 70 years the Federal courts have deferentially reviewed both the efficacy and the wisdom of legislation, even when it affects property interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.813" offset="383164">This case squarely presents the question, should we now turn back the clock?</text>
            <text syncTime="100.476" offset="401868">We make two main arguments: first, that the substantially advance test should not be a standalone test for determining whether regulation affects a taking because such a test is fundamentally divorced from a major principle of the regulatory takings doctrine itself, economic injury; and second, if there is such a standalone test, it ought to be no more searching than the rational basis test of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.840" offset="503327">As this Court has stated in First English, the Just Compensation Clause is not designed to interfere with the ability of government to affect property interests, but rather to require just compensation in the event of an otherwise valid taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.051" offset="572186">In this particular case, we had a circumstance where one single Federal judge conducted a fact trial where she evaluated the demeanor and credibility of one expert from Chevron and one expert from the State of Hawaii in order to make a determination of whether or not garden variety economic regulation was constitutional or unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.235" offset="664869">There was no... the test applied would have been no different if this had been an act of Congress instead of an act of the Hawaii State legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.408" offset="697574">In this case, what the district court did was wholly inconsistent, we submit, with any reasonable concepts of federalism, and if it had been an act of Congress that this district court judge was sitting in judgment of, it would have been entirely inconsistent with the respect that this Court has consistently said is due to a co-equal branch of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.349" offset="777300">A particular irony of the way the Ninth Circuit applied what it believed to be the Agins test, which it indicated the standard of review fell somewhere between rational basis and rough proportionality, but the... the supreme irony of that, we suggest, is that if that test were applied, it would have the effect of overruling the very cases that Agins cited in supporting the language it... it used, that if indeed you have this type of intermediate scrutiny, cases like Nectow and Euclid v. Village of Ambler could not stand because, as this Court has said, those cases set out a rational basis test, whether the object was in the power of the legislature or... or the municipal authority and whether the means used to achieve it were rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.733" offset="986906">And the test the Ninth Circuit set up in this case and, as applied by the district court, would have overruled those very cases because there would have been a fact trial necessary to determine whether or not the... the zoning ordinances at issue in that... in those cases were efficacious or inefficacious.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="264.649" offset="1058586">Well, does the fact that discrete or individual property rights are being affected and, indeed, taken justify some higher level of scrutiny than we would apply to general economic regulation by the State?</text>

            <text syncTime="283.679" offset="1134655">We... we would think, first of all, this... this Court has established that it doesn't look at whether some stick in the bundle of rights is affected by the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.696" offset="1170704">It looks at the parcel as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.082" offset="1176242">And second, this Court has said that it is shying away from per se tests, and indeed, it... it looks at these types of cases under the rubric of Penn Central where the primary factor that the Court looks at is the extent of the economic injury and also the extent to which it interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.220" offset="1260878">A particular irony of this case is that the Ninth Circuit has said this particular statute of the Hawaii legislature affects a taking without any regard to whether or not it caused any economic injury to Chevron at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.491" offset="1321900">This Court has found that when the major flaw in legislation or the... the major argument as to why legislation should be deemed to be unconstitutional turns on the legitimacy of the legislation, that finds a natural home in the due process analysis, rather than in an analysis that looks at whether or not the legislation actually effects a taking or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.181" offset="1436630">Indeed, this Court, Your Honor, despite what it said in Agins in relying on the due process analysis, has never found a taking based upon doubt as to the likely efficacy of economic legislation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="375.368" offset="1501414">Well, Your Honor, I think that in... in Del Monte Dunes, every opinion in the case discussed this language and... and said that the Court has never indicated that this sets out a more exacting test than rational basis other than in the rough proportionality context of Nollan and Dolan.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.749" offset="1586991">And I think the language used in Agins, which came from due process cases, has somewhat taken on a life of its own, and the lower courts and the... the supreme courts of the several States have had quite... have had a great deal of difficulty in... in dealing with what exactly the language means.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.718" offset="1654805">We believe, as we've set forth in our brief, that to the extent it establishes this intermediate scrutiny, as the Ninth Circuit felt it did, that it would be dicta in Agins, but if the Court viewed it as not dicta, we think that the Court ought to reconsider the constitutional rule under the standards for such reconsideration that the Court has identified in cases like Payne v. Tennessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.352" offset="3157368">The number of cases that the Court has looked at in which it has indicated that it is not going to get into the business of determining efficacy or wisdom is, indeed, legion, and really since the New State Ice era, the Lochner era, this Court has not engaged in that type of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.195" offset="3240751">And in fact, in Lochner itself, the... the Court stated that we do not believe in the soundness of the views which uphold this law, and one can take that and look at the Ninth Circuit opinion in this case in which the Ninth Circuit does essentially the same thing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="852.799" offset="3411174">Justice O'Connor, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="865.142" offset="3460493">The reasons why this Court has applied the rational basis standard to review economic legislation of the sort involved here go to the heart of the role of courts in our democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.697" offset="3506782">Legislatures, not courts, are elected to enact the laws, and courts, therefore, do not substitute their judgment for the economic wisdom of legislation for that of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.151" offset="3544503">And courts typically lack the fact-finding ability and expertise of legislatures, especially to make the sort of predictive judgments that the Ninth Circuit relied upon in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.131" offset="3588493">These fundamental principles about the role of courts in our society would be greatly undermined if a plaintiff could simply... could obtain heightened scrutiny of legislation by simply recasting his claim as a takings claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.672" offset="3642619">And therefore, it's not surprising that this notion doesn't find support in the Just Compensation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.821" offset="3667278">When the government affirmatively exercises the power of eminent domain to take property, the requirement that compensation be paid doesn't rest on the proposition that the legislation is ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.082" offset="3716284">To the contrary, the taking presupposes that the... that the action will... will further a legitimate governmental purpose or at least that the legislature could have rationally so concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.713" offset="3766753">Any inquiry into the legitimacy of the governmental purpose or whether it will be served, instead, arises under the Public Use Clause, not whether there is a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.313" offset="3813251">And if those purposes are not served or the legislature could not rationally so conclude, it is not a public use and it's invalid and it should be enjoined, the consequences not to trigger the payment of... of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.976" offset="3867899">And the... the same analytical approach applies for regulatory takings.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.435" offset="3885662">In deciding whether there is a regulatory taking, this Court has developed tests to look to see whether the nature of the government's restrictions are essentially the functional equivalent of the exercise of the power of eminent domain or appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.802" offset="3943131">And that... that the Court has done by looking principally at the impact on the property owner, not the rationality of what the legislature has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.726" offset="3974896">That has not been part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.295" offset="3981166">For example, in the Lucas case, the... the test for finding a taking is whether all economic value has been destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.725" offset="4010841">Or in the physical appropriation cases, the Court has said that's such a fundamental interference burden on the landowner that there is a per se taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.405" offset="4041561">And similarly under the Penn Central test, the central inquiry is on the economic impact and the interference with investment-backed expectations, things that look to the impact on the... on the landowner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.727" offset="5694903">I would point out that throughout the course of history, the Court has sometimes used takings and due process kind of interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.408" offset="5725623">And we... we quote, for example, the... this Court's Rowan decision which refers to the plaintiff's constitutional claim as saying that the regulatory action violates the Fifth Amendment because it constitutes a taking without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.212" offset="5772748">I think sometimes the Court has used or parties have used those terms interchangeably, and that may well be what the Court was doing in Agins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.129" offset="5808483">And I think if you look at Penn Central where that phraseology was... was used, the same is true where the Court was... was relying upon the due process part of Goldblatt, and the Court put the word taking in... in quotes, I think perhaps indicating that it was not looking at a literal taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.677" offset="6214635">And then the Court said, but the seemingly absolute protection of the Just Compensation Clause in the context of a... of a regulation that affects that kind of appropriation, as opposed to an outright condemnation of it, that that protection is subject to an implied limitation that is exists to allow the government to serve its purposes, as Pennsylvania Coal described it, if the government could hardly function at all, if it were required to pay for every interference with property rights occasioned by its regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.757" offset="11074978">One reading of the Takings Clause, the Just Compensation Clause, would be that the government should pay compensation in those circumstances where it is depriving property owners of protected property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.586" offset="11130253">But in Pennsylvania Coal, the Court said in the regulatory takings area, because of the need for the government to function, we are going to allow the government in certain circumstances to... to interfere with rights without paying for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.249" offset="11184901">And the inquiry that we're saying the Court should make is whether that need exists and whether the burden being imposed serves that need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.485" offset="11225861">And... and again, I'd like to emphasize that this should not be considered an unfamiliar concept in constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.794" offset="11255118">This Court has consistently recognized that when the government seeks to intrude on protected... rights protected by explicit provisions in the Constitution, on the basis that its needs, its legitimate interests require that intrusion, then the court's role to enforce the constitutional protections is to make that inquiry into whether the need is... is being actually served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.068" offset="11368176">Now, I'd like to at... at this point emphasize that our position is not that no deference may be given to legislative judgments under this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.668" offset="11414570">Our position is simply that it must be more than a mere rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.529" offset="11438080">The reason why the Court, in repudiating the Lochner-era cases, has held that mere rationality is enough to satisfy the constitutional standard is that there was no specific constitutional prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.525" offset="11494087">In the... and... and the Court specifically distinguished those circumstances in which there is a constitutional right--</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.064" offset="11976202">The... the Just Compensation Clause is limited to rights of private property, would not extend... and I don't believe there's anything in this Court's precedents that would require it that it extend to the kinds of laws, minimum wage laws, wage and hour provisions, regulations on the size of bread loaves, that were the professional licensing requirements that were the subject of the Lochner-era cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.244" offset="12076931">And the Due Process Clause extends even to expectancy interests or... or reliance interests on governmental benefit programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.244" offset="12112875">Nothing in our position here would... would apply to that because those, we don't believe, have ever been held and... and should not be held to be covered within the specific provision of the Just Compensation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.931" offset="12175673">Your Honors, in Nollan and Dolan and First English, this Court recognized that the Just Compensation Clause is not a poor relation among the provisions of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.789" offset="12219141">In First English, the Court recognized that the constitutional provisions by their very nature limit the freedom and flexibility of the government in order to protect constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.767" offset="12263027">And the Court in First English said that the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment is one such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.250" offset="12288940">And our position here is that this constitutional right, that private property shall not be taken without just compensation, should be entitled to the same protection as the other constitutional protections in the Bill of Rights, and that just as with respect to those rights, when the government seeks to intrude on those interests, the court should properly inquire into the nature of that intrusion and the justification for that intrusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.683" offset="12442645">Your Honors, this case is not about compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.295" offset="12465110">Indeed, Chevron's discussion of compensation... the first time that that occurred in the entirety of this case was in its brief in this Court, as we point out, in particular, in footnote 6 at page 11 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.412" offset="12521639">This case is, indeed, about whether this economic regulation is legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.864" offset="12543373">The Ninth Circuit's test was it doesn't work well enough, so it is illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.065" offset="12564167">That type of a test belongs under the Due Process Clause, not under the Just Compensation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.957" offset="12591752">This Court has time and time again said that it is not going to set up separate per se tests except in very limited circumstances and, indeed, it's not going to divide parcels in the way Chevron suggests here and whether it's in Tahoe-Sierra or Penn Central or Keystone, the Court has said, absent taking all value or use of the property or in Loretto, in the case of a physical invasion, it is going to allow these types of regulatory takings tests to be judged under Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.651" offset="12722573">What Chevron is arguing for here is a separate test outside of Penn Central, divorced from economic impact, that concerns solely legitimacy of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.168" offset="12768653">We suggest that that belongs in due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.171" offset="12784640">We believe that what the Court should do is say that what was stated in Agins does not state a standalone test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.768" offset="12815047">Tests for judging the legitimacy of a regulation belong in due process based upon a rational basis test and that other than the very limited per se categories that this Court has established, regulatory takings claims depend on economic impact and belong under the Penn Central analysis.</text>
