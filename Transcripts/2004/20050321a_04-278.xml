            <text syncTime="951.768" offset="3806981">For two reasons the holders of restraining orders lack a property right to police enforcement of those orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.255" offset="3828924">First, Respondent's claim has to be evaluated in light of the fundamental background principles that private citizens lack a judicially cognizable interest in arrest and in prosecution of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.138" offset="3876467">And that executive decisions not to enforce criminal statutes are presumptively beyond the scope of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.293" offset="3901127">Nothing in the Colorado statute reflects an intent to depart from those background presumptions and to create an individual right to enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.402" offset="3929548">Unlike statutes where this Court has recognized a protected property interest, the provisions at issue here did not regulate the Plaintiff or Respondent, but rather regulate a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.391" offset="3969463">And the provisions do not mention the restraining order holder, much less state that she has an entitlement to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.917" offset="3999660">In addition, the provisions do not afford the holder of restraining orders procedural protections or judicial review of the sort that this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.613" offset="4130377">And second, which has the benefit... it has the effect basically of creating a new arrest statute that lowers the threshold of what conduct is criminal from something that would be a freestanding crime to basically just violating one of the terms of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.983" offset="4647915">Because they had affirmatively restrained him, I think that that would be a case where the state had created the danger or increased the vulnerability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.926" offset="4775602">And under... as Mr. Eastman mentioned, under Gonzaga and this Court's 1983 cases, that when a statute speaks in terms of the regulated party instead of the protected party, there is no implication of an intent to create a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.360" offset="4829414">And I think that that principle would apply even more clearly in the context of the state rights, because there there is a question of imposing federal liability which shouldn't really be done in the absence of an indication that the state really meant to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.680" offset="4878629">Another reason is... not to assume that there is a property right here, is that the state statute does not create any sort of procedural remedies or judicial remedies which this Court has in the past taken as an indication that the state really did mean to create a protective right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.625" offset="5046439">But even aside from that, you basically have to adopt not simply a question of what the state law says, but what the federal courts are going to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.415" offset="5081652">And we are of the opinion that given what a tremendous departure it would be, what a procedural innovation it would be to give complaining witnesses essentially a right in the process, that in the absence of a very clear statement, the federal court should not imply a right or imply... should not infer, rather, that the state legislature intended to create a right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.674" offset="12874606">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.167" offset="12896653">I want to go pack to Justice Scalia's point about the property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.314" offset="12925179">This is such a unique claim of a property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.959" offset="12935732">I think it would be appropriate to find that even if you were to accept Justice Stevens' contention of a contract, an ADT type of guarantee of protective services, that looks a lot more like the type of entitlements under Roth that this Court has recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.962" offset="12995814">I think it may well be the case that you never reach a property interest in the enforcement against somebody else, that that's a different thing in kind from this traditional contract protective services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.586" offset="13046282">So if there was a statute that said, when somebody has a protective order that implicates... particularly when there is a finding of dangerousness that's been made by a court that has nothing to do with the restraining order that was issued here, and that the police are obligated to provide 24-hour, seven days a week police... squad car out in front of her house until she goes to testify at a hearing, for example, that would be I think a property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.385" offset="13153489">But it would meet the criteria that this Court set out in Gonzaga, that it's defined in terms of rights to her, not just benefits that might flow from a criminal law more generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.764" offset="13194971">It's phrased in terms of the person benefitting and it has an unmistakable focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.499" offset="13213989">That's the phrase from Gonzaga.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.386" offset="13221512">And that there is an intent to create a private remedy as well, not just the private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.967" offset="13239798">I think those kind of things would give rise to a Roth type property interest that would lead to the invocation of procedural due process requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.343" offset="13269368">What about the willful and wanton... suppose the facts were just as they say, long-standing practice, not responding, doing nothing, doing nothing here despite evidence of serious danger, and being told you shouldn't do anything, don't pay any attention he'll come home, would that show willful and wanton?</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.655" offset="13338540">I believe under Colorado law, that would show willful and wanton and their tort claim would be available against the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.282" offset="13361110">But it's precisely because of that tort claim is available and only on those limited circumstances that I think you cannot read the Colorado legislature as having created a property interest here, because the remedies that would be available would not be so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.592" offset="13418266">We would not be limited to willful and wanton conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.927" offset="13427670">We would have all sorts of remedies beyond what the State of Colorado specifically said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.631" offset="13446478">And you would go a long way toward making constitutional provisions the font of Colorado tort law, and completely supplant--</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.903" offset="13499559">I think there is nothing in this statute that would even make it reasonable for the Colorado Supreme Court to hold that there is a property interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.988" offset="13523905">And to go back to your earlier point about Bishop, it's not a determinative rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.953" offset="13543758">You give deference to the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.532" offset="13550028">But when the Tenth Circuit's decision is not based on any even developments in Colorado law, and based on a Colorado statute and takes the step that this statute simply doesn't comply with, I don't think you need to give the kind of absolute deference here that you might have given other cases.</text>
