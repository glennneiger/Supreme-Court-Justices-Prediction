            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="8.513" offset="33959">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.359" offset="53394">California is one of at least nine states that authorize the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.219" offset="84846">The question presented in this case is whether the power vested in Congress by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the power to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.697" offset="186723">Respondents are seriously ill California residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.546" offset="202083">Their doctors have concluded after unsuccessfully prescribing a host of conventional medicines that marijuana is the only drug available that provides effective treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.913" offset="251611">Both women have been using marijuana as a medication for several years pursuant to their doctors’ recommendation, and both rely heavily on cannabis to function on a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.020" offset="299990">While respondents’ activities do not violate California law, they do violate the Federal Controlled Substance Act of 1970, a comprehensive regulatory statute which, among other things, categorically prohibits the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.138" offset="384522">After agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration seized and destroyed their cannabis plants, respondents filed this action to prohibit enforcement of the federal statute to the extent that it prevents them from cultivating marijuana for their personal medical use.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.513" offset="457979">The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that as applied to their activities, the CSA exceeded Congress power under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.085" offset="504268">Because of the obvious importance of the case, we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.081" offset="524225">The case is extremely troublesome because respondents have made such a strong showing that they will suffer irreparable harm if denied the use of marijuana to treat their serious medical illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.436" offset="569678">But the question before us is not whether marijuana does in fact have valid therapeutic purposes, nor whether it is a good policy for the Federal Government to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.436" offset="621714">Rather, the only question before us is whether Congress has the power to prohibit respondents’ activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.748" offset="654942">California law does not really affect our answer to that question for it is well-settled that the outer limits of congressional power under the Commerce Clause are defined exclusively by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.745" offset="706978">The Supremacy Clause unambiguously provides that if there is any conflict between federal and state law, federal law shall prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.122" offset="744385">The federal power can neither be enlarged nor diminished by the exercise or non-exercise of state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.920" offset="779598">Our case law firmly establishes that Congress has the power to regulate purely local activities when necessary to implement a comprehensive national regulatory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.060" offset="828186">Neither the fact that respondents used locally grown marijuana for medicinal rather than recreational purposes, nor the fact that their use for such purposes is permitted by California Law, justifies a constitutionally-compelled exemption from the comprehensive regulatory scheme created by the Controlled Substances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.173" offset="916689">For the reason stated at length in an opinion filed with the Clerk, we therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.606" offset="954410">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice O’Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas have joined except for part three of, and Justice Thomas has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
