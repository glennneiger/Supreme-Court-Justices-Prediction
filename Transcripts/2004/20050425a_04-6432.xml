            <text syncTime="35.720" offset="142838">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="38.764" offset="154958">We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's categorical and jurisdictional prohibition of rule 60(b) in habeas corpus cases absent fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.847" offset="195291">That is a rule that has been rejected by nearly all of the other circuits and, in fact, has been rejected by the United States in its amicus brief filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.363" offset="229355">We urge the Court to adopt instead the approach of the other nine circuits that have commented on this issue, the functional approach, in which a court is deemed to examine each motion individually to determine whether or not the motion comports with both rule 60(b) and AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.269" offset="313051">I think the test we proposed here is a fairly simple one, although I'm not sure in the briefing it comes across as being as simple as it really is, but the test we are proposing, as opposed to the test proposed by the United States, is the one being used in nearly all of the other circuits and it has percolated through the system as one that seems to work very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.894" offset="395494">It's a two-part test and it's very simple I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.328" offset="405211">First, does the motion that's filed challenge the Federal judgment on a ground cognizable under one of the six prongs of rule 60(b)?</text>
            <text syncTime="110.684" offset="442723">If not, if it's really a new claim, if it is not within one of the six prongs of rule 60(b), then simply the district court denies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.081" offset="480235">If, on the other hand, the motion is a true 60(b) motion, as ours was in this case, then the court goes to step two, which is to examine which is the six prongs is implicated, what is the jurisprudence regarding the six... that particular prong, and how would it apply in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.665" offset="558602">That's the functional approach that most of the circuits have been using.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.260" offset="612937">It does not but... but point six has been cabined by jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.350" offset="637388">Although point six appears to be a wide-open door for any motion to be filed and granted, the courts, even before AEDPA, have treated category six as one that requires extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.301" offset="689110">We have been able to quantify.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.969" offset="695798">Both an amicus who filed on behalf of the petitioner and the United States and the respondent have quantified the number of cases that have gone through the rule 60(b) process.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.517" offset="734041">There have only been, since AEDPA was passed, 28 successful motions that we can quantify, that are published in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.789" offset="763089">And we would like to think, at least, that if the State or the Federal Government thought there was an inappropriate application, it would have been raised on appeal and we'd have that statistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.544" offset="794122">28 in the 9-year history of the statute means fewer than 3 per year... or slightly more than 3 per year for the whole country, a fraction for circuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.769" offset="827037">Well, if we were to make clear that 60(b) is widely available, even category six, don't you think... and as a result the AEDPA restrictions don't apply, don't you think that number would increase rather dramatically?</text>

            <text syncTime="224.258" offset="896940">And I do not because at this point apparently nine circuits are following the rule we propose, and so the statistics that both the respondent that we bring to you are that small, are that infinitesimal because the courts have always treated 60(b) as a last ditch, extraordinary circumstances required.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.581" offset="970292">One can go through each of the six prongs and easily hypothesize examples that are appropriate, (b)(1), (b)(2)--</text>

            <text syncTime="266.865" offset="1067363">The first was the Klapprott decision in which the Court recognized that 60(b) is intended to correct the kind of errors that might occur that are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.813" offset="1099233">The Ackermann decision followed a year later and said, however, this is not a wide-open door.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.190" offset="1164748">One cannot ignore a half-century of... of decisions, which have rejected 60(b)(6) and other 60(b)--</text>

            <text syncTime="298.716" offset="1194841">All that is true, but I think that the court below and the other parties say... almost everybody is on your side.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.064" offset="1232248">However, they also note a problem, and the problem is that given the very rigid structure of AEDPA and the imagination of lawyers, that if 60(b) hasn't proved an escape hatch for getting around the AEDPA restriction, it will, and that what the lawyers will do is they will reconstruct what they'd like as a second habeas and put it in the form of a 60(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="334.967" offset="1339768">And so I can accept everything you say, but if that in the back of my mind is a concern running around Congress in this way, what form of words could you put in to restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain in which it's been used so far?</text>
            <text syncTime="352.617" offset="1410403">Now, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation filed a brief in which they tried to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.086" offset="1432242">I thought that was a constructive effort.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.734" offset="1486890">Rhines v. Weber, that the Court delivered just very recently, considered the interaction of a rule and of AEDPA, and I thought it very clearly set forth three principles which work well within the test here.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.982" offset="1535896">First, that there has to be good cause and good cause, of course, is clear in the jurisprudence here, that we're talking about extraordinary circumstances, not a simple legal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.681" offset="1578632">In this case, for example, the extraordinary circumstance is that, for all intents and purposes, my client has been denied his first petition of right because the court foreclosed the issues erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.003" offset="1623980">So good cause is the first thing that I learned from Rhines.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.725" offset="1634847">Secondly, that there have to be potentially meritorious underlying issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.823" offset="1651252">Now, that's going to filter out a lot of the cases because you can't come into court with another issue that might not be good, it mightn't be an unexhausted issue, it might be--</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.126" offset="5032438">Their approach actually can be read, as we did in our reply brief, to fit within our own rule, but I think the problem with the Government's rule is it is so broad and it does not rely upon any of the Court's precedents in... in its writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.321" offset="5093251">And so what you do, if you adopt a rule like that, first of all, is create confusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.711" offset="5254792">So my comment on it is that it may well, if it's read as we did in our reply brief, be the same thing that we're saying and what I refer to as a simple two-step test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.701" offset="6210769">This case presents a fundamental inconsistency to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.151" offset="6228532">Congress said through AEDPA that a habeas petitioner is to take all their claims, put them in one basket, bring them to court within 1 year, and a sovereign State is going to defend that judgment in Federal court one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.398" offset="6285584">Rule 60(b) says, petitioner, use as many baskets as you need, take as long as you like, and the State, you're going to have to keep coming back over and over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.677" offset="6330619">And this case here presents that... that very problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.686" offset="6358727">It isn't that every civil judgment can come back and back again with 60(b) motions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.075" offset="10264242">But with respect to the bright line rule that... that we submit is necessary to effectuate congressional intent, as I was saying, that it's not a perfect system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.296" offset="10313143">And the petitioner can come up with all manner of examples that... that seem to implicate various policy determinations about what should or should not happen in a given situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.350" offset="10349296">But... but our position... and we believe the position of the Eleventh Circuit is... is that Congress has already weighed that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.721" offset="10370821">Congress has already made that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.852" offset="10379389">Congress has already told us where the line is going to be drawn and it's going to be drawn on the side of finality and it's going to be drawn on the side of respect for State sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.713" offset="10414811">And I would... would also submit that... that the Sixth Circuit test and the functional equivalent approach test that's advanced by the petitioner ignores really both the statute and it ignores reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.416" offset="10461623">It ignores the statute because AEDPA tells us you can't revisit an adjudicated habeas petition unless there are certain limited circumstances that are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.375" offset="10497463">And it ignores reality because the only reason to revisit a habeas petition is to ultimately revisit the underlying State court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.626" offset="10534452">And the only purpose for being there is to ultimately get at that State court conviction that is... that is under siege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.412" offset="10557544">With respect to the coexistence, the petitioner made a point about this case is somehow like the Rhines case that was decided recently by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.820" offset="10599236">But in the Rhines case, this Court was balancing the exhaustion requirements with the statute of limitations provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.180" offset="10624627">Here there's nothing to balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.939" offset="10631732">Here this is just simply a prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.879" offset="10639464">Congress says you cannot revisit except in these isolated, limited circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.838" offset="10655347">And so rule 81, habeas rule 11, and this Court's decision in Pitchess all say that 60(b) does not trump if the habeas statute holds differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.082" offset="10700278">And finally, the courts do need a bright line that's not subject to variance, as I mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.773" offset="10719086">This is a workable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.488" offset="10725878">They're familiar with fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.739" offset="10730893">It's well defined in the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.217" offset="10736849">It requires more particularized pleading which makes less room for mischief, and it... it gives the courts an easily identifiable standard by which they can effectuate that congressional policy, that congressional policy of one basket of claims within 1 year and the State will come into this Federal court one time to defend its sovereign judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.871" offset="13279399">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.393" offset="13281489">If I may begin by correcting what I think are two inadvertent mistakes, but important ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.994" offset="13295909">Justice Ginsburg, in answer to your question about the first State habeas, these are... these documents are contained in... in your record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.488" offset="13325897">They're noted at joint appendix 2-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.522" offset="13341989">The first State habeas was dismissed because it was not notarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.631" offset="13358498">That's the sole basis for its dismissal: it was not notarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.266" offset="13373022">The second one was brought and denied, and the court specifically notes, as we note in the yellow brief, footnote 7 on page 12, it set forth the... the court's grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.992" offset="13411892">It says the motion does not state grounds for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.932" offset="13423700">At no point does Florida ever adopt the State's position that either of the petitions was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.071" offset="13448255">The State court addressed them directly on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.714" offset="13458808">Justice Breyer, if I may, I can actually hypothesize several examples under subsection (5), of subsection (4), and perhaps even subsection (2) of rule 60(b), which would be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.511" offset="13501962">For example, under (5), a judgment that should no longer have continuing effect might be that the district court entered an alternative writ of habeas corpus, tried the defendant within 60 days or 90 days, or set him free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.160" offset="13556611">And when everyone gets back to State court, it becomes plainly apparent that can't be done within 60 days, and either the State or the defendant might go back and say, please, amend that order out of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.000" offset="13591928">It's a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.577" offset="13594227">Please amend it to make it 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.560" offset="13602168">We can come up with examples, I think, for each of the provisions, and I think that's really what's interesting about this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.347" offset="13625365">It is written in a way that's durable against AEDPA, and it conforms nicely with AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.146" offset="13652532">And it does not take a lot of extra thought, it does not take a lot more than adopting the Court's previous holdings for us to be able to make it workable within AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.579" offset="13690253">The fact that this case is now in its 25th year is a result of law and not of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.819" offset="13715226">Mr. Gonzalez alleges... and no one has ever been able to say otherwise because we've never had a hearing... that it took him 13 years to find out about the newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.848" offset="13751380">He exhausted his claims for 4 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.917" offset="13759634">He was only in Federal court for 1 year before the State raised a bar, a statute of limitations bar, which turns out to be incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.765" offset="13787011">In the last 7 years, there's been litigation both in the court of appeals and now before this Court caused by the State's argument that the case should have been dismissed on the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.743" offset="13822955">My client is not responsible for the fact that it's the 25th year, but what we do know about this case is he has approximately 76 years remaining on his 99-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.645" offset="13866527">And unless he gets one bite at the habeas apple, he has not gotten what Congress directed he receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.539" offset="13894113">Congress made one thing clear in AEDPA, and I think it's a good thing, and that is, if a defendant goes through and does what he's supposed to do in State court, he does not procedurally default the issues, he exhausts fully, and he timely files a petition, that was the candidate Congress wanted to have to get habeas review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.181" offset="13976660">In this case Aurelio Gonzalez did all of those things, and he sits on the outside, having been told you get no bite at the apple, it's too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.325" offset="14009260">And that's just plain wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.151" offset="14016575">And there's something wrong about that, and that's why there's rule 60(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.741" offset="14034860">60(b) is nothing but a coalescence of many great writs that were designed for one purpose and one purpose alone and that was to correct mistakes in extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.390" offset="14077492">There can be no more extraordinary circumstance than that a person is denied their right to habeas review, and that's what's happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.276" offset="14105078">And we respectfully submit that rule 60(b) is the only and best tool to remedy the error made within the discretion of the district court, and we ask for that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.063" offset="14140186">Thank you.</text>
