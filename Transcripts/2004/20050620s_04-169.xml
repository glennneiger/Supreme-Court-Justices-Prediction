            <text syncTime="8.448" offset="33750">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.377" offset="57469">The False Claims Act prohibits submitting false claims for payment to the US Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.903" offset="87562">It also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who assist the government in investigating or prosecuting false claims actions and gives employees a private cause of action as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.993" offset="147958">The question we decide is whether the six year statute of limitations in the False Claims Act applies to such retaliation actions or whether instead the most closely analogous state statute of limitations applies?</text>
            <text syncTime="54.858" offset="219429">This case began when respondent Karen T. Wilson brought a False Claims Act retaliation action against petitioner, Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District, a political subdivision of the state of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.518" offset="285989">She alleged that County officials retaliated against her for aiding in a federal investigation whether County officials and others had made false claims to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.418" offset="337607">The District Court concluded that Wilson's action was time barred because it was outside the 3-year statute of limitations specified by North Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.717" offset="386821">The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.499" offset="401972">It held that the False Claims Act's longer 6-year statute of limitations governed Wilson's retaliations action rather than the shorter state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.393" offset="485564">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.498" offset="525897">If no federal statute of limitations expressly governs a federal cause of action, we generally borrow the most closely analogous state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.151" offset="580545">We think that no federal statute of limitations expressly governs False Claims Act retaliation actions and therefore hold that the most closely analogous state statute of limitations supplies the time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.698" offset="646792">The only possible federal statute of limitations applicable to retaliation claims is set forth in Section 3731(b)(1) of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.048" offset="700186">It provides that the time limit for filing a cause of action begins to run on the date the defendant submits the false claim for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.054" offset="744176">For reasons we explain in detail in the opinion, we find that this statute's text is ambiguous about whether it governs the retaliations actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.783" offset="799033">We resolve this ambiguity primarily using a rule of statutory construction, the presumption that statues of limitation begin to run when the cause of action arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.608" offset="850338">If section 3731(b)(1) governs retaliations actions, then the limitations period will begin to run before the cause of action arises contrary to our presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.711" offset="906762">By contrast, if we borrow the most closely analogous state limitations period, the time limit will begin when the cause of action accrues in keeping with our presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.829" offset="955246">We therefore conclude that the most closely analogous state limitations period governs False Claims Act retaliations claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.098" offset="996310">Justice Souter joins all of the opinion except for footnote two; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins.</text>
