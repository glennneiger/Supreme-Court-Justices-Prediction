            <label>Ms. Pamela S. Karlan</label>
            <text syncTime="3392.099" offset="13568313">We'd be happier with 10 percent than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.290" offset="13589107">The second point is a point that comes out of this Court's decision last year in the Till case where the Court said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a line that's straightforward and familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.000" offset="13631948">And here's one that I'll give you that comes directly from the text of section 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that section 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans or contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section 403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, which IRA's do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.850" offset="13727347">And this may have led to some of the confusion, I think, between counsel in this case, which is in the Andersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money under section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.595" offset="13778338">It was, instead, under section 403(b), an individual retirement annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.610" offset="13798400">So there are, as far as we know, no individual retirement accounts, the things you put money into while the money accumulates before you're ready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that are customizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.672" offset="13850645">And indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need the protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the unsophisticated people who are putting their money away in an IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist at all or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea that they would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank for a customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.201" offset="13936744">That's why we think the most sensible reading of the statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in them is necessary for the support of the debtor.</text>
