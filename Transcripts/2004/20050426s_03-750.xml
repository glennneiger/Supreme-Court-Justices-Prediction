            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="8.986" offset="35944">This case is about a federal firearm statute that makes it a crime for a person to possess a gun if that person has been convicted in any court, those are they keywords, "in any court, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.808" offset="111177">The legal question before us concerns the scope of the words convicted in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.847" offset="135314">Do those words cover convictions in foreign courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="37.823" offset="151197">The petitioner here for example, Gary Small, was previously convicted of gun smuggling into Japan by a Japanese Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.579" offset="186305">Does the statute forbid him subsequently to possess a gun as it would if for example he would previously been convicted of gun smuggling by a court in Maine?</text>
            <text syncTime="57.933" offset="231654">We answered the question no.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.460" offset="241789">We think the words any court do not include foreign courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.011" offset="259971">For one thing, the statutory word "any", though it is certainly a broad word, does not answer the question by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.111" offset="296438">If I say I will go to a film playing at any theater this evening, I am not talking about theaters in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.971" offset="327784">We have to look to context to find out the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.860" offset="343353">Or another thing, when reading ambiguous statutes, we often start with the common sense notion that Congress legislates with domestic concerns in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.583" offset="390269">That notion cannot decide this case for the gun possession here is domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.316" offset="413257">Small was prosecuted for possessing a gun in the United States but it does argue in favor of the view that Congress thought that the preceding triggering crime would be domestic as well, and that view is further supported by the fact that foreign countries may have criminal laws that are very different from our own substantively different think of economic crimes in the former Soviet Union procedurally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.113" offset="528405">Think of systems that downgrade the significance of testimony if it is given by a woman or different in punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.207" offset="560797">Think of systems that punish severely conduct that we would treat as simply minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.406" offset="585561">To import all such convictions into this statute would leave judges with a difficult case by case task of distinguishing among different foreign laws and leave some Americans, say recent immigrants from some of those countries, uncertain as to whether they could or could not buy guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.123" offset="668421">We consequently begin with a domestic only assumption, but we use this assumption simply as a kind of tiebreaker if congressional intent in the matter is difficult to discern.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.723" offset="726831">Finally, we have gone through all the other indications and we cannot get one place to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.998" offset="747938">We do not find anything that tells us what Congress really intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.973" offset="763820">The language of the statute says nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.759" offset="775001">Indeed, if we were to apply that statute to foreign convictions, it would produce, because of the language, a number of anomalies that otherwise would be absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.727" offset="814811">The legislative history of the statute tells us nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.127" offset="828500">It is silent on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.390" offset="837486">Now, the purpose of the statute keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous persons does tell us a little.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.534" offset="866116">Indeed, it argues against our conclusion but it tells us too little.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.473" offset="889835">That is because the government says that in the nearly 40 years this statute has been on the books, there have been no more than 10 to a dozen cases involving convictions entered in foreign courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.679" offset="942707">So, applying the statute to domestic only convictions cannot make much practical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.931" offset="967680">We conclude, using our tiebreaker, that in all likelihood, Congress simply did not think about the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.754" offset="998922">So, with the tiebreaker, we decide against foreign application of the phrase "any court", though Congress of course remains free to amend the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.581" offset="1038315">For these and other reasons discussed in the opinion, we reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit and we remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.335" offset="1073319">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.182" offset="1100696">The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.</text>
