            <text syncTime="3214.364" offset="12857365">In petitioner's view, those agreements don't even give rise to an assignment of income in the ordinary sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.597" offset="12882338">If you look at the text of the fee agreement in the Banaitis case... the Banks' fee agreement is not in the record... among other things, it makes clear that if there is a termination... and it provides lots of grounds on which the attorney-client relationship can be terminated... that the attorney will be paid a reasonable fee, calculated at the sum of $175 per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.548" offset="12974184">That doesn't sound like an assignment of any income or even an assignment of the underlying cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.236" offset="13000934">Even if it did, it is clear that in every assignment of income case, the assignor loses control over that income that he assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.492" offset="13033953">That doesn't stop the application of the proper tax principles, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.457" offset="13049731">The... the respondents in these cases suffered a legally cognizable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.523" offset="13074077">They had a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.638" offset="13078465">That claim entitled them to a recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.200" offset="13088705">They retained services to pursued that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.800" offset="13099154">If they had paid their lawyers on an hourly basis, those lawyers may have been just as necessary to the actual outcome of the case as their contingent fee attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.634" offset="13134472">Both the... an hourly fee attorney and a contingent fee attorney in both of the States at issue here... and in fact, in all States of which I'm aware... received precisely the same attorney's lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.498" offset="13173969">That lien makes clear that the relationship between attorney and client starts out as that between a master and an agent and then is converted through the fee agreement to that between a creditor and a debtor, and the lien secures the debt and ensures its payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.102" offset="13236349">When the proceeds from the litigation are paid to the attorney, it satisfies the respondent's debt and is therefore income to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.935" offset="13271667">Under the separate and alternative ground of this Court's Old Colony decision, it goes far and beyond even the holding with regard to an assignment of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.595" offset="13310328">To address just a couple of questions that came up, I would point out that in the class action context, again, as I indicated, there are a number of differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.140" offset="13344496">And just to be a little more specific about some of them, generally speaking there's no unilateral right to settle a... a case by class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.993" offset="13371873">There's no unilateral right to dismiss the case, and there's no right to a determined fee.</text>
