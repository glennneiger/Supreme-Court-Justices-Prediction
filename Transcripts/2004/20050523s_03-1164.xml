            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="10.458" offset="41796">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.050" offset="64157">It involves a challenge to the Federal Program of generic advertising for beef, popularly known as the "Beef, It's What's for Dinner" campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.998" offset="107938">Pursuant to a federal statute, the United States Department of Agriculture imposes a $1 per head assessment or a checkoff on all cattle sold in or imported to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.933" offset="163631">The money is used to fund a number of beef related activities including research, consumer education, and the marketing programs at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.870" offset="203442">The Cattlemen’s Beef Promotion and Research Board, an entity whose members are nominated by state beef councils and appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, proposes the marketing campaigns which the Agriculture Department itself vets and approves.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.304" offset="277211">Many of the advertisements funded by the checkoff contain a tag line stating that they are “funded by America’s beef producers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="79.312" offset="317231">The respondents here are several cattlemen who paid the checkoff and two organizations whose members pay the check off.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.140" offset="352549">They object to being compelled to fund the beef advertising for various reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.373" offset="373447">For example, some of them complained that the ads promote beef in general rather than their own particular specialty such as grain-fed beef or certified Angus beef.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.350" offset="417332">The District Court agreed with the respondent’s contention that the ads violate the First Amendment by forcing beef producers to pay for speech with which they disagree, and it held unenforceable, the statute and the regulations creating the beef board and imposing the check off.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.779" offset="487027">The Court of Appeals affirmed that order and the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.850" offset="503327">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that the First Amendment does not facially invalidate the checkoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.468" offset="541780">Prior cases decided by this Court have held unconstitutional compelled subsidies and speech, including a federally mandated checkoff similar to the one here which funded generic advertising for mushrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.630" offset="602488">Each of these cases was decided, however, on the understanding that the plaintiffs were being forced to subsidize private speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.768" offset="634984">We have consistently respected the principle that compelled support of government is fundamentally different from compelled support of a private association.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.434" offset="677721">As every taxpayer knows, all governments fund their operations including operations that involve speech by the government through compulsory exaction even when their citizens object to the programs for which the tax is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.274" offset="737071">The respondents contend that the beef advertisements are not the usual form of government speech because they are designed by the Beef Board and its operating committee, some of whose member are appointed by a private organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.675" offset="790674">We think this distinction is not persuasive because the Federal Government exercises effective control over the content.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.732" offset="822857">Congress has specified the general message, federal statutes and regulations set out specific elements and officials of the Agriculture Department exercise approval authority over every word used in every promotional campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.159" offset="884611">The First Amendment analysis is not changed by the fact that this government speech is funded through a targeted assessment on cattle sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.416" offset="921600">Citizens have no First Amendment right to resist funding government speech whether the government garners the funds through general taxes or through more narrowly focused assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.473" offset="965799">Although the targeted assessment means that the ads are, as the tagline states, funded by America’s beef producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.223" offset="996833">Respondents have not presented any evidence that this attribution would cause people who view the ads to think that the message is actually endorsed by particular beef producers such as the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.585" offset="1050331">We, therefore, do not consider whether the beef advertisements violate the First Amendment by effectively speaking in respondent’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.004" offset="1083977">We conclude only that the beef checkoff is not facially invalid under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.073" offset="1108219">The respondent’s complaint included several other grounds for challenging the checkoff program which the lower courts have not yet considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.049" offset="1136118">Respondents may now proceed on these other claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.247" offset="1148970">For these reasons and others stated in our opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Eight Circuit and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.152" offset="1184601">Justices Thomas and Breyer have filed concurring opinions; Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion, and Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens and Kennedy have joined.</text>
