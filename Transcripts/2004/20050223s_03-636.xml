          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="5.241" stopTime="192.246">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="5.241" offset="20898">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.006" offset="40020">The California Department of Corrections has an unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells in reception centers for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.785" offset="99056">During that time, prison officials evaluate inmates to determine their ultimate placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.151" offset="124552">The claim is that this system of segregation is necessary to prevent violence caused by racial gangs.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.490" offset="157884">The petitioner in this case, Garrison Johnson, is an African-American inmate in the California Correctional System.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.298" offset="189127">He has been incarcerated since 1987 in a number of prison facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.702" offset="210756">Upon his arrival at each facility, Johnson has been double-celled with another African-American inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.583" offset="238237">Johnson filed suit alleging that California’s policy violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment by assigning him cellmates on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.899" offset="287556">The District Court granted summary judgment for the State and the Ninth Circuit affirmed under the deferential standard of review which we adopted in Turner versus Safley for prison administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.808" offset="343144">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.605" offset="370416">We hold that strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for Johnson’s constitutional challenge to California’s policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.970" offset="403853">We have held repeatedly that all racial classifications imposed by the government must be analyzed by reviewing court under so-called strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.354" offset="449411">Under that test, the government has the burden of proving that racial classifications are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.868" offset="491416">We insist on strict scrutiny because racial classifications raise special fears of motivation by invidious purpose, and strict scrutiny enables courts to smoke out any illegitimate uses of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.060" offset="552229">The more deferential standard of review articulated in Turner versus Safley is too lenient for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.527" offset="594024">We do not decide the constitutionality of California’s policy today.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.089" offset="612310">We remand for the lower courts to decide that question after applying the proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.762" offset="638955">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Thomas has also filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Scalia has joined; Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion joined by Justices Souter and Breyer.</text>
