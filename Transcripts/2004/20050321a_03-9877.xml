            <text syncTime="54.142" offset="216503">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.812" offset="231236">When the government acts to remove government-imposed burdens on religious exercise, it does not violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.129" offset="260493">Rather, as this Court put the point in Zorach against Clauson, when the government eases those kind of burdens, it follows the best of our traditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.068" offset="296229">The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA, eases government burdens on restrictions by having institutions and prison officials examine burdens on religious exercise and remove unjustified, substantial burdens.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="90.041" offset="360072">But, you know, when you say it eases burdens, it doesn't just ease burdens imposed by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.604" offset="390374">It eases burdens imposed by State governments.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="101.721" stopTime="174.229">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="101.721" offset="406883">That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that... that that doesn't make any substantial difference, in part, I think because if you think about certainly this application of RLUIPA, it's Spending Clause legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.870" offset="455471">And spending legislation often takes the form of giving the States an incentive to take action on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.668" offset="478668">And in this sense, I think you can understand this legislation as giving the States an opportunity to remove their own burdens on religious exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.620" offset="510433">And that's precisely how it works in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.865" offset="519419">The relevant action that a State takes is State action removing its own burdens, not Federal action imposed on the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.782" offset="547109">And I think that's consistent with the analysis of this Court in the Dole case where the Federal Government, on the assumption of this Court, didn't have the direct power under the 21st Amendment to raise the drinking age, but it could give the option to the States to exercise their power to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.074" offset="604264">So I do think in the end, the burdens that are removed here are attributable to the State of Ohio, not to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.356" offset="629342">It is also true that the standard that's imposed by RLUIPA is a more exacting standard than that imposed by the Federal Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.718" offset="662779">But I don't think providing for greater accommodation of religious exercise than the Federal Constitution creates an Establishment Clause problem.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="174.229" offset="696842">But in... in the City of Boerne, didn't we say that Congress couldn't come in and simply rewrite some part of the Constitution to make it read differently than we had?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="184.650" stopTime="217.396">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="184.650" offset="738534">Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't think this case poses the same problems as City of Boerne.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.793" offset="763089">First of all, this really isn't an effort to rewrite a rule of decision for all cases the way that RFRA was.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.831" offset="787226">Congress in this legislation targeted two areas where there were particular problems with respect to religious exercise, and in those contexts, it addressed a different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.739" offset="826932">Now, as I say, that standard is higher, but so are the standards of over half of the States which also apply a heightened scrutiny test either as a matter of State constitutional law or State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.603" offset="922331">I... that seems to me the principal difference between this and RFRA.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.275" offset="945006">I would... I would clarify that there is the potential for applications to the statute under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.048" offset="964127">We don't think that's really appropriately presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.661" offset="974576">We also think that with respect to State prisons in all their applications, they will be Spending Clause applications.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="249.730" offset="998818">Is that... what you're saying is academic because the statute doesn't require a Federal spending hook.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.956" offset="1027762">It says it has the other commerce peg.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.772" offset="1039047">I take it you... you gave a pragmatic answer to that, that every State in fact gets Federal funds for their prison systems.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="267.313" offset="1069244">That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the fact that there may be more than one hook for this legislation in certain applications shouldn't make any constitutional difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.712" offset="1110831">And I think here it is Spending Clause legislation as it applies to the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.192" offset="1128699">I think that's conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.377" offset="1133505">They... they take issue with whether it's valid.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="284.870" offset="1139461">But, Mr. Clement, it seems to me the Spending Clause aspect cuts in the other direction, if we're just focusing on the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.778" offset="1171017">The fact that Federal money is involved, why does that make your burden any less in defending the... the statute under the Establishment Clause?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="301.066" stopTime="331.071">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="301.066" offset="1204245">Well, Justice Stevens, I don't think the fact that there's money involved makes it harder or easier from a Spending Clause perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.476" offset="1229845">I think from the perspective of why this case is different from Boerne, the fact that it's Spending Clause and Commerce Clause and not section 5 legislation makes a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.084" offset="1264327">But I certainly don't want to leave you with the impression that there's anything constitutionally problematic because there's Federal money involved because, of course, this Court has upheld Federal Spending Clause legislation in religion areas in cases like Zobrest, Mergens, Agostini, Mitchell against Helms.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="331.071" stopTime="341.513">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="331.071" offset="1324199">Do you... do you think the Establishment Clause issue in this case would be the same as the Establishment Clause issue in City of Boerne if we... if the Court had reached the Establishment Clause issue in that case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="341.513" stopTime="368.796">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="341.513" offset="1365995">No, I don't, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.572" offset="1374250">Or another way of answering that is I would say that even though you thought there was an Establishment Clause problem in the City of Boerne case, I don't think you need to find one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.006" offset="1403925">And part of that is because this is more targeted legislation, and it particularly deals, as... as it comes to this Court in this application, with the exercise of religion in prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.085" offset="1444258">And I think that's an area like the military where the Government is necessarily going to be involved with religion in a way that it otherwise wouldn't be.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.465" offset="1521789">If you can find some religious group that espouses drinking beer every day or other alcoholic beverages or taking certain amounts of marijuana or no telling what or having certain clothing or other things that would alter the conditions of the prison environment, there's a real incentive here to get religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.415" offset="1673613">First of all, this is not an absolute entitlement to get your religious beer at 5:00 p.m. every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.062" offset="1696183">It is a balancing test, and I think things like getting beer every day, getting marijuana inside prison walls would not satisfy the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.640" offset="1726485">Well, the... the language of the statute is pretty strong: unless the government demonstrates that the imposition is the least restrictive means and in furtherance of a compelling legislative interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.690" offset="1786671">It puts quite a burden on the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.901" offset="1863576">I would think, a fortiori, it would be justified within prison walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.372" offset="1877473">I want to make another point about the incentives, though, which I think is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.459" offset="1889802">Every State in the Union provides some degree of accommodation for religion, and in many States it's majoritarian religions that are accommodated.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.038" offset="1920104">Now, if there's going be some incentive to engage in religiosity in prison in order to take advantage of things offered for religion that aren't available for something else, at least RLUIPA has the virtue of making sure that all religions are accommodated neutrally.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.230" offset="1976842">So if there's any incentive, it's an incentive for religion over irreligion as opposed to between sects... sects of religions, and I think that's the way you would have without RLUIPA involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.811" offset="2019161">The other point I want to make is although there may be some extravagant claims of certain religions that would seem quite enticing, much religious exercise in many of the reported cases involve things that I don't think people are necessarily lining up to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.366" offset="2069420">I mean, there are a number of lower court cases dealing with the availability of kosher food, and in prison what that means as a practical matter, is generally you are going to get cold food rather than hot food.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.950" offset="2319778">Ohio, I take it, takes the position that if you have a medallion that could be used for those purposes, you can't have it within prison walls at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.798" offset="2347154">The Bureau of Prisons, by contrast, takes the position that you can have the medallion, but you have to wear it inside your shirt.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.525" offset="3074090">This Court has been quite clear that there is not a constitutional problem in favoring religion over irreligion in providing legislative accommodations for religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.285" offset="3153084">The Court made basically the same point in Smith in saying that even though the Free Exercise Clause did not require the special accommodation or exemption for peyote, the legislatures could do so and in doing so, they would be furthering constitutional values.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.510" offset="3357989">And we would urge the same course here because, although the courts have divided on this Establishment Clause issue, the courts have not divided on the Spending Clause issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.866" offset="3391425">All the courts that have reached it have upheld it as valid Spending Clause legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.219" offset="3408875">And I think that reflects the fact that there is a clear nexus here between the Federal funds and the Federal conditions that are being imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.392" offset="3437505">If the Federal Government is going to provide money, over $1 million to Ohio, to have prisoner meals, then certainly the Federal Government can insist that kosher meals are among the available options.</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.311" offset="4133198">This Court has made... asked many questions about the accommodation of religion, and the suggestion is, well, isn't there favoritism?</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.063" offset="4176248">But the answer to each of those questions is the same with respect to the current accommodations already provided by the Ohio Department of Corrections with respect to mainstream religions, and in fact, we believe on remand, we will be able to show that there is a preference for accommodating mainstream religions as opposed to non-mainstream religions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.638" offset="14154501">I do want to make the point, though, that... that Ohio already, under its State constitution, has this heightened review with a lot of these, you know, least restrictive alternative tests and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.764" offset="14190968">Nobody thinks Ohio's constitution violates the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.945" offset="14207687">That's true even though Ohio applies it in the prison context, at least when it's a claim by a guard rather than an inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.588" offset="14230256">That... those are the facts of Humphrey against Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.513" offset="14237989">It's also true that many of Ohio's arguments would suggest their own accommodations of some religions give too much of an incentive for religious exercise and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.406" offset="14277590">And I think that's a defect as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.278" offset="14285009">I don't think... and I agree with Justice Souter in this regard... that narrower accommodations actually raise more constitutional problems than broader accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.120" offset="14320431">I think that this Court, for example, in Caldor dealt with an accommodation that was at a fairly high level of generality, but yet this Court said and Justice O'Connor emphasized in her concurrence, well, that's a preference for Sabbatarian religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.635" offset="14366511">And I think you avoid that with this kind of across-the-board test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.963" offset="14379781">Justice Kennedy, you made a point about whether this is extreme in the degree that it accommodates religion, but it's certainly no more extreme than the... than the laws and constitutions of 26 States, which across the board apply this heightened scrutiny to all manner of State actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.598" offset="14438296">So in that sense, the fact that it accommodates religion kind of wholesale with a broader standard, as opposed to retail, I don't think is a constitutional defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.464" offset="14469851">The last point I wanted to make is on the racist literature hypothetical, and I think it is in large measure just a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.340" offset="14493257">As footnote 2 in our brief points out, prisons have been generally successful in keeping racist literature out even when it's supported as a claim for religious-based racist literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.504" offset="14534008">The only cases that I've come across where that hasn't prevailed is when the... the prison's own policy had exceptions in it that made very little sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.022" offset="14568072">And in this case, for example, if you look at joint appendix page 118, there's an allegation that with... with one piece of literature that was described as racist, that some prisoners were allowed to have it while others were not allowed to have that same kind of literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.526" offset="14622093">Now, I don't know whether those claims are in fact true, but that's the kind of claim that should be able to go forward in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.200" offset="14644767">With all respect, I think the Sixth Circuit here made a mistake, ignored this Court's precedents, and should be reversed.</text>
