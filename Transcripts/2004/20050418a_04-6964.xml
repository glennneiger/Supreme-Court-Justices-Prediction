            <text syncTime="74.462" offset="297796">One, the correct prima facie standard under Batson is whether there's sufficient evidence to permit a judge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.684" offset="334681">Two, the challenger's own reasons must be disclosed in order for the Batson process to work and to prevent discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.966" offset="367804">Three, it is improper for a third party to speculate at the prima facie stage as to a challenger's possible reason because what needs to be evaluated is the challenger's own reason and own credibility and own demeanor, and not someone else's guess as a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.529" offset="438021">The correct prima facie test is a permissive inference test where there is sufficient evidence to allow a judge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.142" offset="480549">That's equivalent to the test where a judge decides whether there's sufficient evidence to pass a case to the jury, although I'd like to add one small proviso to that, which is in case of doubt, the benefit should go in the direction of obtaining the reason because the goals of Batson cannot properly be enforced unless the reason for the challenge... the challenge is stated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.562" offset="13206152">Here the prosecutor perempted all three black jurors and left a black defendant to be tried by an all-white jury in a racially tinged case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.528" offset="13258083">These facts indisputably present an inference of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.543" offset="13274070">The... my opponent suggests that silence may be a strategic decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.509" offset="13301969">But we have yet to locate any... any case where any prosecutor anywhere in a situation remotely like this has chosen silence as the proper strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.036" offset="13344078">The purpose of Batson is... is to elicit reasons from the prosecutor and then for the trial court to evaluate those reasons and determine whether or not, looking at the... all the circumstances and the prosecutor's credibility and the type of case, whether or not their challenge is race-based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.242" offset="13420878">Reasons are crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.848" offset="13427357">In the appendix to our opening brief, we examined 84 cases in the last couple years where discrimination was found in violation of Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.837" offset="13459331">In virtually all of these cases, the decision turned on the evaluation of the articulated reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.328" offset="13485244">In some of those, the articulated reason was unsupported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.410" offset="13505620">From that, there was an inference and a finding of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.989" offset="13519935">In others of those, the articulated reason applied to many white jurors who were not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.191" offset="13544699">All those facts existed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.672" offset="13554625">The goals of Batson, which are admirable and important, which should apply in all 50 States, not just in 48, require... need the reasons to be elicited because Batson won't work unless reasons are known and examined and ruled on on the merits and a record is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.823" offset="13631216">We'd ask this Court to bring California into the mainstream and ask that reasons be called for in California under the same standard that they're called for everywhere else.</text>
