            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="62.551" offset="250149">Would the Government be without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="68.068" offset="272196">--I believe that's true, Justice O'Connor, because the espionage agents do not sign prepublication review agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.104" offset="296333">They do not receive formal security clearances the way that an employee does.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.032" offset="312111">And unlike an employee, they do not have access to a broad swath of classified information that raises attendant counterintelligence concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.838" offset="343249">And so if you think about the course of dealing that the agency has with its employees, the employees are able to sue the agency in court under, for example, title VII, and the agency can turn around and sue their employees to enforce things like the prepublication review agreement that was issue... at issue in this Court's Snepp decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.478" offset="417855">So in the employment context, I think it's very difficult to say that there's an implied term of the employment contract that either side will not have judicial recourse.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.479" offset="529868">And I think that... that is illustrated by this Court's decision in Totten.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.213" offset="544810">I mean, William Lloyd, for example, was a U.S. citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.348" offset="557349">He agreed with President Lincoln to engage in espionage activities in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.798" offset="575112">And this Court held that when the estate of... of Mr. Lloyd came to seek compensation from a court, that there was no judicial remedy to enforce that alleged agreement, and the remedy, if any, lay with the President's contingent fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.493" offset="637910">Your interpretation of Totten... does it say that there is just no actionable contract, or does it say there's no jurisdictions like political question?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.377" offset="953469">--Justice Kennedy, I think the general practice of the Government is to file under both.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.205" offset="968725">I believe that's what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.900" offset="975517">I think the fact that we file under both suggests that there is a little bit of confusion about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.057" offset="992131">I would tend to agree with you it's better understood as a rule of dismissal under 12(b)(6) because if you think about the Totten decision, there's really two strains to the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.183" offset="1028702">One is a recognition that the claim to relief necessarily depends on a fact that the law has always regarded as secret, and in a sense that case simply can't proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.651" offset="1070602">And that's very analogous to this Court's holding in Weinberger against Catholic Action.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.831" offset="1087321">There's a second strain to the case, though, and that is that the very idea of walking into court and filing the action is inconsistent with an implied term of the contract or, indeed, the whole nature of the espionage relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.102" offset="1144372">And I think particularly if you emphasize that second strain of the Totten decision, I think it's better understood as a 12(b)(6) dismissal because what you're really saying is somebody is walking into court and they are effectively pleading themselves out of court because as... if you look at this complaint here, it starts out with a recitation of the fact that these individuals allegedly engaged in espionage activities and that they were denied certain promises that were made to them after they carried out, quote, their end of the bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.771" offset="1335066">It's a contract that the law just doesn't recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.253" offset="1344993">And I think that... that reflects the underlying reality of these cases, which is there is something inherent in an espionage relationship that when you enter an espionage relationship, you understand that you have no protected status under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.718" offset="1406851">I think that has, with respect, been clear in the... not just in the Totten decision but from the very beginning of the republic.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.485" offset="2149878">And I suppose that if the agency completely changed its course of dealing with respect to its employees or entered a very different course of dealing with certain select employees, then a Totten defense might become available in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.354" offset="2205362">But as I indicated earlier, I think if you look at the overall nature of the agency's relationship and rights vis-a-vis its employees, even its covert ones, that's a very different relationship than the agency has with respect to espionage agents.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="663.329" offset="2653309">Justice Ginsburg, I think the answer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in the pure sense and so if this Court disagreed with our view that there wasn't a Tucker Act problem, this Court could reach that issue and send the case back on the Tucker Act grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.524" offset="2710047">So maybe I could explain to you why it is that we think that there's not a Tucker Act problem, at least at this stage of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.808" offset="2735229">The Ninth Circuit's reasoning on this was a little bit oblique, but as I understand it, there were two parts to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.076" offset="2756232">First of all, that there might be some kind of substantive due process claim here that did not depend on the contract but rather somehow stemmed from the fact that there was some endangerment of these individuals and that gave rise to some substantive due process right.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.079" offset="2816313">And even if that claim, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, is not one that is formed on the contract or an implied contract, it seems to me that that's a claim that's clearly within the coverage of the Totten doctrine because it is inherent in the espionage relationship that the individual will be engaged in a... in a situation where they will be endangered.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.196" offset="2896771">And I think that was certainly true of William Lloyd in the Totten case.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.303" offset="2909205">When he crossed southern lines, he was very much endangered, and that's something that wasn't lost on President Lincoln.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.354" offset="2929371">In footnote 3 of our opening brief, we have a quotation from President Lincoln about the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the need for secrecy to protect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.816" offset="2967197">So that's why I think that claim is properly understood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not being required to be brought in the Court of Claims, but nonetheless a claim that is barred by the Totten doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.244" offset="3016934">The other point they made was with respect to the specific regulations that the agency has internally, and they suggest that there might be a claim here that was based on the regulations independent of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.132" offset="3064477">But in order for that claim to go forward, the Court would have to examine the unredacted version of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.385" offset="3089450">And even if the Court is right that there's a need for further proceedings on that question, it makes no sense to interpret the doctrine in a way that requires the Government to wait to assert a Totten defense until there is a jurisdictional question cleared up that actually requires discovery because I think what Totten recognized is... is there is a need to dismiss the claim at the outset before any discovery because of the nature of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.063" offset="3188193">So for those two reasons, we thought that the... that the better view was that the Tucker Act problem was either not presented because of the substantive due process claim or not ripe and that we would pursue the Totten act.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="807.746" stopTime="853.460">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="807.746" offset="3230929">That... that would make a lot of sense if you really felt that what Totten is is... is a dismissal on the merits, just saying there's... there's no contractual claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.749" offset="3270949">I... I mean, if you didn't believe that, if... if you believed that what Totten says is we have no jurisdiction, then we'd have no problem and we could resolve all of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.223" offset="3312849">But it seems to me if you believe that Totten is based mainly... you know, it's a contract case and said the contract is just totally invalid, we shouldn't be reaching the contract issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.436" offset="3353704">We should simply say that if... if we agree with you, that there's no substantive due process claim here and... and no claim based on the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.220" offset="3464777">And I think it would be particularly perplexing to have a doctrine that said that when we have a suit that we know on the face of the complaint cannot be brought in any court, that we are going to not reach that issue in favor of trying to determine first which court it properly belongs in, when that inquiry in fact will get us into the exact classified information that we know at the outset the suit should not involve in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.438" offset="3561744">And I think there is enough flexibility in this Court's Rohrgas decision to allow the Court to reach that threshold question first.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.304" offset="3641156">I think one of the difficulties with the constitutional theory that's advanced on the other side is it gives... it seeks a right to enforce internal procedural handling mechanisms for claims that we know there's no legitimate expectation for their enforcement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.677" offset="3702700">And it seems odd that this would develop in a way where the procedural rights somehow trump the substantive rights, and we know from Totten that there is no substance here that can be brought forward in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.130" offset="3744496">I think in this respect it is also important to recognize that, as a practical matter, an agent who's negotiating in the shadow of the Totten decision and the broader understanding that Totten reflects is likely to seek assurances not just about compensation but about how... how their claims would be heard by the CIA and how they're going to get their compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.471" offset="3821819">And I think there's no particular reason to think procedural assurances should be judicially enforceable when the substantive assurances are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.801" offset="3851180">Now, one other point to make about the nature of these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.090" offset="3864346">Not only because of the nature of these agreements does the agency end up in a position where it cannot enforce these contracts itself through judicial actions, but it also ends up in a situation where it may have to give up-front payments that it otherwise wouldn't have to give and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.679" offset="3930697">So there are consequences to both sides of dealing in this way with these espionage relationships as effectively outside the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.001" offset="3959954">But again, it has always been thus, and I think there is no principle in... in any recent development that requires this Court to revisit the rule of Totten which, as I said, suggests an... it reflects an understanding that date backs... dates back much further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.970" offset="4011781">If I can make one other point, which is I think even though the Totten decision reflects something more than the state secrets privilege, because there's a more fundamental defect with a suit that's premised on an espionage agreement than just the fact that it tends to compromise secret information, it is true that applying the Totten rule of dismissal does provide a clear mechanism that protects confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.753" offset="4110942">And I would analogize it to this Court's decision in Snepp where the Court adopted a constructive trust arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.529" offset="4138109">The Court adopted that arrangement where... where an employee who violated a... a prepublication review agreement had to turn over all the proceeds to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.388" offset="4173531">And... and the Court adopted that remedy in favor of a damages remedy, and the Court did so to send a clear signal to the employees that there is no incentive whatsoever to violate the terms of these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.139" offset="4216477">In the same way, having a clear rule of dismissal sends a clear message to espionage agents that there's no point in even bothering to file the suit in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.668" offset="4250645">It will simply be dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.603" offset="4838400">One, as this Court recognized in Reynolds... in the Reynolds state secrets context itself, even the provisions of going forward, no matter what innovations have been made, the... the provisions of going forward and handling classified information necessarily involve risks that the information will be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.944" offset="4903706">In the first place, both Totten and the state secrets privilege itself are premised on the notion that the information, if it is in fact privileged, is withheld from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.976" offset="4943830">It's an absolute privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.121" offset="4948428">So the idea is not that you have some sort of limited disclosure to the court personnel and to the ultimate fact-finder in the case and that's somehow all consistent with the state secrets privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.173" offset="5732624">So unless one can allege that they were a party to a secret contract or at least a secret relationship, there's no point in that individual even being in a position... they wouldn't even have standing to challenge the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.176" offset="5924676">Alleged spies would have rights under those regulations, and the very idea of walking into court and asserting your rights as an alleged spy is inconsistent with the entire relationship and the contract that gave rise to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.634" offset="5974518">I would also point you to the Weinberger decision, Weinberger against Catholic Action, because there this Court applied Totten to not force the Navy to produce an environmental impact statement even though there were regulations on the book... and the concurring Justices focused on those regulations... where the Department of Defense said we do produce an environmental impact statement even if it's classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.754" offset="6058945">So I think on the authority of Weinberger as well, the very fact that there are internal regulations on a subject, the entire subject matter of which is secret, doesn't give rise to judicially enforceable rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.756" offset="12118936">Thank you, Mr. Burman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.806" offset="12123220">Mr. Clement, you have about 4 and a half minutes if you need them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3038.669" offset="12154671">Justice Stevens, just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.269" offset="12161045">And may it please the Court, just a few points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.436" offset="12169718">First of all, as I think Justice Kennedy's question indicated, there was no waiver of any due process argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.426" offset="12189675">If you look at those footnotes, the only thing that's waived is the Tucker Act concern that we talked about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.497" offset="12209946">Second of all, I think in thinking about this PL-110 claim, it's important to acknowledge, as I think Justice Scalia was suggesting, that it is the PL-110 claim to the CIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.955" offset="12255817">And as I understand their argument, it depends on their being a significant difference between coming into court and saying I'm an unacknowledged spy and I'd like to sue the CIA and coming into court and saying I am an unacknowledged PL-110 resettlee with a claim against the CIA, please hear my claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.037" offset="12328124">I would say there's no material difference in terms of all of the policies that undergird the Totten doctrine between those two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.787" offset="12355082">And I would note that even the Ninth Circuit recognized at 35a and 37a of the petition appendix that the respondents would have to establish a relationship with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.457" offset="12393744">The final two points I would make is, first of all, they would like to make some benefit of the fact that they are suing as Does as opposed to the Totten case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.462" offset="12425822">I would make two points about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.362" offset="12433345">First of all, presumably the reason that William Lloyd could use his name in the Totten case is because it was a suit by his estate and he was deceased, so he didn't have a concern about retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.385" offset="12473469">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.133" offset="12476500">I would also say that the difference between suing under Doe and suing under your name just makes clear that both sides to this litigation start with the premise that the fundamental fact of this litigation turns on a secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.611" offset="12522371">They don't want their name revealed any more than we want the name revealed, and that just underscores how this is all about a secret, just as in Totten.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.357" offset="12553404">The last point I would make is they asked you to take their pleadings as a given at this stage in the litigation, and I would ask you to look at those pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.887" offset="12583497">The complaint is replete with references to the espionage relationship, and the complaint itself cites Totten or the Totten doctrine no less than seven times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.828" offset="12619233">I would suggest that if this claim is not Totten-barred, then no claim is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.735" offset="12634906">With that, I'd ask the court below be reversed.</text>
