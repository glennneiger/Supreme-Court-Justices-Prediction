            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="8.831" offset="35318">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.604" offset="46393">The Government concedes that the destruction of documents in anticipation of a proceeding was not a crime in the fall of 2001 based upon a statutory rule that Congress had preserved for over a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.322" offset="109192">The central question in this case is whether Congress, nevertheless, intended to make a polite request to engage in that lawful conduct, a form of witness tampering punishable by ten years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.095" offset="168333">We ask this Court to reject that interpretation of the statute and to hold that Arthur Andersen did not commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.410" offset="201561">I'd like to turn first to the term 1512 and explain why Arthur Andersen's interpretation represents not only a reasonable reading, but the best reading of the language in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.018" offset="268016">The first thing that we see when we look at the statutory context is that Congress did not prohibit... did not prohibit... all persuasion to destroy documents for the specific purpose of making them unavailable for use in an official proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.281" offset="345025">It did not, because it did not simply say,</text>
            <text syncTime="89.706" offset="358818">"Anyone who persuades a witness to do this has violated the statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="94.602" offset="378358">It added a very important limitation, and that is the word "corruptly"... "corruptly persuades".</text>
            <text syncTime="100.373" offset="401450">So what kinds of requests are excluded from the definition?</text>
            <text syncTime="106.735" offset="426841">When is it that it's okay to persuade someone to destroy a document for use in an official proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.314" offset="449202">And the answer, we think, based on the traditional meaning of the term "corruptly", is that "corruptly" means that you have persuaded someone in a fashion that uses improper means, such as bribery, or you've asked the witness to violate duties imposed by other law, whether that's the duties imposed by contempt or the duties imposed by a whole range of statutes that govern the obligations of people in our society.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.444" offset="785763">--Well, in that case, if the witness knows that you have committed a crime, and you are asking them to violate, they have a duty, under those circumstances, not to assist you in concealing your offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.581" offset="830276">That's a duty that's imposed by criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.965" offset="839784">So if you ask them to violate that duty, then you are corrupting that witness; and, very definitely, that would fall within the interpretation of the statute that Arthur Andersen is advancing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.919" offset="883670">And it fits, Your Honor, with what Congress really did for a hundred years before 2002.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.252" offset="904986">What it did is, it said that... under the Pettibone rule, that it is not a crime to simply destroy documents in anticipation of a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.935" offset="939677">But if you know that... if you know that a crime has been... a crime has been committed and you destroy documents, that is a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.397" offset="12053525">This is a statute that was enacted against the backdrop of Section 1503 in a well-understood meaning of the word "corruptly".</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.778" offset="12083096">The same word appears in Section 1505.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.360" offset="12093440">When the D.C. Circuit concluded that that provision was vague, as applied to a particular case, Congress came back with a definition that legislatively overruled the D.C. Circuit decision and said "corruptly" means "acting with an improper purpose".</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.770" offset="12151014">The "improper purpose" in an obstruction-of-justice case has traditionally been "the purpose to obstruct justice".</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.287" offset="12177136">That definition logically applies to Section 1512, because Congress enacted the corruptly-persuades provision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it had not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness-tampering in the statute, originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.677" offset="12250697">And some courts concluded that it was no longer punishable under Section 1503, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.705" offset="12270759">To fix that situation, Congress looked to the model of Section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety of acts that are covered that under Petitioner's test would not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering a witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the witness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying documents before a subpoena had been issued, but in an anticipation that the subpoena was likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.604" offset="12374413">Those kinds of acts were considered to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.011" offset="12387997">Similarly, giving advice, even as a lawyer, to an individual to assert the Fifth Amendment in bad faith, not to protect that individual's own interest, but to obstruct justice by protecting other members of a criminal organization, or, indeed, the lawyer himself, lower courts had recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had recognized, but they had uniformly recognized it at the time of the enactment of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.375" offset="12489456">And Congress specifically said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.064" offset="12500219">"We want 1512 to be able to pick up the kinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer prosecutable under Section 1503, and that had not been included in the original version of 1512. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.602" offset="12550374">So that there is history here that explains how these terms should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.258" offset="12568973">And as far as Petitioner's contention that the word "corruptly" does nothing and leads to a series of horrible hypotheticals, actually a sensitive and appropriate use of the word "corruptly" solves those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.318" offset="12621218">Petitioners talk about how people should be able to urge each other not to cooperate with a voluntary investigation, that it's part of citizenship to be able to engage in those conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.696" offset="12670746">But if an entity has subpoena authority and it doesn't invoke it, and it simply invites people voluntarily to cooperate, it is not going to be an intent to subvert, undermine, or impede that proceeding to invite them to exercise that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.095" offset="12728320">If the agency wants their testimony, it can get it through compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.950" offset="12747755">Similarly, Petitioners argue that document policies are, per se, made unlawful under the Government's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.077" offset="12780251">But as the Court of Appeals specifically recognized in this case, a sound application of the word "corruptly" would look to whether there is a threat of some kind of specific proceeding that might trigger an obligation not to destroy the documents before the proceeding gets started.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.837" offset="12851304">And, as well, there are intents that are simply not intents to subvert the administration of justice, that may result in rendering certain evidence unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.138" offset="12896549">And if a person engages in that conduct, it may well violate another provision of criminal law, but it doesn't have to violate 1512.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.946" offset="12927687">And a sound use of "corruptly" prevents all of those hypotheticals from materializing and leading to the conclusion that the statute is unduly broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.032" offset="12968124">Now, Petitioner in this case, in addition to attacking the word "corruptly", also has advanced a number of arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some connection that had to be required between the Defendant's intent in a possible future proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.845" offset="13023295">But the reason that there was no adequate instruction on those issues is largely because Petitioner, itself, deliberately decided to ask for two instructions that were contrary to the statute, and never asked for what it's asked this Court to impose today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.048" offset="13080137">It never asked that the Defendant must be shown to believe that some particular proceeding was likely to occur in the near future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.306" offset="13109185">Instead, what it did is say that the Defendant had to have an intent to impair an object's availability for use in a particular proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.379" offset="13145443">And what the Court of Appeals said is that if there was any problem in that, it's not reversible error; it's harmless, because everybody knew that the proceeding that was anticipated was an SEC investigation of Enron.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.858" offset="13195389">And the other instruction that Petitioners asked for in the District Court is that the official proceeding must be ongoing or scheduled to be commenced in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.693" offset="13234678">But that instruction is flatly contrary to the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.937" offset="13347736">It was told that the informal inquiry by the SEC staff was an official proceeding, and that an official proceeding was already going on at the time of the events at issue here; in fact, even before Nancy Temple even knew about that informal inquiry, which, in and of itself, is reversible error.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.053" offset="13516173">That's the Government's definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.551" offset="13522129">That's in... a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency, and that's not the language that appears in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.562" offset="13546162">Also, in terms of whether Andersen raised this argument, of course they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.231" offset="13568836">They asked for an instruction that the proceeding be ongoing or scheduled, because that was Fifth Circuit law at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.447" offset="13597780">Andersen wasn't supposed to guess that the Fifth Circuit was going to change what it had held in case called Shively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.044" offset="13624111">And the Fifth Circuit understood that Andersen had preserved the argument, and expressly says in its opinion that the issue is, What is the concreteness of the Defendant's expectation of a proceeding that should be required under this statute +/?</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.217" offset="13676774">and found that "feared" was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.360" offset="13685342">That's not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.207" offset="13688790">"Possible" is not enough, especially if a broad definition, like the one the Government wants to have... there's got to be a serious nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.705" offset="13718779">Nexus problems can be avoided, though, if the more traditional definition of 1503.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.875" offset="13775412">As I read to you, the definitions of "corruptly" are completely consistent with Andersen's definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.906" offset="13799549">The Government says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.144" offset="13804565">"Oh, no. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.709" offset="13806759">"In fact, all it meant under 1503 was an intent to obstruct justice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.855" offset="13827344">That can't possibly be what Congress intended for Section 1512, because this Court had held, for... a hundred years ago, that you necessarily lack the evil intent to obstruct if a proceeding is not pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.807" offset="13883141">And 1512 does apply even before proceedings begin, so the definition had to be tailored to the precise circumstances of Section 1512.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.662" offset="13922638">It couldn't import the precise thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.705" offset="13930789">Plus, the definition under 1503 has never been any intent to impede the fact-finding ability is a prohibited intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.326" offset="13969241">That would require lawyers and clients all over the country to go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.118" offset="13984392">It's that you intend to subvert and undermine the integrity of the due administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.198" offset="14016784">And that term does not mean simply to impede the fact-finding; it means that you intend to disobey those duties that are imposed upon you in the course of a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.056" offset="14060147">And cases, including the Howard case cited in our brief and cited by the Government, make that crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.774" offset="14083030">It is not translated to what this jury instruction was, which is that... any intent to impede fact-finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.392" offset="14109466">Just take a look at the examples, if the Government were correct about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.483" offset="14125871">If I were to ask my lawyer to assert, let's say, a reporter's privilege that is debatable, under the Government's... and I do it, because I know that that document is harmful, and I want to keep it out of the proceeding... under the Government's definition, that is corrupt, because I am trying to get another person to withhold a document in order to impede the fact-finding ability of the decision-maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.658" offset="14222629">It makes no sense to define "corruptly" that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.699" offset="14234749">If you, instead, define it with reference to duties, it makes perfect sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.955" offset="14251781">That's not corrupt, because there is no duty to provide a document when you have a good-faith claim of privilege.</text>
