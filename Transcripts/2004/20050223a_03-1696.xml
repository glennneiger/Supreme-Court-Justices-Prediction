            <text syncTime="617.188" offset="2468676">Justice Breyer, the answer to your hypothetical is that appellate review is something different from having a parallel action.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.567" offset="2502217">Appellate review is probably best defined by two characteristics that I'll try to flesh out for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.899" offset="2527504">The first is that the proponent alleges some sort of injury causing error by the trial court and not by the adversary and then seeks an order reversing, vacating, or otherwise nullifying that lower court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.510" offset="2598034">When a party alleges an injury by his adversary rather than the trial court, the most that can really be said is that you are continuing on a parallel litigation but not that you are seeking appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.486" offset="2661878">You do not have what looks like appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.028" offset="2680059">You're not alleging errors by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.257" offset="2688940">You're not seeking an order that directly nullifies or otherwise undoes the State court judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.726" offset="4950831">But the Court said, we're not going to decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.410" offset="4961593">We will allow the district court to address that in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.920" offset="4975595">And so we think that the actually litigated revision of Rooker-Feldman is simply inconsistent with Feldman itself, that it improperly displaces full faith and credit that is not true to the negative implication from section 1257 which has to be a very narrow implication, indeed, because 1257 gives this Court jurisdiction, and it's only appellate jurisdiction, to suggest that another court doesn't have that appellate jurisdiction must be... must be narrowly limited to the context, the type of lawsuits that this Court would seek, which is not simply they did me wrong, please... please give me money, but rather, that lower court erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.363" offset="5177365">It violated my rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.728" offset="5182903">It is structurally or in some... in violation of Federal rights or something that the court did and that you have been asked to fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.908" offset="5211533">That, we think, is consistent with the proper negative implication from 1257, but overrunning most of preclusion law simply is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.751" offset="5250926">For these reasons, we would ask the Court to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.911" offset="5263569">And, Justice Stevens, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>

            <text syncTime="3047.334" offset="12189257">Mr. Coleman, you have 8 and a half minutes left.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.472" offset="12201796">And I'll take just a few of them, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.528" offset="12214021">I believe the concession that the Federal court exercised original jurisdiction at the time our case was filed is an important concession because I simply do not see yet still any rationale for this idea of vanishing original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.451" offset="12281731">I also see the concession made in response to... to your question, Justice Breyer, about what happens if they win on the statute of limitations issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.142" offset="12324467">Well, one of the cases they cite on page 12, footnote 5 of their brief, the Northern Natural Gas case itself makes clear... and there are other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.399" offset="12357590">They went to Delaware to apply the Delaware statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.088" offset="12380264">They conceded in front of the Delaware Supreme Court that even if they had won that, it wouldn't bar another lawsuit in a different forum applying a different statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.406" offset="12425613">The only way they could even hope to get the shorter statute was in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.749" offset="12438988">The Delaware statute would never apply to our Federal claims, so that if somehow it went back on that procedural ground, it would not bar a trial in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.259" offset="12488934">We don't think that that's likely to happen, but that is another explanation yet of why it's moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.211" offset="12508787">We also cited to the Court the Male case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.554" offset="12522162">It is an old case, but it does make clear that when there is the question of jurisdiction before the court and some other court rules on the merits, that does not make the case moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.957" offset="12563749">In fact, you really wouldn't have a need for claim preclusion if that were the rule in... in mootness, because once the case is final over there, they'd all be moot, and you wouldn't need to apply--</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.237" offset="12640862">I mean, it... it would be precluded, but it's certainly not moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.363" offset="12657371">I'd also like to address, just very briefly, the ASARCO question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.904" offset="12675553">The language that the Court used in there we don't necessarily think was loose or inappropriate, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason was the Court cites at that point an amicus brief by the United States and it cites a particular footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.539" offset="12742113">And what that footnote says is it's a recommendation that the mining company in that case could file a Federal lawsuit seeking a judgment that the invalidation of the statute was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.393" offset="12805538">But by challenging the invalidation itself, that... that looks more like a direct challenge to the State court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.656" offset="12834586">It's not simply a relitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.681" offset="12842632">So that behind the Court's language there... and of course, it was really just addressing standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.511" offset="12861962">It was not directly addressing Rooker-Feldman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.573" offset="12870217">But the US's suggestion in that case was a suit challenging the State court judgment, and in that situation, it looks more like appellate review, more likely to infringe upon Rooker-Feldman-type interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.433" offset="12929672">In the end, we believe that preclusion doctrines adequately cover all of this, that it is not true--</text>
