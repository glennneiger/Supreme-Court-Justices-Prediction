            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Arthur Andersen versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.696" offset="30720">As Enron Corporation's financial difficulties became public in 2001, petitioner Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, instructed its employees to destroy documents pursuant to a document retention policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.286" offset="117133">A jury found that this made Andersen criminally liable as a corrupt persuader under Section 1512(b) of Title 18, and the Section is dealing with Obstruction of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.371" offset="185469">The Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.946" offset="199784">We granted certiorari and we hold that the phrase "knowingly corruptly persuades" in 1512(b) requires a consciousness of wrongdoing and that one cannot knowingly corruptly persuade another to shred documents unless one foresees a particular official proceeding in which those documents might be material.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.028" offset="316082">The jury instructions here failed to correctly convey these statutory elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.421" offset="345652">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.789" offset="363102">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
