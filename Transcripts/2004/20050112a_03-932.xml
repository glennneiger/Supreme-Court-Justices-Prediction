            <text syncTime="17.117" offset="68441">This case presents two disparate views of what kind of loss is necessary to sustain a claim for securities fraud under the Reform Act's loss causation requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.303" offset="113162">The minority view of artificial inflation articulated by the Ninth Circuit is illogical and equates loss with purchase, regardless of whether the investor has suffered any economic harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.974" offset="163840">An investor does not suffer any harm until some form of corrective disclosure occurs and the artificial inflation is removed from the stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.315" offset="281182">The... and the statute itself is expressed in terms of causation that a plaintiff prove that the act of the defendant caused the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.996" offset="335935">When we look at the statute of the Reform Act and other provisions, we see supporting language.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.674" offset="362684">In section 21D of the Reform Act, we see under the provision that has been known as the look-back provision that the Congress discussed the loss in terms of trading price after a corrective disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.366" offset="429453">Similarly in section 105 of the Reform Act, although dealing with section 12 of the Securities Act, the Reform Act, in its one place where it actually spoke of loss causation and its definition, defined it in terms of depreciation in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.157" offset="496536">And the... the depreciation in value of the security would be attributable to the fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.834" offset="4115331">Finally, I... the last point I'd like to make is that the Reform Act from Congress was designed to and sought to establish uniform and fairly stringent pleading guidelines, and this was to address congressional concerns over frivolous suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.849" offset="4179383">And Congress, in enacting the Reform Act, was not signaling any intention to relax the requirements of section 10(b), was... rather, was enacting a very specific loss causation requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.664" offset="4218567">And historically there was a very clear and distinct body of law at the time, the Huddleston case, the Bastian case, and that was codified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.810" offset="4263184">And there was a very clear perception that Congress was acting and not collapsing the loss causation transaction rule into the loss... the transaction causation into the loss causation, which I think creates this conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.779" offset="7875082">We believe that lowers inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.718" offset="7882815">I think a good case to take a look at to illustrate this is the Wool v. Tandem case out of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.190" offset="7904758">In that case, Tandem was shipping to its own warehouses for 2 years, lying about its revenues.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.085" offset="14172264">And there are disclosures that are related to fraud and there are disclosures that are not related to fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.381" offset="14429518">And that really indicates that this is a pleading standard that we... we... we're dealing with, that the cause of action for a securities fraud has to be stated at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.857" offset="14463373">And that's consistent with what the Reform Act was trying to achieve which is to give the defendants a chance to respond and actually have the motion to dismiss serve as a meaningful screen in dealing with those cases.</text>
