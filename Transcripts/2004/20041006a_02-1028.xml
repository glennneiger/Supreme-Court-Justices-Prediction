            <text syncTime="58.540" offset="234057">So, therefore, in deciding what the bill of lading by the ocean carrier... what effect it has in terms of binding the actual owner of the property in operating through a freight forwarder, that would be a question of Federal law, Justice O'Connor.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.719" offset="702798">That... that language is so absolutely crystal clear and it arises in the context of a through bill of lading, which made it absolutely clear to Kirby, as the owner of the goods, that this property was going to be shipped overland that there is no way to interpret that language under State, Federal, Australian, or anybody else's law as not extending to this situation except because of the rather peculiar interpretation the Eleventh Circuit adopted based on this Court's decision in Robert N. Herd.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.468" offset="809796">And I think if you recognize that the Herd decision is not meant either to create a magic words exception or to otherwise impose extraordinary obligations on parties who enter into contracts, and that in fact what we're looking for is what was the parties' intent as measured by the language of the agreement, I would suggest to you that under Federal or State law, it is absolutely clear that the ICC bill of lading has to be interpreted to extend to--</text>

            <text syncTime="317.668" offset="1270596">It's... so I hope you will explain to us why... if you think that the Government is wrong, why they are wrong in saying if it's the ICC contract with Kirby, then the appropriate limit is not COGSA but the $450,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.935" offset="1351680">I want to be clear that obviously in our view the... there's no question about the Hamburg Sud bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.167" offset="1376653">That one has a $500 COGSA limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.562" offset="1386162">It's embodied in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.511" offset="1390028">There's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.504" offset="1393998">So, again, to the extent the Court decides this case on the basis of the Hamburg Sud bill, there's no question that you have to worry about the meaning of the ICC bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.882" offset="1427435">With respect to the meaning of the ICC bill, I think the United States is correct that you can certainly read that contract as... as including a higher limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.593" offset="1462335">The problem, of course, is that was not the way the case was litigated in the district court and it was not the way the case was litigated in order to obtain interlocutory review in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.739" offset="1506952">The parties specifically stipulated to the court of appeals that the way this case would be resolved most rapidly was by immediate review because the amount in controversy would be the $500 COGSA limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.454" offset="1557734">So I think there is a very strong argument, Justice Ginsburg, that that issue has been waived by the respondents prior to the time it got to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.397" offset="1725544">Having obtained a benefit by making a representation to the court of appeals, I think there's a... that the Court, this Court, ought to say they are estopped to... to argue another limit at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.005" offset="1767967">Indeed, in our... in our petition, we argue explicitly for the $500 COGSA limit because we took that straight from the district court's own treatment of this issue, and the respondents, in their opposition to the petition for certiorari, did not assert anything to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.709" offset="6554749">I'd like to start at the beginning in this litigation because the district court ruled erroneously, on page 38a of the petition appendix, that the Hamburg Sud bill of lading controlled and allowed Norfolk Southern to limit its liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.667" offset="8090645">But the way the courts have treated this, under the mixed contract doctrine, which we set out in our supplemental brief, is to look at whether the maritime obligations are separable from the non-maritime obligations, and where they are separable, then you would apply the maritime law to that part of it, which is a maritime obligation, here the sea carriage, and you would apply non-maritime law to the inland carriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.219" offset="13084839">And if that means that if that party wanted to break through the limit, they would be bound by the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.359" offset="13141368">I mean, in Herd, it's very important that you understand the very last paragraph of the Court's opinion because the Court there relied on an Australian High Court opinion in which it said... and if I could just substitute the parties and read... Hamburg Sud was engaged by ICC and by nobody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.070" offset="13212212">ICC had no authority whatever to bind Kirby by contract with Hamburg Sud, and no principle of law compels the inference of any contract between Kirby and Hamburg Sud.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.226" offset="13688895">Let me start by trying to clarify the Herd holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.522" offset="13697985">Herd did not involve the Himalaya clause since there was no question about downstream liability or the limits on liability, and so what the Court said there is if your agreement extends to carriers, it doesn't extend on to stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.019" offset="13752007">Our agreements extend well beyond carriers under these circumstances, and we're asking to have them applied in this particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.616" offset="13782413">Justice Stevens, with respect to your question about the rate flexibility that we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.567" offset="13802266">There is no question that the protections of the Hamburg Sud bill, which we... which we accepted for these purposes, carries with it rates that we... there are limitations on liability that Norfolk Southern was intimately familiar with, relied upon in setting the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.851" offset="13859318">You could... you could have assumed that based on the Court's analysis in Great Northern, but the reality is that, of course, entities that engage in these kinds of operations and the kind of common enterprises know what their rates are and they set the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.937" offset="13911667">And if you had broken this rate... this transportation down, it would have required a different rate setting regime, and the... and the circumstances would have been fundamentally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.937" offset="13947716">The basic point here is that there is a reliance and interest that is implicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.312" offset="13965166">Mr. Frederick, with all due respect, has described to you a world that is not the world in which ocean... ocean carriers and rail carriers and shippers ordinarily operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.707" offset="14010828">The world in which we operate is one in which we say either declare the value of the goods or live with the limitation on liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.541" offset="14046145">They never declared any value of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.975" offset="14055863">There's no way for the freight forwarder to declare the value if the shipper doesn't do that in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.071" offset="14076238">And all of the limits of liability flow directly from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.536" offset="14090136">It's not unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.612" offset="14094420">It doesn't unduly limit the remedies available for the owner of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.903" offset="14111556">He always has the opportunity to take advantage of the option of declaring the goods, making us the insurer under those circumstances, and we never do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.737" offset="14146873">The fact that there are no such cases, Justice Breyer, strikes me as the clearest evidence that the rule of law, as we've described it in our briefs and as our amicus have described it, is the standard that has applied to the worldwide carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.080" offset="14196297">One... two last points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.937" offset="14203716">Justice Breyer, you asked me for a couple of theories about how to get to the right answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.107" offset="14220330">One other theory is the entrustment of the goods creates an implied consent to be bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.936" offset="14239660">That's a... an argument that's been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.044" offset="14248124">And then finally, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about the diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.419" offset="14265574">Acme Fast Freight is a post-Erie case, along with Great Northern is itself obviously a decision that comes out of the Minnesota Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.457" offset="14301727">And then finally, with respect to Great Northern, I would urge the Justices to read the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.742" offset="14322939">It's absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.485" offset="14325864">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
