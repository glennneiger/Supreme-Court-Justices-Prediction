            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="9.430" offset="37616">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.096" offset="64366">At the termination of their employment petitioner Rouseys' each took a lump sum distribution from their employers bounds of pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.740" offset="98952">They rolled over these sums in to two individual retirement accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.480" offset="117864">Several years later the Rouseys filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.842" offset="143360">In their bankruptcy petitioner Rouseys sought to protect their IRAs from their creditors by claiming that they were exempt from the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C. Section 522(d)(10)(E).</text>
            <text syncTime="50.580" offset="202292">This provision permits the exemption of the right to receive payment from a plan or a contract that is similar to stock, bonus, pension, profit sharing, or annuity plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.908" offset="271569">Where that right to receive payment is on account of illness, disability, death or age or length of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.328" offset="301244">The bankruptcy trustee respondent Jill Jacoway filed a motion objecting to the exemption of the Rouseys' IRAs under this provison and seeking their turnover.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.173" offset="352653">The Bankruptcy Court granted Jacoway's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.939" offset="367700">The Rouseys appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.774" offset="375014">The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Eight Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.468" offset="389851">The Rouseys again appealed and the Eight Circuit likewise affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.003" offset="407928">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.152" offset="428513">We conclude that the Rouseys' right to receive payment from their IRAâ€™s is a right to receive payment on account of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.239" offset="460904">Under Section 408(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Rouseys have a non forfeitable right to the entire balance contained in their IRAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.772" offset="503014">The Internal Revenue Code however also restricts the Rouseys' ability to withdraw money from their IRAs prior to reaching age 59-and-a-half by imposing a 10% penalty on such withdrawals.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.497" offset="557976">This penalty is substantial and effectively prevents the Rouseys' from accessing the entire balance in their IRAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.491" offset="589949">The penalty is removed once the Rouseys reached age 59-and-a-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.268" offset="609071">Thus, we conclude that the Rouseys have a right to receive payment on account of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.662" offset="630596">We also conclude that the IRAs are similar plans or contracts within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.274" offset="657032">The specified plans, the stock bonus, pension, profit sharing, or annuity plans share one common feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.614" offset="690364">They are substitute for wages earned as salary or hourly compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.090" offset="712307">IRAs likewise provide such an income substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.205" offset="728816">Because the IRAs are similar plans or contract and provide a right to receive payment on account of age, we conclude that they can be exempted from the bankruptcy estate under Section 522(d)(10)(E).</text>
            <text syncTime="195.831" offset="783256">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
