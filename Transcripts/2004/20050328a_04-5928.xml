            <text syncTime="157.834" offset="631327">The question, whether or not the United States will comply with an international obligation that every actor here... the United States, Texas, and the Petitioner... all recognize as binding, is an important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.238" offset="676885">The President has now come in and said that it's even more important, by saying that, in fact, the United States will comply.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.461" offset="973740">The President's determination, in fact, eliminates the... even setting aside its independent force, eliminates the basic objection of Texas to that course of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.870" offset="1027448">So if I may move to that, the Court, as I said, has recognized the importance of the United States complying with an international obligation reflected in treaties entered into by the democratically elected representatives of the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.412" offset="1081574">I want to address the question presented first, because, I... before... setting aside the presidential determination... and just take a look at where we stand after the briefing by the parties as a... on the question whether or not the Avena judgement provides the rule of decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.635" offset="1302465">But the Respondent confuses the creation of a cause of action with what the... a treaty will typically do.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.105" offset="1336320">The treaty here lays out the rights, and the treaty lays out an individual right, as determinated by the ICJ.</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.408" offset="11097548">For the reasons articulated in the brief for the United States and by the State of Texas, this Court should conclude that there was no jurisdiction in the lower court to issue of Certificate of Appealability; and, therefore, the Court should not reach the many questions that Petitioner has raised in this case about the effect of the Avena judgement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.443" offset="11257731">But this is a case where a COA has not been issued, and there is a plain procedural obstacle to its issuance that this Court can determine and, therefore, obviate the need to consider the very sensitive and delicate questions that Petitioner has raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.829" offset="11331291">I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because a COA is a jurisdictional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.364" offset="11353443">And just as a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement and the prerequisites for proper notice of appeal have to be satisfied, the prerequisites for a proper Certificate of Appealability should be satisfied before this Court goes on to reach the merits of a question, which, as Justice Stevens has pointed out, may never need to be reached at all if the Texas courts recognize the President's determination with respect to the Avena decision or apply the Avena decision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.394" offset="11465561">And I think it's very noteworthy that the filing that Petitioner made at the end of last week in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals seeking a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Texas law specifically, at page 25, says that Petitioner is relying on the Avena judgement and he's relying on the President's determination, which are two new sources of law that were not available at the time the Texas courts previously addressed the matter and that now are available, which constitutes a ground for a second petition under Texas law, and that, accordingly, the Texas courts should allow this claim to be developed in the state courts and to be litigated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.334" offset="11633267">To me, those statements are almost an admission that the claims that Petitioner has brought here are barred by failure to exhaust available state remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.962" offset="11743817">If the COA doesn't work, then treat this... I think that's what he's saying... treat it as though it were an application under the All Writs Act or an original writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.807" offset="12003161">And if we affirm or reverse that jurisdictional ground from the Court of Appeals, we'll decide a lot of issues that will create guidance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.834" offset="13339272">The Respondent came to this Court saying that he agrees with Mr. Medellin that America could keep her... should keep her word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.591" offset="13366335">Here's the situation we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.437" offset="13373649">Everybody agrees that these treaties are binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.489" offset="13381904">Everybody agrees now that the President has determined that Mr. Medellin should get exactly what he came to this Court asking for, which is review and reconsideration from the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.399" offset="13421505">The... as Mr. Dreeben has pointed out, and as we advised the Court last week, in order to protect against any statute of limitations bar, we have, in fact, filed in Texas, in order to make these claims, pending the disposition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.546" offset="13474168">And Mr. Medellin is prepared to go forward in state court, making exactly these claims, which the state courts have never had an opportunity to occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.716" offset="13506769">The question here is, How does this Court fulfill its function of ensuring that the United States complies with its international obligations that the President has now confirmed he will comply with?</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.031" offset="13548042">And, of course, the question here is not whether this... whatever this Court does with respect to the question presented here... that is, Does the Avena judgement having binding effect under the Supremacy Clause +/?</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.451" offset="13585763">in this case, would no in any way constrain the President's determination at some future point, because here we have a situation where the President has said "comply".</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.596" offset="13618364">And so, this case does not raise questions... if it operated directly under the Supremacy Clause... does not raise a question about what would happen if, in some future case, the political branches made a different determination once an ICJ judgement came to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.853" offset="13671340">Here, we have the President saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.736" offset="13678864">"You should do exactly what... the United States... what the ICJ said to do. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.769" offset="13699030">So the question is, How does one proceed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.497" offset="13705927">We have proposed a means of going forward that, in our view, is respectful to the authority of this Court, that is respectful to the Texas courts, and that's respectful to the President; and that is, to go forward on the subsequent application in the Texas courts, giving them two issues that they've never had a chance to address, the Avena judgement claim and the claim under the President's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.283" offset="13785130">What should not happen is, that application should not be compromised by any adverse action on this Court, and the suggestion of a dismissal might have compromising effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.232" offset="13828911">At a minimum, it might be perceived as leaving in place a judgement that this Court has already said warranted review and is now, in our view, fatally undermined by the President's determination, as it has been previously fatally undermined by the plain command of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.951" offset="13887739">In addition, we would, no doubt... we're already hearing arguments from the opposition to the motion to stay... we would no doubt hear arguments that, on some subsequence habeas which the United States says is... would be available, that that would be a second or successor habeas, even though Mr. Medellin has never had a chance to bring the... otherwise, to bring these claims to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.502" offset="13966002">And, therefore, the Court might, at some point... at this point, the best thing to do, if we are going to achieve expeditious compliance with the President's determination... is, in fact, to stay; not to deal with any of the questions that have been raised here, but to let the Texas courts deal with them in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.748" offset="14034965">If it comes back to this Court in the posture of a direct... for example, request for certiorari review from a judgement of the Texas courts... there should be no adverse impact from anything this Court did at this posture, simply because Mr. Medellin came here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.407" offset="14093584">And, indeed, it was Mr. Medellin's case that presumably prompted the President to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.044" offset="14112078">That would be unfair, and it would complicated the Court's own disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.093" offset="14124304">What do we have Texas saying before this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.379" offset="14133499">Effectively, Texas has come into this courtroom and said neither the President nor this Court can effect... can give effect of the Avena judgement, because Texas has opposed the Court's authority under the direct operation of the Supremacy Clause, and now Texas has told the Court that the President can't do this either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.259" offset="14197029">And in the face of that suggestion, Mr. Medellin has every hope and expectation that the Texas courts will see their obligations under the Supremacy Clause in a form of both the Avena judgement interpreting and applying the Vienna Convention and the President's determination, differently than the Texas authorities have so far announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.681" offset="14258678">But if it does not, this Court should have the full complement of means at its disposal in order to ensure that the United States complies with its international obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.436" offset="14301727">Mr. Dreeben has, himself, just suggested that there may be circumstances if it were not otherwise achievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.047" offset="14324088">It's hard to think of a more important case for the exercise of this Court's extraordinary writs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.050" offset="14344150">But none of that should be in any way compromised by a dismissal, at this point, simply because the President came in in the midst... in fact, concurrently... into Mr. Medellin's own case before this Court and made this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.648" offset="14394514">Instead, as we'd suggest, the appropriate thing would be... to do is to stay the case, to allow it to go forward in the Texas courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.479" offset="14421891">But if the Court does not wish to stay, we would respectfully suggest that, at this point, under direct command of the Supremacy Clause endorsed by the President's determination, as well as the President's determination itself, the Court should give effect to the United States' promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.357" offset="14477375">Thank you very much.</text>
