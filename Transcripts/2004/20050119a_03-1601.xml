            <text syncTime="166.462" offset="665809">In our view in this case, appropriate relief would mean specific relief, the type of relief that is traditionally given on review of zoning decisions and on review of judicial review of agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.660" offset="706560">That's supported by a number of considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.767" offset="750968">But that's supported by a number of considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.118" offset="760372">First is the structure of the act, which presents it as a form of judicial review of agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.402" offset="781584">The act is structured much as you have... much as you would when a Federal agency enforces or implements Federal requirements and is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.454" offset="813767">The only difference is that Congress swapped in, effectively, State and local agencies with the initial implementers in place of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.800" offset="843128">In that respect, it shares some of the characteristics of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act which are also implemented by local... by... excuse me... by State governments as opposed to the FCC.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.412" offset="937587">And in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.300" offset="985130">Isn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in the... in the measure?</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.528" offset="5702008">Under other views, you have to look at the 1983 action and figure out all of its incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.479" offset="5721861">You have to look at the 332 action and figure out all of its incidents in the abstract as here, not where... in connection with a particular claim for damages, and then see whether they're consistent with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.017" offset="5760000">I think the much better rule would be to say where Congress has created a specific cause of action, that's what it wanted, and whatever you get under that, you get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.107" offset="5792392">Whatever you don't get under that, you don't get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.086" offset="5800333">But 1983 shouldn't be used to... to frustrate Congress' intent and give you things that that cause of action wouldn't to give you a longer statute of limitations, which would be, I think, the case here, to give you... eliminate the provision for mandatory expedition, to have any differences in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.291" offset="5873162">Another way to put it would be under the Court's decision in Franklin, this statute gives you any appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.144" offset="5900539">All that 1983 could do here... it maybe gives you the same thing which, as far as that goes, it doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.634" offset="5922482">But all it could do otherwise would be give you inappropriate relief, i.e., relief that Congress didn't want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.207" offset="5944738">And instead of construing the two statutes in that way, they should be construed harmoniously and in accord with this Court's decisions which have set forth the line of cases where you have a right to get into court in Wilder... I'm sorry... in... in Sea Clammers and Smith against Robinson and said there we want to take Congress' remedy, however simple or complex it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.436" offset="6025718">It gives you a complete right to get into court and gives you whatever it gives you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.151" offset="6040555">And that should govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.282" offset="6045048">And then the other line of cases, which is Wilder where... and... where it says... and the Wright against Roanoke where Congress didn't give you a right to get to court... get into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.727" offset="6078903">In those cases, that's the function of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.411" offset="6089561">The same thing would be true in... in a number of other this Court's cases that have recognized you have a 1983 action when Congress gave you a right and didn't think at all about the remedy because that's the function that 1983 was supposed to serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.628" offset="6478472">And that is incompatible with a damage action because if you get into a damage action, you are going to get into the panoply of... of damages litigation, including depositions, and... and the one thing you can guarantee is that it is not going to be over expeditiously.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.790" offset="6675122">That is, in the... in Sea Clammers and in Smith v.

            <text syncTime="2057.444" offset="8229721">And there's certainly nothing in that language that says when you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is otherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very statute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is enforcing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.229" offset="12788820">And that's the background rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.799" offset="12795193">There are many instances in the Telecom Act and elsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.601" offset="12826331">You may not get 1983 damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.830" offset="12835318">I mean, go back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title II of the Public Accommodations act, Congress expressly... expressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.010" offset="12899997">And I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my client, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was subject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged and entrenched intransigence by this particular municipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example in the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v. the Village of Mequon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.305" offset="13005218">But this Court has recognized, as have the lower courts, that you only get damages if you prove that you really have been damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.933" offset="13039700">And in an instance where there's some procedural violation and a remand to correct it, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus, where the damages are purely nominal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.078" offset="13084212">The agency is given the opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.936" offset="13091736">In this case, the city never said, give us the opportunity to go back and correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.190" offset="13108663">And Judge Wilson, a very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing to go back and correct because the only thing... the only reason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna and tower in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.193" offset="13160699">It... we concede that it makes no difference to anybody which frequencies are being broadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago and have no right to modify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.575" offset="13210227">And therefore, there was a substantive violation, not just, you know, you... you may have had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all out or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not in writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.372" offset="13261427">There's a line of cases this Court has decided under the Social Security Act where there have been remands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and in those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.952" offset="13315762">And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you probably don't get attorney's fees either.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken</label>
            <text syncTime="3352.115" offset="13408444">I'd like to make only two brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.465" offset="13417848">First, that the imposition of the... of damages and fees under section 1983 from a decision in this Court for even good faith mistakes in the implementation of the antenna siting rules, which are often complex and uncertain, would be a welcome mat for extensive and aggressive litigation and the imposition of extensive fees on municipalities which simply cannot afford to enforce their zoning rules, the rules that Congress expressly attempted to preserve in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.579" offset="13530279">It is... in this case alone, for example, respondent's most recent estimate of his damages and fees... and this was before he retained Mr. Waxman, I might add... is... is $15 million, essentially the city's entire budget for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.530" offset="13586077">And respondent claims to be a relatively small operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.791" offset="13599138">That sort of... with that sort of liability in an uncertain area of law, very few municipalities could ever afford to stand on their rights to enforce local zoning even when they're relatively certain that they are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.422" offset="13649607">Section 332(c)(7) is entitled and has one of its purposes as the preservation of local authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.110" offset="13676356">It should not be construed to provide for that authority's evisceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.991" offset="13691925">The second point I wanted to hit is that when Congress established the mechanism for review in 332, it provided a very adapted mechanism with an unusual pair of characteristics: a very short limitations period and mandatory expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.178" offset="13744692">This Court's decisions in Novotny makes it clear that neither of those requirements can be simply transferred over to section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.252" offset="13776980">Novotny had very similar language, a 90-day limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.171" offset="13792653">The Court did not transfer that over to section 1985(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.598" offset="13806341">Instead it understood that the general rule, the general Federal principle of law, that in the absence of an express limitations period, that State law would control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.341" offset="13845316">Wilson then confirms that rule, as an interpretation of section 1988, that the governing Federal principle is that State law controls unless there's an express Federal cause of... statute that addresses that particular cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.292" offset="13901113">If there are no further questions, we ask only that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.667" offset="13918668">Thank you.</text>
