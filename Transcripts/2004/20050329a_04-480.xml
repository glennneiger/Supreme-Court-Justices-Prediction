            <text syncTime="76.366" offset="305424">And the Ninth Circuit decided the case on the assumption, we'd submit, of 90 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.906" offset="319530">But with respect to that 10 percent, what happened, and we submit is completely wrong, is that the Ninth Circuit drew the inference, because it wasn't shown by our expert study, which, by the way, is the only empirical analysis in the case, to be infringing, that the Court could assume that it was noninfringing and then extrapolate from that to a number along the lines of the number that Your Honor suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.894" offset="411481">And I think that that's completely illegitimate analysis, factually, and, besides, that number is big only because the overall activity is so big.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.415" offset="613564">I think what Grokster and StreamCast are arguing is that this Court's decision in Sony stands for the proposition that their massive actual infringement is... gets a free pass, a perpetual free pass, so long as they can speculate that there are noninfringing uses out there, such as public-domain uses and authorized uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.083" offset="708232">We don't think that that... that Sony stands for any such proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.475" offset="721816">We also want to point out that that doesn't help them... that proposition doesn't help them with respect to one very significant part of this case, and that's the fact that they intentionally built a network of infringing users, and they actively encouraged and assisted infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.892" offset="783464">Now, even if there are commercially significant noninfringing uses, and we submit there most definitely aren't under Sony, but even if there are, that's no defense to a contributory infringement claim based on intentional building up of an infringing business and active encouragement and assistance of infringement, and it can't be; because, otherwise, then the fact that they had commercially significant noninfringing uses, again, would be just a free pass to actively promote infringing uses; not merely to support them, but to promote them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.164" offset="13308656">Thank you, Mr. Taranto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.974" offset="13311896">Mr. Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3331.135" offset="13324539">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.882" offset="13335510">I'd like to start by clarifying the inducement issue, and then explain why inducement is not enough, and then have a word, if I might, about the reality of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.354" offset="13369365">The reason, Justice Souter, you find it bizarre is because a shell game is going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.910" offset="13387546">What the Respondent's position... excuse me... the Respondent's position here is that we can sue for specific infringements that we can show were induced by these specific acts, such as e-mail support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.646" offset="13446583">Our position on inducement is that we are entitled to injunctive relief against the continued operation of this gigantic infringement machine, which was built by the inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.844" offset="13487334">Now, I think that the Respondents have quite clearly said that they're... they don't think any injunctive relief is available, going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.196" offset="13516696">But we're entitled, under Section 502 of the Copyright Act, to effective relief, not merely a... relief, judgement relief, that says, "Go and sin no more", but relief that undoes the consequences of this inducement, of this massive effort to build a gigantic engine of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.276" offset="13581061">And that is why they're just wrong about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.875" offset="13595481">And you certainly can't affirm the Ninth Circuit and allow us to go forward with anything like that here, because the Ninth Circuit said the only thing we can sue for... the only thing we can sue for... is a situation in which we can show that we had knowledge of specific acts of infringement at a time when we could stop those specific acts of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.701" offset="13658802">So there's just no way to affirm and let that go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.422" offset="13669669">Now, why is infringement... why is inducement not enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.514" offset="13681998">It's not enough because, as Justice Scalia suggested, these companies already operate in the shadows, and a ruling here, which would be, I submit, a significant cutback of the Sony rule, that inducement is the only available ground of liability, would just need them to paper over... you know, we do have some paper evidence here, a paper trail here, but that'll just... they just won't exist next time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.342" offset="13757336">And it's just... it's just not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.965" offset="13767784">And I submit that Sony was quite clear on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.861" offset="13775412">Sony said that the staple article-of-commerce doctrine, not copyright law, generally, and not secondary liability, generally, but the staple article-of-commerce doctrine, the noninducement part of the analysis, has got to strike an effective balance... a real balance that provides effective protection of copyright, as well as protecting unrelated lines of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.409" offset="13853571">Now, their rule is a rule of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.940" offset="13859736">It's a free pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.364" offset="13865378">It says, all you've got to do is speculate about noninfringing use, and you can continue with infringement, ad infinitum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.865" offset="13895367">And that's not a rule that protects innovation; that's a rule that destroys innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.083" offset="13908323">It certainly destroys the innovation that the creators of the copyright law is supposed to protect, and that's supposed to be the effective protection part of the balance that Sony said this law is supposed to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.817" offset="13947193">It also... it also deters legitimate technological innovation moving towards legitimate means of distributing this... of distributing, in a digital format, music and movies through the kinds of companies that filed amicus briefs and that are trying to do this legitimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.936" offset="14003722">They are inevitably and invariably undercut by the kinds of businesses that Respondents and the others run, so it deters innovation; it doesn't move it forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.132" offset="14040503">And, beyond that, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested, it isn't just that they get to use our copyrighted... the value of our copyrighted materials as the seed capital, that's the whole business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.759" offset="14078955">That is the whole business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.299" offset="14085120">And that's the reality here, and that's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.791" offset="14095151">They can talk about the hundreds of thousands, or maybe even millions, of uses, but the reality is that there are 2.6 billion downloads, unlawfully, every month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.174" offset="14128692">So what they're talking about as lawful is a tiny, teeny little fraction of what's really going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.046" offset="14148127">And the problem with the rule which they say is a clear rule, but it obviously isn't in Sony, because Sony said, "strike a balance".</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.422" offset="14169652">And the problem with that rule, Your Honor, is that it gives them a perpetual license to keep going forward with billions and billions of unlawful downloads a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.982" offset="14203925">They never have to do anything to try to bring their conduct into conformity with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.118" offset="14220434">They're not in the position of that inventor that you identified, Justice Scalia, who has to, sort of, think through, "What am I doing"?</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.546" offset="14242168">They're just in a position where they have every economic incentive in the world to maximize the number of infringing uses, because they make more money when they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.853" offset="14271321">Now, and with respect to the reality of this situation, let me just say... and I must beg to differ, Justice Breyer, with the suggestion that this industry is thriving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.954" offset="14307788">What the... the facts are that we have lost... the recording industry has lost 25 percent of its revenue since the onslaught of these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.165" offset="14340598">And that's particularly critical, because, remember, this is really... the recording business, in particular, is really a venture-capital business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.958" offset="14363794">Most of the records we put out don't make money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.541" offset="14374139">A few make a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.119" offset="14380408">Well, what do you think's getting traded on Grokster and StreamCast and the rest of them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.905" offset="14395559">It's the few that make all the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.440" offset="14401724">So they're draining all of the money out of the system that we use to find new artists and--</text>
