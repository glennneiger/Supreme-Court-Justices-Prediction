            <text syncTime="7.821" offset="31242">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.804" offset="47125">Prisoners typically want two things: first, to improve their conditions while in prison; and second, to get out of prison as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.149" offset="76591">Respondents' claims here are not conditions claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.846" offset="91324">They do not seek a larger cell or better food while in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.140" offset="104490">Rather, their claims are about getting out of prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.232" offset="116924">Traditional understandings of habeas would suggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not in section 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirms that this common sense answer is also the correct answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.867" offset="167393">In fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of which independently prevent respondents from using section 1983 to pursue their claims here.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.568" offset="202188">First, Heck establishes that civil actions under section 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack State criminal judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.447" offset="233744">Before a prisoner can advance a claim under section 1983 that would necessarily imply the invalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it has been favorably terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.838" offset="275331">And Edwards v. Balisok confirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions regarding the duration of confinement count as criminal judgments for this purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.635" offset="322456">I mean, in... in Balisok, what you had was a determination that the confinement would be definitely less as a result of the... the good time scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.109" offset="360385">The... the gut notion behind Balisok was that what you were attacking would imply that the sentence itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.433" offset="609698">And I guess what I'd... I'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court, though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence; that is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement, then that isn't a... or that isn't a claim that should be brought in 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.909" offset="687543">But the durational consequence in those cases was a definite consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in... in the second example.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.827" offset="743236">Here, there... there is no such clear consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.438" offset="757656">Here, the consequence is that there will simply be a period of time before a sentence already imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it will be shortened or allowed to run.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.787" offset="9899050">Prisoners have been bringing lawsuits since Wolff against McDonnell alleging that parole procedures and other kinds of procedures, disciplinary procedures ought to be reformed and seeking future injunctive relief with respect to those kinds of... of procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.062" offset="9968222">In Edwards against Balisok, this Court indicated that ordinarily claims for prospective injunctive relief will not be barred by the Heck doctrine because ordinarily they will not call into question or necessarily imply the invalidity of any previous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.735" offset="10038857">So to Justice Breyer's question, this would require a change in the law, and it would, I think, fairly substantially cut back on the kinds of suits that have been brought for 30 years under Wolff because in all kinds of suits like this, the State would argue, as the petitioners are arguing today, that there's some prior administrative decision that's called into question by a future claim for injunctive relief with respect to some aspect of the procedures relating to good-time credit revocation or parole or the revocation of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.205" offset="10188800">So I think this would be a fairly substantial change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.646" offset="10202488">A lot of these claims would be barred by Heck.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.105" offset="10324323">There are some lower court cases that say that where a prisoner seeks release on parole and demands a right or claims a right to release on parole, that might be cognizable in habeas, but the vast weight of authority in the lower courts is that claims that only seek an... the right to a new parole hearing, the outcome of which is completely discretionary--</text>

            <text syncTime="2694.387" offset="10777496">Dotson is essentially making two claims for prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.814" offset="10795154">He is saying that these 1998 parole guidelines effectively rescind his eligibility for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.237" offset="10820859">At the time of his conviction, he was entitled to parole after serving 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.246" offset="10836950">Under these guidelines, he'll have to wait till... until 32 and a half years have passed before he's eligible for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.957" offset="10863804">And he's claiming that in... in his next parole release hearing, which is in June 2005 and beyond, the State is required to apply the old rules to him so that he'll be eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.497" offset="10913959">So this is very much like what was at issue in Wolff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.676" offset="10926602">The second claim he has is that he's entitled to annual parole release hearings in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.796" offset="10947082">Again, it's a future... it's a prospective claim only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.455" offset="10961816">In the future, he will be entitled to annual parole release hearings, and the new rules say that the State can postpone those hearings for up until 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.557" offset="10998178">So on both of those claims, he is seeking changes in the future, and these are classic 1983 type cases that have been brought, as I say, for the last 30 years in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.896" offset="11043527">Now, the Heck test requires a showing that if he prevails on his section 1983 claims, he would... that would necessarily imply the invalidity of his underlying conviction or sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.195" offset="11112699">And I think this case is very different from the Balisok case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.374" offset="11125447">There... there was a colloquy about that earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.776" offset="11135060">I think that Balisok is clearly distinguishable because the administrative decision there would have had an immediate and direct impact on the duration of the prisoner's sentence by... by revoking the good-time credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.807" offset="11199216">Whereas, here, the impact is very, very speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.884" offset="11215517">Justice Souter, you referred earlier to a durational consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.582" offset="11238296">The durational consequence here is really quite hypothetical and remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.299" offset="11257104">If he prevails on his 1983 claims, all he will be entitled to are future hearings, and since parole is entirely discretionary in Ohio, we can't predict the outcome of those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.072" offset="11312274">He'll also be entitled to... merely to be considered eligible for parole in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.943" offset="11335680">So I think that the... the consequences... any impact on... on the duration of his confinement is... is really quite hypothetical here and it would require an expansion not only of the Heck rule but also of habeas jurisdiction to resolve this case in the State's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.772" offset="11407047">Unless there are any further questions, we would ask that the Court affirm the Sixth Circuit's unanimous decision in favor of Dotson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.527" offset="11446021">All 11 members of that court found that Dotson's claims were not barred by Heck, and this Court should affirm.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.884" offset="11503491">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.697" offset="11506730">A number of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.662" offset="11510596">I wanted to start by responding to Justice Souter's question, which was again asking about this need for entitlement to earlier release as part of habeas, and would ask the Court to consider the In re Braden case where a prisoner in Alabama was seeking to challenge a detainer that had been issued by Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.692" offset="11586664">And the basis for the challenge to the detainer in habeas was the fact that it was having implications for his parole eligibility in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.775" offset="11619056">So there, there was not going to be necessarily an entitlement to earlier release, but simply a difference in the parole considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.443" offset="11649672">Second, Justice O'Connor, with respect to your questions about mootness, the only point that I would add is that if this case is moot now, it was moot when the Sixth Circuit decided it as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.034" offset="11696065">So if mootness is the direction we're going, I think there need to be a decision vacating the judgment below--</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.804" offset="11719158">Well, what's your position as to whether or not it's moot?</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.792" offset="11727099">--Your Honor, we don't believe it's moot either, and in... in fact, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.904" offset="11743608">First, once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing decision, albeit it not the one that was originally threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but there is a new one where that would have that consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.652" offset="11794599">In terms of bad consequences, I think the single biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to 1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of the opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.540" offset="11842142">The Layne decision in the last... decided just 2 years ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action about the way parole works in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.663" offset="11874638">They were successful and their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving--</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.286" offset="11893133">But... but you raise deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.320" offset="11913195">If they wanted that benefit, they could have brought a 1983 action in State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.489" offset="11929913">State courts have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.388" offset="11937541">So it's a little odd for you to say, oh, they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.151" offset="11964604">--That's true, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.297" offset="11969097">At the same time, this... bringing this... this case in 1983 in Federal court means that they're not going to be able to get injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.319" offset="12009221">So they are depriving themselves of a chance to get that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are offering and that courts in other States are offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.730" offset="12042867">The other... the other point I wanted to make is that with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole revocations can't be in habeas either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.338" offset="12101277">A parole... parole... when you're on parole, you're still serving part of your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial term that the court has imposed upon you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.248" offset="12136908">Granted, you're not doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't impact your sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.796" offset="12159164">It would merely bring you back into prison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than having you serve it on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.088" offset="12180271">So I think that understanding of sentence can't make sense for... for habeas purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.572" offset="12286224">This Court in Muhammad said... I think this is probably the... the closest quote on point... challenges to particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the province of habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.099" offset="12384340">And because of those durational consequences, as well as because of the consequences of success on the merits for previous State parole decisions, we believe that those claims are better routed to habeas than to 1983.</text>
