            <label>Mr. David B. Kaplan</label>
            <text syncTime="3.715" offset="14838">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="8.423" offset="33646">I received word that the Court is interested in 46 U.S.C. 801, and I intend to focus my attention on that before I get into my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.113" offset="76382">46-801 is referred to as the Shipping Act, and it was enacted in 1916 and the amendment in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.616" offset="118387">At that time, the United States Government was involved in a war and we were interested in developing the merchant marine for purposes of transporting cargo, equipment, and people back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.860" offset="167393">And so the amendment that was filed was fashioned after exactly 1 U.S.C. 3, but it had some additional features involved, one of which was that a vessel that was under construction was included as part of the act, one of which was if the owner intended to use the vessel for transportation, it was included.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.096" offset="280346">It is under no circumstances affecting a Jones Act claim because the Jones Act requires, number one, a vessel in navigation and it can't be on the dock or being under construction, and if it was under construction, it wouldn't have a crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.390" offset="349518">So under the circumstances, with all due respect, it is our judgment that we... we would win on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.275" offset="381074">The Super Scoop would indeed, qualify under that act as well as under 1 U.S.C. 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.961" offset="587755">But what... what I'm saying is historically there has never been a decision in which a dredge was not considered a vessel until this case that we appear here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.151" offset="656509">Of course, I'm here to seek to have you overrule the decision that was rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.162" offset="680647">But more importantly, we are having a morass in the lower courts, and I'm here to try and persuade this Court to establish, once and for all, that there is a standard, that there is a definition for the use of the word vessel under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.828" offset="751282">Now, in 1920, when the Jones Act was enacted, there was no reference to the use of the word vessel, and we know that when that happens, we have to seek to find what was the meaning, what was the established meaning at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.939" offset="811677">And the way we do that is to look first to statutory law, and in addition we look to case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.172" offset="836650">The statutory law is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.523" offset="846054">In 1873 in the revised statutes it makes it very clear that section 3 describes a vessel is any watercraft that... or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, for transportation on water.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.463" offset="925780">With that standard in 1873, this Court in 1907 tried the case of Ellis v. the United States and did apply that revised statute and decided that the dredges that were working in the city of... in the Boston Harbor were indeed vessels and that the--</text>

            <text syncTime="279.760" offset="1118981">Now, the boat, apart from the fact that it's a couple of hundred yards inland, is capable of being... still capable of being used.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.763" offset="1278955">The Cope case was a drydock and it was run into by somebody and they sought damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.301" offset="1317198">And the Court... this Court said, wait a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.023" offset="1328065">In that case, that's a drydock.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.624" offset="1338410">It goes up and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.450" offset="1341753">It doesn't navigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.225" offset="1348859">It doesn't transport people or cargo over water.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.577" offset="1366204">So they said it's not practically capable of fulfilling under the revised statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.082" offset="1392327">The easiest case is 1926 when this Court again in Evansville made it very clear that a wharfboat, which on occasion was taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.053" offset="1440183">Once a year, I think the evidence is, they would take it out and move it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.231" offset="1452826">But it was affixed to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.915" offset="1463589">It had its telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.772" offset="1471007">It had its sewage.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.366" offset="1485427">And this Court again used 1 U.S.C. 3, but did say that it wasn't practically capable of performing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.203" offset="4128810">It's important to note that in this particular case this is a Coast Guard-certified, inspected vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.487" offset="4257855">Now, as the operator is using that bucket to dump into the scows, he's also handling the... the vessel is also moving through its own deck winches.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.275" offset="6493100">Now, in this case the dredges operate not only... only on the water, but they're out there usually away from shore and are engaged in regular movement over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.845" offset="6535314">And the workers on that dredge, such as petitioner, are subject to the traditional perils of navigation which include not only collision with ships, but even capsizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.543" offset="6574080">Barges such as dredges are particularly susceptible to capsizing because their distance between the deck of the barge and the water, which is known as the freeboard, is low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.195" offset="6616712">In this case it was only 5 feet, and they have a high center of gravity because of those derricks or cranes that are holding the bucket ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.676" offset="6702602">And this Court... we think it's pretty telling that the Court basically in two decisions has resolved this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.809" offset="6727158">You have already used 1 U.S.C. 3 in the Norton case in defining what is a vessel for purposes of the seamen exclusion in the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.944" offset="6759758">And then in the Ellis decision, this Court has already held that a dredge, including the scows that were accompanying that dredge, were vessels for purposes of 1 U.S.C. 3 and that the workers were seamen and that they were basically called upon to perform the duties, more or less, of ordinary seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.495" offset="6825900">And every other court that had looked at the issue and passed on it had equally held that dredges were vessels for a variety of maritime purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.445" offset="13049731">That act did have a definition of vessel that was very restrictive and actually talked about actual navigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.282" offset="13137084">The... the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act was passed in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.278" offset="13157042">Certainly by that point they knew that they had just jettisoned two definitions 7 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.396" offset="13177522">They chose again to leave it to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.337" offset="13185254">In 1972 and again in 1984, there were considerable amendments that Congress did to the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.146" offset="13212526">At that time, they certainly knew... and there's always been heavy... heavy lobbying going on in Congress every time that they try to touch the Longshore Act or... or the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.024" offset="13248052">They knew by that point in time that the circuits were not using section 3 as the definition for Jones Act vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.402" offset="13281593">Again, they chose to leave it to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.087" offset="13292251">They did not intercede and then reference section 3 or incorporate a definition like it or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.492" offset="13313881">They again chose not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.267" offset="13320986">In 1920, section 3 was certainly not the only definition of vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.468" offset="13341780">Benedict on Admiralty, which this Court has cited several times, which the petitioner has cited, had a completely different definition of... of vessel, and that could have been the one that Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.151" offset="13388591">I realize it's always dangerous to mention the Congressional Record, but most of the people who spoke in 1920 and again in... mainly in 1927 were discussing traditional vessels and vessels on a voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.897" offset="13443553">If they had true seamen in mind, they probably had more of a traditional vessel in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.234" offset="13460898">Also looking at the record, when the House wanted to include everybody, all seamen, into the Longshore Act, they listed out various structures such as dredges and barges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.206" offset="13508754">Obviously, a compromise was reached with the Senate, and when the act was passed, they limited it, not just seamen and... and but only to masters and members of crews of vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.897" offset="13551491">They limited it to that and left it, of course, to the courts to decide who is entitled to the Jones Act status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.871" offset="13579389">If I may have a second, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.628" offset="13602482">The term vessel can and often has had a different meaning for the Jones Act, which this Court has stated is a vessel in navigation, than it does with the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.145" offset="13684506">In his amicus brief filed on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Hillsman writes that the lower court unanimously... unanimously... have decided that the definition of vessel for purposes of the Longshore Act is much, much more inclusive than it is for the Jones Act, and it has worked perfectly fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.647" offset="13762560">Under the Longshore Act, most of the persons who collect longshore benefits only have to show it's a maritime nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.689" offset="13790668">There's no vessel requirement from almost all of the claims under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.998" offset="13807909">Another point I wish to make is that both the First Circuit and the petitioner talked about a bright line test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.436" offset="13845734">The First Circuit, though, test is dealing with actual transportation, the actual use in business of the structure during the time that the person who is claiming special status is associated with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.893" offset="13899546">More confusing is dealing with 1 U.S.C., section 3, which although bright is also very broad and would include everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.892" offset="13935491">Anything that floats or is capable of floating would be included under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.805" offset="13955135">There are always going to be situations, no matter what definition the Court comes up with... always situations where a person would have to be covered under both acts, and I realize in the Chandris case, it was the goal of the Court to say we'd like to make it clear as we... we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.441" offset="14021695">We don't want people going in and out of Jones Act status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.330" offset="14033293">However, as this Court saw in Gizoni, a perfect example... in Gizoni, the person was a harbor worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.183" offset="14060669">This Court sent it back to the lower court saying... the lower court had said you're a harbor worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.590" offset="14082299">That's your label.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.333" offset="14085329">You're in the harbor workers' union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.613" offset="14090449">You're not entitled to... for Jones Act status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.874" offset="14103406">This Court said no, send it back, let's take another look.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.301" offset="14117198">The person, although a harbor worker, may have had the requisite connections to a vessel in navigation to be able to claim Jones Act seaman status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.846" offset="14151367">Obviously, in that situation, which is a perfect example, the... the employer would have had to cover him under the Longshore Act and if... if the lower court changes or... or the jury decides that he's a Jones Act seaman, would have had to have covered him under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.284" offset="14213120">Professor Schoenbaum has said that the mutual exclusivity of the two acts is really in theory only and that there are always cases and will be dealing with the brown water seamen and brown water employees, harbor workers and longshoremen, where they're going to have to be covered under both anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.936" offset="14291696">Again, the First Circuit test, which does have an exception to it, which it clearly is... is a snapshot, again to give someone another bite at the apple, which this Court thought, at least in the concurring opinion in Chandris, was a fair result, has that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.744" offset="14354913">But the test itself is... is broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.057" offset="14364212">It... it is a bright line and it makes it clear, as this Court has stated in the past, that unless there's a transportation function, it's not a vessel in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.806" offset="14399216">Thank you.</text>
