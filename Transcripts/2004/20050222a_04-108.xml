            <text syncTime="3403.870" offset="13615438">Mr. Bullock, do you know those four words?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_g_bullock" startTime="3405.522" stopTime="3577.058">
            <label>Mr. Scott G. Bullock</label>
            <text syncTime="3405.522" offset="13622021">I wish I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.321" offset="13637277">I could respond to it if I... if I actually did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.022" offset="13648039">Your Honors, first of all, just a couple of matters regarding the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.217" offset="13680849">The Connecticut Supreme Court did not apply the test that we suggest in our case, they explicitly, the majority explicitly declined to apply heightened scrutiny in this, in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.984" offset="13727869">I think the key to understanding their argument is the answer to the question of, can you take a Motel 6 and give it to a fancier hotel?</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.529" offset="13762038">Their answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.880" offset="13771442">And that's what's really at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.737" offset="13778860">These condemnations are taking place throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.709" offset="13790772">A city in California condemns the 99 cents store in order to give it to Costco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.161" offset="13812611">Now, were they giving enormous benefits to Costco?</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.726" offset="13826821">Of course they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.362" offset="13833404">But they did so because they wanted to get the tax revenue, and that's the problem with these types of condemnations, the desire to help a private party and the desire to help the public are really one and the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.083" offset="13880320">The public only benefits if the private party is successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.459" offset="13897770">All right, the NLDC is a private body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.917" offset="13915638">It has a private board of directors, and it is leasing land to a private developer for 99 years at $1 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.114" offset="13956389">That is private ownership of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.593" offset="13966315">Also, Your Honors, there is no severe assembly problem in this particular case, and in many other development situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.196" offset="13992751">The NLDC and the city have 32 acres that was given to them by the Federal Government for them to do as they wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.544" offset="14022113">And our homeowners who have lived there a long time and wish to hold on to their properties do not object to that development going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.141" offset="14052519">It is within the rights of the city and the NLDC to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.432" offset="14069656">Also, Your Honor, the Rindge case that was cited by the Respondents, they actually knew what was going to go on in that, in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.720" offset="14106854">They knew what the use was going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.495" offset="14113959">And finally, Your Honors, the Respondents talk about the effect that this may have upon poor people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.091" offset="14144261">Not all neighborhoods, not all poor neighborhoods are blighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.127" offset="14164428">But the one thing that all poor neighborhoods share in common is that they don't produce much in the way of tax revenue, so you're going to put poor neighborhoods and working class neighborhoods like the ones that exist in Fort Trumbull in jeopardy if the Court affirms the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.688" offset="14234749">And that's why so many organizations that are concerned about the rights of senior citizens and the rights of minorities and poor folks like legal services corporations have joined in our side to support the property owners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.691" offset="14286681">If there is no further questions, Your Honors, I will close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.489" offset="14301936">Thank you.</text>
