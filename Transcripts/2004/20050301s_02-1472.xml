            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="10.652" offset="42527">Two Indian tribes, the Cherokee and the Shoshone-Paiute entered into contracts with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.940" offset="67709">The government promised to pay for a certain costs called contract-support costs that were related to some health services, and the government just did not pay in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.734" offset="110864">The government's point was, well, Congress did not appropriate enough money to pay for all contracts like this that we have made with a whole lot of Indian Tribes, so what we are going to do is take all the available money and we will allocated it, and we will give each tribe their fair share.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.748" offset="174916">Well, the tribes, these particular two, did not like that and they said we want all the money you promised not just some share of it, and they brought a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.818" offset="207203">In fact, two of them, one in the Tenth Circuit and one in the Federal Circuit, and the tribes won the one in the Federal Circuit and they lost the one in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.206" offset="240744">So, we took cert to iron out that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.457" offset="253806">Now, the tribes' basic argument was they said look at general contracting law.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.938" offset="275749">Now, under general contracting law, the fact the Congress did not appropriate enough money for all the contracts like these, as beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.353" offset="313365">They appropriated enough money unrestricted for our contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.737" offset="330919">It is as if you had a contract with a pencil manufacturer for a million dollars worth of pencils.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.106" offset="352340">The appropriation was $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.748" offset="362893">That is enough to cover the one.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.782" offset="371043">Now, maybe the government entered into ten for $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.164" offset="384627">It is enough to cover all ten, that is true, but it covers ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.366" offset="401450">And that, they said, is good enough to make the promise binding under ordinary law and the government has not contested that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.956" offset="431752">Rather, the government says, these contracts are special.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.395" offset="449515">So, we examined the statute to see what was special about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.579" offset="466233">Now the government says, look at that statute; it is just about special services to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.611" offset="486400">Well, we did look at the statute and it does say the government has to pay contract support costs, and it says nothing about the promise being special.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.997" offset="519941">Indeed it puts the language about what the government has to promise in a section called model contract and it uses the word contract 426 times, but who is counting?</text>
            <text syncTime="140.694" offset="562678">Anyway, that word, "contract", normally refers to "a promise for the breach of which the law gives a remedy".</text>
            <text syncTime="149.809" offset="599144">So, we could not find anything special in that part of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.952" offset="615758">Now, the contract, in that part of the statute, the statute also uses the word subject to the availability of appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.226" offset="652852">They are on stronger ground, the government there, but not strong enough because when we looked into the meaning of that term, we found it has a special technical meaning which does not help the government here which is explained in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.622" offset="702485">Then the government points to some other language in the statute which says, that government need not "reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribw."</text>
            <text syncTime="188.980" offset="755879">And the government says, well, the Indian health service, almost all of our money goes to such purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.392" offset="781479">Some tribe or other, but it did not say all.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.684" offset="794645">It said almost all.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.591" offset="802273">And the almost is where the problem lies because when you look at that almost you see there is enough money left over to pay these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.261" offset="836963">At least the government does not deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.062" offset="848248">But, says the government, we have to use that extra money to pay, for example, the salaries of our Washington office.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.477" offset="877819">What are we supposed to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="221.104" offset="884402">Pay these tribes and close down the office?</text>
            <text syncTime="224.550" offset="898194">But this argument is just a variation on a theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.780" offset="915017">Namely, that the government has better more important, indeed essential uses for money that is in and unrestricted appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.930" offset="955664">And this kind of argument, even if it is true, and we assume it is here, is not ordinarily a sufficient reason for the government to disown an otherwise binding contractual promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.991" offset="1007909">What is the government to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="253.820" offset="1015223">Well, the law, as we understand it, expects the government to avoid placing itself in this kind of dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.680" offset="1042704">For example, by refraining from making less essential contractual commitments in the first place or by asking Congress in advance to protect funds needed for essential purposes with statutory restrictions or by seeking additional funding or, if necessary, by using those unrestricted funds for the more essential purpose while leaving the contractor free to pursue appropriate legal remedies which is just what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.967" offset="1163807">Finally, the government says that Congress passed a special statute later on that makes its promises made earlier non-binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.200" offset="1196722">That statute, however, admits of a different interpretation which does not help the government and we use that different interpretation because otherwise there will be a fairly serious constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.624" offset="1250429">Now, for these and other reasons which we set forth at greater length in today's opinion, we hold in favor of the Indian Tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.971" offset="1279791">We reverse the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.658" offset="1286583">We affirm the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.580" offset="1294315">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the result;</text>
            <text syncTime="328.502" offset="1313959">The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of these cases.</text>
