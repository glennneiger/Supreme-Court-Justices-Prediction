            <label>Mr. Mathew D. Staver</label>
            <text syncTime="39.547" offset="158093">Justice Stevens and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.891" offset="171468">Before this Court is a setting of law in a courthouse and a display on law that contains the universally recognized symbol of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.096" offset="208353">Despite the fact that the deck law occupies only one tenth of this otherwise secular display, the Sixth Circuit struck it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.898" offset="239491">The Court focused solely on the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments and that's aired by ignoring the overall context.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.071" offset="272196">The Ten Commandments is unlike most any other acknowledgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.415" offset="285571">It is in a category essentially all by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.470" offset="297796">It is thematic in common places in courthouses while Nativity scenes and menorahs occur occasionally and often gratuitously on public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.758" offset="334994">The Ten Commandments occurs quite frequently and has for more than a century in courthouses all over this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.619" offset="358400">It is associated with courthouses for a clear historic reason, because the Ten Commandments has played an influential role in American law and government and our system of law in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.425" offset="405629">The context in this case is clearly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.291" offset="417123">Yet the Sixth Circuit--</text>

          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="105.306" stopTime="170.527">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="105.306" offset="421198">May I ask you there basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia made in the course of the last argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.313" offset="453172">The context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in the course of litigation over this and it started out with just the Ten Commandments alone and then version 2, the Ten Commandments had certain... were surrounded by certain quotations of religious content from other texts.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.333" offset="541257">And finally, as I guess literally is true with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten to the present context.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.636" offset="582531">Isn't the problem that you have to face, as I've said before, what Justice Scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.204" offset="624744">Everybody knows that the present context is simply litigation dressing and that the object for what is going on is the object that was revealed in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.836" offset="675318">What is your response to that?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Mathew D. Staver</label>
            <text syncTime="170.527" offset="682005">--Several.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.270" offset="685035">The display in this case has three different phases.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.812" offset="703216">First it was the stand-alone Ten Commandments.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.291" offset="713143">They were sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.527" offset="718054">They could have defended that but they chose instead to switch rather than fight because they wanted to try to comply with this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence, to try to figure out how to be able to display this particular document.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.645" offset="774478">They stepped, however, on a land mine admittedly with this second display.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="197.527" stopTime="200.332">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="197.527" offset="790047">Well, they created the land mine basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.960" offset="799765">I mean--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mathew_d_staver" startTime="200.332" stopTime="262.831">
            <label>Mr. Mathew D. Staver</label>
            <text syncTime="200.332" offset="801228">They were trying to do the best that they could, trying to follow this ever bending establishment clause jurisprudence especially in the area of displays.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.331" offset="837277">Remember this was back in 1999.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.660" offset="846576">At that time, there were less than a handful of reported decisions ever in this country on the Ten Commandments.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.043" offset="872072">The first was in 1973, Stone was in 1980 and there were a couple of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.790" offset="891089">There are only 30 reported cases in the country or so and 23 of those happened from 1999 to the present so they didn't have really any guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.335" offset="925257">They were trying to follow Lynch and Allegheny as best as they could but these are governmental officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.908" offset="947618">They're not jurists schooled in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.880" offset="959425">And admittedly they made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.231" offset="968829">But what they have now is the foundations display and as the District Court recognized, it is fundamentally different than any previous display.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.570" offset="1002266">Like this Court's decision in the Sunday law cases, even though it may have started off for a religious purpose, the Sunday laws were continued to be retained for secular reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.800" offset="1047197">In this case--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="262.831" offset="1051272">Are you saying that the purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't matter?</text>

            <text syncTime="272.324" offset="1089202">We also have an argument later on that this Court should reconsider the purpose prong in generally as it relates to the Lemon test.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="280.476" offset="1121802">--Okay, but if we still have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.949" offset="1143745">The current display includes the display of a lot of legal documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.323" offset="1161195">But is there any reason for anyone to believe that that display of legal documents or anything else would be there for any other purpose than the display of the Ten Commandments, including the religious, the overtly theistic part of the text of the Ten Commandments?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="311.666" offset="1246563">The District Court actually recognized that one of the omni intended effects of the history is to educate everyone of the difference between an acknowledgment and an establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.068" offset="1288255">And even if they had a religious purpose under the second display, that religious purpose has been buried and has been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.985" offset="1323886">They voluntarily accepted the--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="333.214" offset="1332767">You're not abandoning the position that you have a right to make this kind of religious display, are you?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mathew D. Staver</label>
            <text syncTime="344.193" offset="1376758">And that's why we said that they could have defended the individual first display which was the Ten Commandments alone, in part because it is the uniquely recognized historic symbol of law and is commonplace and thematic in the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.279" offset="1429107">They could have defended when they were originally sued on that basis alone but instead they chose to modify the display.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.421" offset="1457633">And when they modified the display, it had excerpted sections around it.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.722" offset="1478844">But is there... I guess... I don't want to tie you up too long but I mean given the history, isn't it still the case that there is no serious reason to believe that there is any object here other than the display of the Ten Commandments including the overtly theistic text and the rest of this is basically enabling context which does not affect the objective, the objective being the Ten Commandments and the religious text?</text>

            <text syncTime="402.044" offset="1608098">Your Honor, they must be able to change their misstep, if it was a misstep, that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.064" offset="1636206">Otherwise, that past taint would be superimposed on the foundation's display forever and the question would be--</text>

            <text syncTime="419.012" offset="1676016">This isn't a case in which they came up with the Ten Commandments display, it got enjoined and 10 years later somebody comes along and says, let's have a display of important documents in the history of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.435" offset="1733695">This in fact is a continuous process and it is a continuous process within the context of litigation about the constitutionality of the display.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.102" offset="1780402">It's not a... the implication is not that you can never have a different display but that there is no reason to believe that the intent of this display has changed as the context has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.598" offset="1834318">What is your response to that?</text>

            <text syncTime="459.796" offset="1839125">--The intent has certainly broadened in this case and there is clearly no evidence in this record that this foundations display is solely purposed or intended to be a religious display.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.910" offset="1879562">In fact, even the respondents of amici that wrote against us said that on the face of this display, it appears secular in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.340" offset="1909342">It does.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.962" offset="1911745">In fact, the foundations display not only has numerous other documents of which the Ten Commandments is only one tenth of these many other document but it also has a foundations document that says what the purpose is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.055" offset="1960124">There is only two places that talk about the purpose on the foundations display.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.289" offset="4637153">Now there was the second display and we are not here to defend the second display but that was the display that was in reaction to the lawsuit filed against the first display.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.941" offset="4715729">In the Lynch against Donnelly case, Mayor Lynch, after the ACLU filed a lawsuit against him, had a rally at the site of the creche, a press conference, where he publicly vowed to fight to keep Christ in Christmas and then he led city workers in carols and said they should sing another one that apparently bothers people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.434" offset="4789708">Yet despite that adverse reaction to the litigation being filed against the city of Pawtucket, this Court upheld the display and although the dissent did focus on the mayor's crusade to keep Christ in Christmas, the majority and the concurring opinions did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.620" offset="4994403">But that actually is something of a change that took place after the litigation began.</text>

            <text syncTime="1270.473" offset="5081861">Okay, but at the end of the day in Marsh, there wasn't any question that what they were doing was praying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.515" offset="5109969">And here it seems to me that the change that you're arguing for as significant is only significant unless it is a change in the essential activity because there is no law and it would be crazy law from this Court that said you can engage in religious endorsement, promotions, et cetera, so long as you hide the ball well enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.744" offset="5226893">What this Court basically has said is you can engage in secular objectives that incidentally involve religious figures or references, e.g., Moses up there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.983" offset="5283840">What you started with in this case or what the county started with was a pretty religious-looking exercise and the question is, did they go from a totally religious exercise to a secular exercise or did they go from an obviously religious exercise to an obscured religious exercise?</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.927" offset="5379657">And therefore, you can't make context a mere change in physical context dispositive because it ignores that distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.194" offset="5460741">First of all, what I think would be a crazy way of having a jurisprudence is for the Court to say that this display is a foundation to the law document, it's perfectly constitutional in every other county courthouse in Kentucky except for McCreary County and Pulaski County because of their prior conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.158" offset="5536601">The second point that I think is important in this context is that I think this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence is already difficult enough to apply without creating the First Amendment equivalent of covered jurisdictions under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.405" offset="5601593">Basically, and I think I understand you, you're saying, and I think you said it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have a... try to move toward an objective criterion saying there are some ways you can display religious things and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as distinct from an intent jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.723" offset="5786854">I don't think it makes any sense that if they end up in the same place, the constitutional rules should be the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.225" offset="6684839">Justice Stevens and may it please the Court, three times in the course of a year, McCreary and Pulaski county posted Ten Commandments displays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.288" offset="6729143">They variously describe the Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code of Kentucky, the central historic legal document of the State and, finally, as the moral background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.749" offset="6798942">In the course of the litigation, they announced that under current law, they announced to the court that uncurrent law, America is a Christian nation and they acknowledge that the purpose of their second display was to demonstrate America's Christian heritage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.693" offset="6858710">In this context, it is our position that the current courthouse display reveals both a purpose and an effect to endorse religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.990" offset="6899879">This Court has repeatedly and most recently in the Santa Fe case made clear that it is necessary to look at the content, the context and the history of a display in order to gauge whether or not there is a true secular purpose or whether or not an asserted secular purpose is a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.529" offset="6982113">We submit here that on this record, the District Court and particularly in the context of an appeal from a preliminary injunction, which we have here, that the District Court had ample evidence from which it could conclude that the asserted secular purpose of McCreary and Pulaski counties was indeed a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.386" offset="7061525">The counties announced their purpose not only in the content of the display itself but in the resolution that the counties enacted, the identical resolutions that the counties enacted within weeks after the filing of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.989" offset="7123905">And in that resolution, the counties make clear that they relied on and cited approvingly the Kentucky legislature's reference to Jesus Christ as the prince of ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.739" offset="7194854">They made clear that they supported the fight of Alabama Supreme Court justice Roy Moore against the ACLU.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.830" offset="7227246">They made absolutely clear in their legal papers that they deemed this to be a Christian nation under current law and they made clear that they absolutely intended and believed they had the right to display the Ten Commandments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.600" offset="7290358">They did so not in a display of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.651" offset="7310524">They asserted and they intended to do so because of the religious nature of the Ten Commandments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.745" offset="7334975">There can be no doubt that the Ten Commandments portrays a religious point of view and is profoundly religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.290" offset="7369143">The Court said so in Stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.232" offset="7376875">There is no serious question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.005" offset="7383980">The question then here is whether or not the counties, in their current display, have done anything to sufficiently neutralize the endorsing message that is contained in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.919" offset="7439673">And we submit it has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.981" offset="7447824">It now announces that the Ten Commandments are the foundation of our legal system, not just that religion is but that the Ten Commandments, a particular religious code, the word of God, it asserts is the foundation of our legal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.668" offset="7510622">It asserts that the Ten Commandments, the revealed Word of God, provides the moral background of the Declaration of Independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.129" offset="7544477">We think it clear that the content of the Ten Commandments and the content of the Declaration of Independence deal with substantially different topics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.620" offset="7834436">There is no fixed per se rule but rather, the context one must look at both the purpose and the effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.974" offset="7859827">In gauging the purpose, one looks at both the litigation history, the social facts, the content and any changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.404" offset="7889607">Here the District Court had not only the display itself but it had the announced purpose of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.907" offset="7931611">It therefore was in a unique position to gauge the purpose of the... the true purpose of these counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.373" offset="7957420">Moreover, it was in a unique position to gauge the effects that the reasonable observer in these small rural Kentucky counties, the reasonable observer's assessment of this particular display.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.778" offset="8015099">And the Court... McCreary County is a county with only 17,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.434" offset="8037669">Whitley City, the county seat, which is not even incorporated, has 1,100 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.431" offset="8057626">The District Court from its chambers in London, Kentucky was well situated to gauge whether or not the reasonable observer, knowing the litigation history of this case and knowing the changes in the forum and the context of this display, would perceive this to be a neutral recitation of history or simply the third in a series of efforts by this county government to post the Ten Commandments because that is what it wanted to post.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.068" offset="8176222">What I'm thinking... let me spell it out a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.237" offset="8192940">The key words in Stone would be that this was posted, the Ten Commandments, because it would lead to, in the circumstances, the students remeditate, venerate, perhaps, and obey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.956" offset="8259814">In other words, their reaction to it would likely be a religious reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.869" offset="8279458">Now, here if you saw it just by itself, perhaps one would be concerned with the intent or the effect of calling to the viewer's mind the sacred character of the law, which is fine for religious people to do but not necessarily fine for the State to do; and that leads them to venerate, perhaps to meditate, perhaps to consider the relationship in a religious way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.448" offset="8405786">If that's the problem, that would exist here only because of the history or most likely because of the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.191" offset="8444761">And if that is the problem, that would dissipate over time because it is the smallness of the audience and their familiarity with the history that would likely produce the similar religious reaction to the display.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.669" offset="12714632">There there is not an endorsement of a particular code, a particular text but rather a neutral educational display about several alternative ones.</text>
