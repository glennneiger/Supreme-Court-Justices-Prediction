            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">Now the second case called Mid-Con Freight Systems against the Michigan Public Service Commission is more complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.513" offset="29989">It concerns a different $100 fee per truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.061" offset="48170">Michigan imposes that $100 fee on trucks that have Michigan license plates but those which are operating entirely in interstate commerce across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.889" offset="107520">There is a federal statute that says when “a state registration requirement” imposes a fee that is really more than a few dollars, it is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.467" offset="177842">Does that federal statute preempt, forbid, Michigan’s $100 fee?</text>
            <text syncTime="50.172" offset="200620">Well, that depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.920" offset="207621">Is the state fee what the statute is about?</text>
            <text syncTime="56.059" offset="224235">Is it a “state registration requirement” within the meaning of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="62.936" offset="251716">We conclude that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.611" offset="262374">That is not the kind of thing that the statute is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.856" offset="279406">We examine the statutes, the federal statutes, language, context, history, and what it tells us is that this statute is about somewhat interesting, what used to be called the bingo card system.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.989" offset="331860">If you have seen a truck, they used to have these things in the front that look like bingo cards with the names or abbreviations for different states, and what they put there was a decal which is a debt from each state which would give them the decal provided the truck showed that it complied with certain federal requirements, like in the sense that they had a federal permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.559" offset="430184">If you did that, you proved that to the state, and then the state give you a little decal, you put it on the bingo card and then you could travel through the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.024" offset="460069">Well, Congress decided that was all too complicated and so it said we are going to have a new system, and it created this statute which creates a new system.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.837" offset="511269">And now, with your interstate truck, you go to one state and they get you all the decals in a sense at one go.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.146" offset="540526">That is what the statute is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.527" offset="550034">Now, is this Michigan requirement about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="141.929" offset="567693">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.034" offset="572082">We go through it and we think the Michigan requirement really has nothing to do with that or not much to do with it and, therefore, it falls outside the words state requirement within the statute and therefore, maybe there is some other thing that prohibits Michigan from having this but it is not the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.690" offset="650658">Now we go through this in the opinion in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.916" offset="663615">It is a close question but we end up affirming the similar determination of the Michigan Court that this statute does not prohibit that Michigan fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.227" offset="704888">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice O’Connor joined.</text>
