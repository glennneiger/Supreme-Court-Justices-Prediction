            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We will now hear argument in case of City of Sherrill, New York against the Oneida Indian Nation of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.120" offset="36467">Mr. Sacks, whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ira S. Sacks</label>
            <text syncTime="11.974" offset="47856">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.358" offset="57365">With the Court's permission, the state of New York, as amicus, will address issues related to the Treaty of Buffalo Creek and I will address the other reasons why aboriginal title and other Indian possessory rights to the properties at issue were extinguished long before the Oneida Indian Nation purchased the properties in 1997 and 1998.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.859" offset="139389">The asserted basis for tax immunity in this case appears at page 1 of respondent's brief which is that the Oneidas have at all times held a tribal possessory right in the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.006" offset="191948">But even if there was a tribal possessory right, aboriginal title or under the Treaty of Canandaigua, in 1805 and 1807 when these properties passed out of tribal hands, the passage of 190 years has extinguished that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.708" offset="254746">For 190 years, these properties have been in private non Indian hands, have been freely alienable, have been transferred to numerable purchasers and have been subject to a full panoply of state and local laws including taxation.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="79.618" offset="318380">Well, is it your position that whenever an Indian transfers land in violation of the Nonintercourse Act, that that's a valid transfer?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.074" offset="356206">And if not, why is this different?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ira S. Sacks</label>
            <text syncTime="91.330" offset="365296">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.581" offset="366237">It is not our position that that would be a valid transfer if there was a violation of the Nonintercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.146" offset="392568">The principal issue here is whether, after of the passage of 190 years, there remains a possessory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.210" offset="424751">If there was a violation of a Nonintercourse Act in 1805 and 1807, Justice Kennedy, we believe the Oneida Indian nation has a... under this Court's decision has a federal common law damage suit against New York state or against the United States of America for failing to exercise its fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.010" offset="499984">But after 190 years, in 1997, they did not have a possessory right to these properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.829" offset="531226">The possessory right we're talking about, aboriginal title or some other tribal possessory right, isn't just the concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.125" offset="560483">As this Court has defined aboriginal title of those possessory rights, it's a right to current possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.704" offset="582740">And under this Court's decisions in cases such as Felix versus Patrick and Yankton Sioux and Williams and Mitchell and Santa Fe, all of which were cited in the dissent written by Justice Stevens, though there was a dissent in Oneida II, tribal possessory rights are barred by that passage of time, the change in the character of the land and the innumerable innocent purchasers.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.861" offset="731429">The basis for the tax immunity here is that this land does not have Indian country status.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.053" offset="772180">For this land to have Indian country status, it has to be, in our view, under this Court, the Venetie decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.872" offset="803422">Federal set asides and federal superintendents.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.928" offset="815647">If you look at how the Oneida Indian nation got this land in 1997, it wasn't because of any set aside by the Federal Government in 1794 even if there was and I will get you that later.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.451" offset="873744">No, I'm just thinking, suppose you have a reservation but the tribel doesn't have a possessory right because in the middle of the reservation, there is some kind of long term lease or sale to a house that's owned by somebody else who is not a member of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.584" offset="930273">I would think... am I right that the city or the county in which that reservation sits can't tax it anyway?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.022" offset="964023">So if you were to say the tribe does not have a possessory right, they can't go and eject all the people who are living there and built houses over the last 192 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.212" offset="1000803">That doesn't mean still that you could tax them.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.574" offset="1018253">But your hypothetical, Your Honor, presupposed the existence of the reservation and presupposed a possessory right subject to lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.177" offset="1052630">The possessory right here did not exist because the Oneida Indian nation had no rights with respect to the land at all in 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.766" offset="1083037">Those rights could not be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.230" offset="1100904">It couldn't be enforced against certain innocent purchases but when the land is reacquired, then it seems to me we have to ask whether there was an extinction of aboriginal title and whether the reservation was at some point subsequently disestablished by federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.836" offset="1179272">If we hold against you on the ground that there was no extinction of aboriginal title and there was no disestablishment of the reservation, then it seems to me that when they reacquire, we get to exactly the point that Justice Breyer raised and that is, once they reacquire the land, why does it become taxable?</text>
            <text syncTime="317.524" offset="1270073">Why does its nontaxable status not simply reassert itself?</text>

            <text syncTime="323.620" offset="1294420">--I think that you have to look at the definition of Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.335" offset="1313332">If you look at the definition of Indian country, it requires, with respect to the properties we're talking about, federal set asides and federal superintendents.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="335.978" offset="1343843">So you're saying if the original establishment of the reservation was simply a continuation, was literally a reservation from a transfer of land to the state of New York and that the Indian title was a purely aboriginal title, not a title conferred by a federal act creating reservations but it cannot be Indian country, is that correct?</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="368.960" offset="1475814">Let's assume the title is aboriginal.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.147" offset="1484487">Nothing in an act of the United States says we're giving you this land to the Indians, e.g., in the Kansas situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.261" offset="1520953">It's simply aboriginal title and it was never extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.629" offset="1538508">Are you saying that if that is the source of the title as opposed to a federal act saying we give this to you, that it cannot be Indian country?</text>

            <text syncTime="394.715" offset="1578841">--No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.355" offset="1581349">In a situation where there was continuing aboriginal title, similar to the Senecas in the state of New York where New York did not terminate the aboriginal rights of the Senecas, there need not be congressional act, there need not be congressional or treaty action to establish the reservation.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="412.918" offset="1651670">So this part of your argument depends on our accepting your position of the treaty of Fort Schuyler as being a conveyance of all property and a later retrocession, is that correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="425.937" offset="1703706">Because otherwise, I don't see what extinguished the aboriginal title.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ira S. Sacks</label>
            <text syncTime="429.857" offset="1719380">What extinguished the aboriginal title with respect to this aspect of the argument, and then I will move on to the treaty of Fort Schuyler and the treaty of Canandaigua.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.724" offset="1758877">What extinguished the aboriginal title is the passage of time, the fact that this land has been under state and local jurisdiction for 190 years and this Court observed, in Hagen and Rosebud Sioux, I acknowledge it was in a different context but this is important, that state and local jurisdiction sovereignty are important in situations like this where what we're dealing with is very few... 1 percent of the land in the City of Sherrill is owned by the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.689" offset="1890743">The land is predominantly non Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.263" offset="1904953">And as this Court observed in Hagen and Rosebud Sioux, a finding of the land now comes back into tribal jurisdiction, to paraphrase, seriously disrupts the justifiable expectations of the community and that's not just a hypothetical in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.889" offset="1967543">I know that but I mean it seems to me one thing that Oneida establishes is that the whole title doesn't just disappear if nothing else happens simply because of the passage of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.346" offset="2061375">They can't come in and eject people.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.863" offset="2071406">But then I'm back to my first question because I take it that the refusal in Oneida to the suggestion that they can't go, say, to Buffalo, New York or wherever or some town and throw everybody out of the house, that that, of course, does reflect the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.223" offset="2148833">But for a city or state to tax the land, that doesn't involve the same kind of interference with people's expectations of living in the houses that they bought, that throwing someone out of his house would involve.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.298" offset="2245172">I'll give you an example that appears from the joint appendix on the Court of Appeals on pages 1263 to 1277.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.082" offset="2272235">In the year 2000, the city of Oneida decided two Oneida nation businesses, a convenience store and a gas station, for 16 fire code violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.930" offset="2307657">The tribe citing this Court's decision in Brendale said, we're not governed by the local fire code.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.608" offset="2334407">We're governed by tribal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.133" offset="2340467">It's more than just the interference, the issue of taxation, the issue of sovereignty is whether a gas station is going to blow up or burn down.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.354" offset="6297391">The treaty on its terms appears to disestablish the reservation entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.669" offset="6314632">Direct statements could perhaps be read as subsequent blocks on that treaty to assure the Indians that they won't be forced off their land, the 5,000 acres that they continue to occupy, perhaps because New York was not a party to the treaty, it couldn't be any explicit session language in the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.823" offset="6379207">New York was the only entity that had the right to buy that remaining 5,000 acres because it held the right of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.909" offset="6403553">So it may be that the Oneidas wanted to be sure that they could reach reasonable terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.634" offset="6422465">They sold all that land within the following six years after consummation of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.354" offset="6441378">So the contemporaneous history squares with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.442" offset="6453708">It's very similar to what happened in Santa Fe in which this Court said there was a reservation that was treated for the Santa Fes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.799" offset="6487144">There was some indication of acceptance of that reservation and that acceptance was decision to terminate the tribe's sovereignty over any land outside of the reservation that was provided to them, even though many of them did not in fact remove to that land.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.530" offset="6666031">Article 2 also notes that the Kansas lands will be a permanent home for all Indians now residing in the state of New York as well as elsewhere and Article 4 states that there will be an exercise of sovereignty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.658" offset="6786612">From the perspective of the state of New York and the localities, it's very serious because it does concern whether or not the tribe can unilaterally regain sovereignty over a very large tract of land in central New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2447.160" offset="9788604">The other was a current value, because Judge McKern said that he would not evict anyone, and that he thought a suitable alternative to eviction was the award of value, because it would put the tribe in a position to a free market and voluntary relationship with the purchasers to, quote, "restore its homeland".</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.395" offset="11345502">--Justice Scalia, actually, it's interesting, in the Joint Appendix in the Court of Appeals, at page 413, is the actual document that governed the transfer of this land, the state statute; and in that statute, the state granted its right of preemption to an individual to acquire the land, because it understood that it had not yet exercised its right of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.294" offset="11417078">That's, in the conduct of the parties, a direct refutation of the idea that the right of preemption was exercised in the Treaty of Buffalo... in the Treaty of Fort Schuyler, the 1788 treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.856" offset="11455321">The most fundamental point, though, about the 1788 treaty is that next came the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, which embodied a federal promise to protect the free use and enjoyment of this land, and the Oneidas possession of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.918" offset="11507670">And that exact promise... not sort of like, but exact... was held in New York to prevent taxation of the Senecas land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.984" offset="11535882">I guess I'd like to make two quick points before I'm out of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.707" offset="11550824">One is that, with respect to the idea that it's just too late, apart from the fact that the question is not presented, I want to emphasize that, in section 2415 of Title 28, Congress explicitly focused on the question of these old claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.817" offset="11611220">And if you read the legislative history, all they talked about was how to deal with the Oneida claim and these old claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.606" offset="11630341">And they not only provided that title claims are not barred by statute of limitations, and established the limitations period that would not have run against the Oneidas because they were on a federal list, but they did the following, which I think is notable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.595" offset="11678302">The statute provides that these claims approved, in 1966, on the day of the statute, there is no room for background equitable principles in federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.374" offset="11721456">Where Congress has specifically focused on a problem addressed it, the idea is, I suppose, that there is no room to fill gaps here by the Court when Congress has decided just what the gaps are and how to fill them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.305" offset="11769208">The other point that I would make concerns the Treaty of Buffalo Creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.427" offset="11785613">The treaty's language leaves it to both sides to decide whether or not Indians are going to Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.113" offset="11808392">The legislate... the history of the treaty shows that the United States backed away from any language which would oblige it to remove Indians, and the language with respect to the Indians left them a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.390" offset="11849456">But, ultimately, all of that is controlled by what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.478" offset="11861891">The Federal Government made a decision that no Indians would go to Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.022" offset="11880072">The idea that Buffalo Creek extinguished reservations in New York would seem bizarre to anyone in New York today, because the Onondagas have reservations, the Senecas have reservations, the St. Regis have reservations, the Tonawandas have reservations, the Tuscaroras have reservations, and the Oneidas have reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.113" offset="11944438">It didn't extinguish just the... there's the idea that you can look at this in a vacuum... it didn't just extinguish the Oneida reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.897" offset="11971500">Under the Santa Fe rationale, the point is not that Congress ultimately intended two reservations, although it has done that often... the Choctaw, the Mississippi Choctaw, the Seminoles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.369" offset="12009430">It frequently happened with removal if there were more than one reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.692" offset="12022700">But here, you would have to believe that Congress intended no reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.908" offset="12035553">You would have to believe that Congress quickly came to the decision that none of these Indian tribes in New York actually had a reservation anywhere, and that's not acceptable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.437" offset="14349688">It rested, in part, upon the session in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.480" offset="14357838">It rested, in part, on a fairly technical argument, to the effect that the grant of Kansas lands was on en presente.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.864" offset="14383438">That is, it was a present grant of Kansas lands, and, therefore, the New York Indians could be disentitled to those lands only if they had... a forfeiture had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.419" offset="14425652">And the Court looked to Article 3 of the treaty to determine the conditions for forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.029" offset="14440072">It said that the Federal Government would have been required to allege a forfeiture by legislative or judicial act, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.424" offset="14465672">The other thing I really wanted to... the point I wanted to make about the reliance interest of the taxing jurisdiction are that no matter how long a particular tract has been taxable, it is... may I finish this +/?</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.211" offset="14512797">it is always within the realm of a city's contemplation that it may be bought up tomorrow by the Federal Government, a church, any other tax exempt entity, and, consequently, the municipality can have no sense of repose that it will remain taxable.</text>
