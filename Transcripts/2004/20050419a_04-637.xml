I would just like to sum up and indicate that... that the State argued in both cases urging the death of two individuals based on killing the same person, and ultimately there was not adequate review in Mr. Stumpf's case indicating that he would have gotten the death penalty notwithstanding Eastman's testimony, notwithstanding their position that he would have gotten the death penalty as an aider and abetter, which is a rather rare circumstance not only in Ohio but also in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.464" offset="13129770">Justice Ginsburg, to respond to your question, under Ohio law you do not need to... to plan to kill the witness in order to have specific intent for aggravated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.702" offset="13190792">I would refer the Court to the In re Washington and State v. Scott cases that we cite in our brief that say that participation in an aggravated robbery where that's going to be done through force or violence or in a manner reasonably likely to result in death is sufficient to support a... an intent... a... an inference of specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.848" offset="13271353">So there's... there's no need to find that they planned to kill the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.337" offset="13285251">If... if I heard Mr. Freedman correctly, he admitted that Wesley would not have a due process argument here because he said the fact finders were apprised of Mr. Stumpf's proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.457" offset="13325793">Well, exactly the same is true in Mr. Stumpf's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.275" offset="13341048">As soon as that testimony became available, as soon as Mr.... as the prosecutor had knowledge of Mr. Eastman's testimony, that testimony was then placed back in the record for further proceedings in the Stumpf matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.070" offset="13392248">The prosecutor made arguments, but I don't think that the Due Process Clause requires--</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.110" offset="13416385">--Hearing on the motion to vacate and further appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.931" offset="13427670">I don't think the Due Process Clause requires the State to admit the ultimate truth of everything that Mr. Eastman testified to at that other trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.130" offset="13464451">The question was did they have a good faith basis for putting him on, and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.148" offset="13480542">And did they have a good faith basis then for arguing that notwithstanding what he said, that the conviction and the sentence in Mr. Stumpf's case were appropriate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.920" offset="13511680">And I believe the record supports that they did have a good faith basis for making that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.775" offset="13527040">If we look at the arguments they made, they were arguments in the nature of, look, there's this evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.999" offset="13551909">You may believe it, you may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.363" offset="13561417">Either way, Mr. Stumpf is correctly eligible for the death sentence under Ohio law and that sentence is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.333" offset="13585241">And the courts found, based on that argument, that Mr. Stumpf had appropriately been sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.820" offset="13607184">This Court has noted that the principal function of habeas is to assure that no man has been incarcerated under a procedure which creates an impermissibly large risk that an innocent person will be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.756" offset="13650965">Well, we don't have that risk here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.824" offset="13659220">Stumpf has knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty, removing any risk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.715" offset="13674789">And if we look to this sentencing hearing, there's no risk that he received an impermissibly large sentence because the prosecutor made the evidence available, and Stumpf's counsel used that evidence and argued it, and the court simply rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.368" offset="13729437">If the Court has no further questions, I'll stop.</text>
