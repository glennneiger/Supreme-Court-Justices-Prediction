            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="7.443" offset="29675">This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.556" offset="50155">It is another case about a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.836" offset="63321">The petitioner, Michael Donald Dodd was convicted in Federal Court of knowingly and intentionally engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S. Code Sections 841 and 846 along with several other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.883" offset="131448">His conviction became final on August 6th, 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.056" offset="152137">More than three years later, in April 2001, Dodd filed a pro se motion for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S. Code 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.494" offset="205949">He sought to set aside his conviction based on an intervening decision of this Court in a case called Richardson versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.741" offset="250880">Dodd tried to take advantage of the one year statute of limitations in a subsection of Section 2255 which provides that the one year limitation period begins to run on the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.307" offset="369162">Dodd argued that that limitation period did not begin to run until April 2002 when the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the right recognized in Richardson applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.940" offset="435722">The Federal District Court dismissed Dodd's motion for habeas as time barred because the Richardson case had been decided more than one year before Dodd filed his motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.744" offset="486922">The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.842" offset="499357">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we affirm the Eleventh Circuit's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.823" offset="527256">We hold that the text of paragraph 6.3 unequivocally identifies one and only one date from which the one year limitation period is measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.937" offset="575739">The statute says the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.589" offset="602279">The second clause of the paragraph has no impact on the date identified in the first clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.035" offset="628088">It limits the paragraphs application to cases in which applicants are seeking to assert rights newly recognized by the Supreme Court made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.220" offset="692872">That means that if this Court decides a case recognizing a new right, a federal prisoner seeking to assert that right will have one year from the date of this Court's decision for judgment within which to file his Section 2255 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.031" offset="760059">He may take advantage of the date in the first clause of paragraph 6.3 only if the conditions in the second clause are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.700" offset="794749">Now, in this case, Dodd's motion sought to benefit from our holding in Richardson which was decided June 1, 1999 so he had one year from that date within which to file his motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.101" offset="848353">Because he did not file it until April, 2001, the motion was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.164" offset="872594">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer join in part; Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion which just Justice Breyer has joined.</text>
