            <text syncTime="18.454" offset="73770">Drunk driving offenses, while most serious and regrettable, were never intended to be crimes of violence under 18 U.S.C., section 16, triggering removal as an aggravated felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.919" offset="123611">We are asking this Court to so conclude and eliminate the disparity and patchwork of decisions that are in the... that are currently in the circuit courts of appeals depending upon the vagaries of where a removal proceeding is instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.030" offset="184111">The Court need not go any further than straight statutory construction and the language of the statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.293" offset="213159">Indeed, the Florida DUI statute has only two essential elements: driving while intoxicated and causing serious injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="65.804" offset="263210">I guess what bothers me about this is that clause (b) of 18 U.S. Code, section 16 is... it says the crime of violence means any other offense that's a felony and, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.389" offset="565499">But the phrase before that is by its nature, so that we don't look at the specific details of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.221" offset="600816">And if by its nature, as a generic matter, as a categorical matter, there is a substantial risk, then quite without reference to the particular facts of the case, it seems to me that the statute applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.939" offset="667690">Well, Justice Kennedy, I would... I would indicate that it's the categorical approach that this Court has indicated should be used in the Taylor case, as well as the courts of appeals have applied the categorical approach... indeed, the Doe case in the First Circuit did so... to look at whether or not that element is present in the underlying predicate of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.025" offset="756088">And the element is the use of force.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.543" offset="766119">Mr. Sollers, I thought your... your response to the problem of (b) was that (b) also requires not just... not just a risk that there be physical injury, but a substantial risk that physical force against person or property be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.233" offset="844904">So it's still the same terminology, using physical force.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.865" offset="859429">And the question we have before us is whether that terminology means it must intentionally be applied or could simply be applied carelessly, negligently, as by someone who is driving DUI.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.950" offset="975726">That is the statutory construction here and it is clear, as you look at the statutory scheme, that individuals who engaged in an accident were not intended to be removed as aggravated felons.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.835" offset="1123265">And I go back to the DUI statute in Florida which does not have the element of the use of force.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.658" offset="1146567">Indeed, that statute is a strict liability statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.522" offset="1258057">Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, there are a number... almost every State has a similar statute to the one in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.611" offset="1290344">Where there is a... simply a causation of injury, there's an enhanced penalty for a drunk driving offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.105" offset="1328379">Of course... so I would suggest that if this Court were to find, as we believe it should, that the use of force is required for it to be an aggravated felony, it would apply across all 50 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.131" offset="1388460">If one were to intentionally use force, there obviously are other statutes that would capture it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.513" offset="8893962">So it's perfectly reasonable to think that Congress would be aware that it would be foreseeable to Congress that the general definitions, the general language it was using might pull in some crimes that were not among those listed in the D.C. Code provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.949" offset="11967739">--I agree he's making an argument about the requirement of intent which he thinks the word use encompasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.992" offset="11995951">He's also making an alternative argument, which is whether or not use requires intent, the crime does not have as an element the use of physical force because you could injure somebody by driving drunk without the use of physical force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.738" offset="12050913">And he gives examples of how you could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.717" offset="12058854">Our position is that even if those examples he gives, for example, swerving and forcing somebody off the road or falling asleep at the wheel and having somebody else crash into you, even if those examples do not, by themselves, involve the use of... involve physical force, it's our view that if you're driving drunk and you're doing those things, there's a substantial risk of physical force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.752" offset="12150909">So on the physical force part of the case, we think we win under 16(b), which means that the only issue that's really in dispute between the parties is whether use requires intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.609" offset="12194377">And for all the reasons in our brief and the reasons I've given today, I think our position is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.837" offset="12239308">Very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.751" offset="12258952">On Justice Scalia's drive-by shooting example, that would be absolutely a use of force that has an element, the attempted use or threatened use against a person or property of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.952" offset="12315794">Respondent's position, as... as I listened to it, would require, as I think the Court fleshed out, that if someone is speeding or someone runs a stop sign and gets in an accident and there's... and someone is... is killed, that's an involuntary homicide or negligent homicide, and that would be a crime of violence for which someone would be removed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.340" offset="12433345">Or even injured, quite possibly, yes, Your Honor, depending on how it's charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.395" offset="12445571">And we do not believe that Congress in any way contemplated that such an offense would lead to such a draconian result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.106" offset="12480366">There was considerable discussion about the difference between the use of force and consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.137" offset="12520490">And indeed, the circuit courts of appeals decisions that respondent can cite have confused the difference between the consequence of an act and the... the use of force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.231" offset="12568869">The Le decision in the Eleventh Circuit, as well as the Tapia-Garcia decision in the Tenth Circuit, both confused use of force with causation of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.942" offset="12603768">And even in the Tenth Circuit, the Tapia-Garcia case has now been disfavored by a subsequent panel in Lucio-Lucio that focused on use of force, and the chief judge in the Tenth Circuit was, in fact, on both panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.903" offset="12663536">So in closing, I would simply indicate to the Court that this is a momentous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.150" offset="12692584">There is a tremendous amount of... there are a tremendous number of ramifications that stem from the findings that a DUI type offense is a violent felony under 18 U.S.C., section 16, and we... we recommend and--</text>
