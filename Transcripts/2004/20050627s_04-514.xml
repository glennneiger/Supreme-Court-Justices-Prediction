            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.355" offset="29362">In 1985, Gregory Thompson was convicted by a jury of first degree murder and was sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.465" offset="53812">In his state postconviction petition, Thompson claimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to conduct and adequate investigation into his mental health for use as mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of the trial, and the Tennessee Courts denied Thompson's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.963" offset="119850">Thompson renewed his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.319" offset="137195">Dr. Faye Sultan is a psychologist and she was retained by Thompson for the federal habeas proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.599" offset="162377">She examined Thompson and concluded that he was likely suffering serious mental illness at the time of the murder that would have been a mitigating circumstance under Tennessee Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.643" offset="214518">Sultan prepared an expert report on Thompson's behalf and was also deposed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.533" offset="234057">The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied habeas relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.902" offset="255582">They held Thompson had not presented any significant probative evidence that he was suffering from a significant mental disease that should have been presented to the jury during the punishment phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.965" offset="295811">Sultan's deposition and report although presented to the District Court as part of an untimely Rule 60(b) motion, had not been properly included in the District Court summary judgment record, apparently because of attorney negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.084" offset="360281">The Court of Appeals denied a petition for rehearing but state issuance of its mandate while this Court considered a petition for certiorari and a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.314" offset="397166">After we denied the petition for rehearing in this Court, the Court of Appeals did not issue its mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.158" offset="424542">The state, under the apparent assumption that the federal habeas corpus proceedings have terminated scheduled Thompson's execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.672" offset="450664">On June 23, 2004, some seven months after this Court denied certiorari, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an amended opinion in Thompson's federal habeas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.282" offset="497058">The new decision vacated the District Court's judgment denying habeas relief and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on Thompson's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.324" offset="533211">The Court of Appeals relied on its equitable power to supplement the record based on Sultan's report and deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.129" offset="568424">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit justified its amended opinion based on the court's inherent power to reconsider its own earlier opinion prior to issuance of mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.765" offset="606981">The state sought review of that decision and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.682" offset="618684">We now hold, assuming arguendo that the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41 does authorize a stay of mandate following the denial of certiorari and also that the court may stay a mandate without entering a formal order that here the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.070" offset="688274">Among our concerns is the length of time between this Court's denial of certiorari and the Court of Appeals issuance of its amended opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.215" offset="716800">The Court of Appeals delayed issuing its mandate for over five months after this Court denied rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.563" offset="738220">The consequence of delay for the state's criminal justice system was compounded by the Court of Appeals failure to issue an order or otherwise give notice to the parties that the Court was reconsidering its earlier opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.416" offset="785659">This in turn, led the various proceedings in State and Federal Court to determine Thompson's present competency to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.704" offset="810736">All of the steps were taken in reliance on the mistaken impression that Thompson's first federal habeas case was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.293" offset="837172">The normal mechanism for correcting errors in the Courts of Appeals is the petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.589" offset="858279">Indeed, in this case, Thompson's petition for rehearing presented the same arguments based on the Sultan evidence that eventually were adopted by the Court of Appeals in the amended opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.617" offset="902374">Our review of the Sultan deposition reinforces our conclusion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion but withholding a mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.644" offset="930482">Had the Sultan deposition report been fully considered in the federal habeas proceedings, it would have been relevant to the District Court's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.201" offset="960784">Relevant though the Sultan evidence may be however, it is not of such a character as to warrant the Court of Appeals extraordinary departure from standard appellate procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.926" offset="995683">Sultan examined Thompson 13 years after his crime and conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.646" offset="1018567">She relied on the deterioration in Thompson's present mental health, something that obviously was not observable at the time of the trial as evidence of what his condition might have been in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.986" offset="1063915">Indeed there was a marked decline in Thompson's condition during the six month period between Sultan's first two visits.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.012" offset="1099964">Sultan's findings regarding Thompson's condition in 1985 are contradicted by the testimony of two experts who did examine him at the time of trial and found that he suffered from no mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.409" offset="1141551">Thompson's trial attorneys chose no to pursue a mitigation strategy based on mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.542" offset="1162136">Instead, they stressed character evidence from family and friends and expert testimony that he had the capacity to adjust to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.099" offset="1188362">This strategic calculation while ultimately unsuccessful was based on a reasonable investigation into Thompson's background.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.760" offset="1227024">One last consideration informs our review of the Court of Appeals actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.433" offset="1249698">This case arises from federal habeas corpus review of a state conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.146" offset="1268506">We have previously recognized that federalism concerns arising from the unique character of federal habeas review of State Court judgments require an additional presumption in favor of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.476" offset="1313855">In this case, a dedicated United States Circuit judge discovered what he believed to have been an error in the previous opinion and we are respectful of the Court of Appeals willingness to correct a decision that it perceived to have been mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.101" offset="1368398">The court's discretion under Rule 41 must be exercised, however, in a way that is consistent with the state's interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the State Court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.282" offset="1413120">By withholding the mandate for months based on evidence that supports only an arguable constitutional claim while the state prepared to carry out Thompson's sentence, the Court of Appeals did not accord the appropriate level of the respect to that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.727" offset="1462857">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.596" offset="1474351">Justice Breyer will announce his dissenting opinion and it is an opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg join.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="376.517" offset="1506011">As Justice Kennedy said, Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice Ginburg and I dissent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.467" offset="1529835">It is a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.330" offset="1537254">It arises out of unusual circumstances of a kind that I have not seen before in the 25 years that I have served in the federal bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.142" offset="1568496">It may sound complicated and technical but it is not; it is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.709" offset="1586782">After the Court of Appeals wrote and issued its decision, and after the rehearing petition was denied, but before the Court issued its mandate, the panel's writing judge happened to come across a document that had been inexplicably omitted from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.434" offset="1661701">It was a psychiatric report based upon a childhood investigation that concluded that petitioner suffered from bouts of schizophrenia at the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.680" offset="1710707">The judge, after spending hundreds of hours reviewing what was a vast record, concluded that the panel's initial opinion was clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.346" offset="1761384">It said there was no such evidence that the document was critically important and that to ignore that document would lead to a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.800" offset="1807151">Consequently, the panel rewrote its decision and it corrected the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.811" offset="1835154">The Court now holds that the panel abused its discretion in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.456" offset="1861799">Well, how could that be so?</text>
            <text syncTime="468.131" offset="1872457">The majority does not claim that the panel was trying to skirt any statutory restrictions, say the restrictions that limit the filling of second habeas petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.372" offset="1921463">Our Court does not claim that the panel's action reflected anything other than what it purported to be, a good faith effort to cure an inadvertent error in a death case to avoid potential miscarriage of justice and those tempted to believe that the document is not seriously and significantly related to the adequacy of trial counsel's performance, or for some other reason is unimportant, might simply read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.031" offset="2044029">It is attached to the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.470" offset="2057822">What, I repeat, was the panel supposed to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="518.872" offset="2075481">Ignore the error?</text>
            <text syncTime="522.016" offset="2088020">We in dissent believe the Court is wrong in this case and more than that, a legal system is based on rules, it also seeks justice in the individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.957" offset="2139742">Sometimes, those ends conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.894" offset="2155520">To take account of that possible conflict, the system often grants judges a degree of discretion thereby providing oil for the rule based gears.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.601" offset="2206302">By reversing the panel today, the Court tells other courts not to act where they believe similar action is necessary to avoid serious injustice in similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.460" offset="2261786">The consequence is to divorce the rule based result from the just result.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.880" offset="2291461">Our judicial systems seeks to avoid that divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.317" offset="2309224">Today's case we figure is an unfortunately step in the wrong direction.</text>
