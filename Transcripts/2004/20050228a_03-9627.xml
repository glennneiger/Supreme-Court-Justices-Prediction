            <text syncTime="1590.639" offset="6362488">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.149" offset="6376594">I'd like to address the structure of the Pennsylvania filing deadlines for post-conviction review because I think they shed some light and need some discussion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.520" offset="6414002">What Pennsylvania did was to establish a 1-year, flat time limit that applies to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.647" offset="6438557">1 year from conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.610" offset="6446393">It's automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.065" offset="6448170">It doesn't matter what the nature of your claims are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.923" offset="6455589">It doesn't matter when you discovered your claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.235" offset="6464888">In order to comply with that time limit, all you have to do is file a post-conviction petition within 1 year of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.634" offset="6490488">The rest of the statute is essentially a separate set of filing deadlines for petitioners, for successive petitioners, for people who either have already had one round of post-conviction review or who haven't bothered to pursue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.040" offset="6548062">Those people, said the legislature, are only going to be entitled to further post-conviction review, to additional rounds of post-conviction review if they fall into a particular class of claim that couldn't have been raised earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.838" offset="6599262">And... and the legislature identified three classes that mirror the three provisions in the Federal statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.814" offset="6627161">And if the petitioner falls within any of those classes, he then has 60 days from the time that that claim arose in order to come into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.481" offset="6661851">Now, if a petitioner files a post-conviction petition and he's within a year of finality, those so-called exceptions don't come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.133" offset="6704483">They don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.148" offset="6708558">He doesn't need to meet them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.650" offset="6714514">Those are for the second petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.591" offset="6722351">So what Pennsylvania really has is a two-level system of statutes of... of filing limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.400" offset="6749518">And of course, in order for the court to determine whether the petitioner has met the filing deadline, he has to look at these three classes for someone who has passed 1 year from finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.424" offset="6793613">That's not an exception in the way I think that the petitioner and some of the lower courts have used the term at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.226" offset="6824856">These are simply different kinds of filing limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.114" offset="6836454">And of course, the court has to look at the statute and the nature of the claims to see whether review is available and to see whether the petitioner has sought review within the proper time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.906" offset="6879608">Nothing about that system makes those so-called exceptions not time limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.552" offset="6898207">They're still time limits, and if you don't file in time and come within one of those classes, then the second petition, successive petition time limits don't apply to you and you're out of time.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Wycoff</label>
            <text syncTime="3172.892" offset="12691540">Several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.690" offset="12706691">First of all, the respondent said that in the second petition Mr. Pace only presented State law, ineffective assistance of post-conviction claims, which are not Federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.381" offset="12749427">That's absolutely not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.950" offset="12755696">He presented the ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel as a waiver-overcoming mechanism not as a substantive claim for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.009" offset="12784013">The substantive claims were due process claim, ineffective assistance of counsel, and new facts which needed to be exhausted under Third Circuit exhaustion law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.282" offset="12817032">Second, respondent suggested and... and the Third Circuit also suggested that State law somehow became clear in mid-December 1997 when the Superior Court, which is Pennsylvania's intermediate court, decided a case called Alcorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.241" offset="12880875">Alcorn was the first case to apply the time bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.418" offset="12893623">But the Third Circuit itself, after Alcorn in the Lambert case, held that the... the statutory language of the time bar is not dispositive and you have to exhaust even if you don't meet one of the statutory exceptions because the court may fashion judicial exceptions just like they did for all the other procedural bar rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.761" offset="12978991">In fact, Pennsylvania in the Lambert case, in their opposition to the certiorari petition in May of 1998, said that that's a correct statement of Pennsylvania law, that there are judicially created exceptions, including the miscarriage of justice exception which will probably apply to the time bar, just like they applied to the other statutory bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.542" offset="13054119">So Alcorn did not, even if it could have, since it's an intermediate court, it did not clear up the state of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.215" offset="13076793">The law did not become clear as to the specific things that Mr. Pace alleged, which is the miscarriage of justice exception under Pennsylvania law and the illegal sentence exception, judicially created exceptions to bar, were not rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court until July of... I'm sorry... August of 1999, which is... by that time Mr. Pace was already out of State court so those... the law became clear in State court after he was already done litigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.663" offset="13198629">The Third Circuit did not actually find the statutory language of the PCRA time bar dispositive of the exhaustion question until March of 2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.877" offset="13239484">The district courts, not just Judge Giles, Chief Judge Giles' 20 years experience on the bench, not just him, lots of district courts send people back to exhaust during this same time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.892" offset="13279504">State law was unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.749" offset="13286922">State law appeared to provide remedies and possible merits review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.669" offset="13302596">Because the State law was unclear, Third Circuit exhaustion law required petitioners like Mr. Pace to go back and exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.183" offset="13332689">And he did exactly what the circuit law required of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.239" offset="13344914">As a matter of equity, the court cannot punish someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.415" offset="13357558">A Federal court can't say, do X, and then after that person does it, say, sorry, you're out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.731" offset="13382844">It's not fair and it shouldn't happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.506" offset="13389949">As to statutory tolling, I just want to... the... the Court I think can just easily decide this case just by reaffirming the central holding of Artuz which is when a State court allows you to file, gives your filing judicial review, applies a bar rule on a claim-by-claim basis, that was a condition to obtaining relief on claims in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.873" offset="13483468">It's not a condition to filing the petition itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.512" offset="13494021">And if the State court eventually holds all your claims are barred, as they did in Artuz, the petition is, nevertheless, properly filed and should toll AEDPA's statutory... under AEDPA's statutory tolling provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.484" offset="13541878">If there are no further questions.</text>
