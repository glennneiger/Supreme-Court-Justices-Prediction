            <text syncTime="395.967" offset="1583856">Why would it make any sense to construe the law that way?</text>
            <text syncTime="399.888" offset="1599530">I... I would think that there would be every reason why you would want to read it to say clean up sooner, not later.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.634" offset="1654491">The law says... actually provides explicitly in 113(f)(3)(B) that if you settle with the State... if, indeed, the State says to you, clean this up and clean up it sooner, you can enter into a settlement with the State to... to engage in the kind of cleanup that satisfies what are the requirements for cleaning up these sites, and that if you do that, then you can come in and sue for contribution because 113(f)(1) gives you a right of contribution in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.870" offset="1767445">So this is not a statute that discourages you from working with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.123" offset="1784477">If you are approached by the State and it says clean up property, it simply says that if you are approached by the State and you want to work with them, you have to do it pursuant to a settlement in order to get contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.640" offset="1830557">If you don't do that, the other avenue for contribution that the Federal statute allows is to proceed in a contribution action during or following an enforcement action by the Federal Government under 106 or 107.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.441" offset="1969737">The way that the provision was written... the 113 provision was added to the statute... it actually provides incentives for parties to come in, to enter into negotiations to get settlements with the Federal and State governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.558" offset="2026162">And indeed, the... the statute provides for a right of contribution if you do that and also protects the party that's cleaning up from contribution suits that might be brought by someone else if they engage in those kinds of discussions and settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.759" offset="2083004">So the statute is one that has incentives built into it to work within the structure that... and the scheme that Congress devised so as to permit parties that are intent on cleaning up their... these sites to go ahead and clean them up and clean them up under the auspices and with the... with the supervision of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.541" offset="2158132">And there's a reason for that because when CERCLA was first passed... and there was no contribution provision at that time... it was enacted because there wasn't a whole lot of voluntary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.366" offset="2197420">And what Congress says is we need to get the Government involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.877" offset="2211422">We need to get them to enter... give them the tools to get involved with these sites, to make sure they're cleaned up.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.346" offset="2241306">We set out a scheme for it to be cleaned up in a way that means it's a meaningful, comprehensive cleanup, and if you follow that scheme that has been devised, you get the benefit of being able to pursue contribution actions once you do things in the way that that has been set up by Congress to ensure it's a... it's a comprehensive cleanup.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.095" offset="5560320">I want to point out that we took that very position in the Pinal Creek invitation brief that we filed in this case that's cited in page... at page... footnote 10 of our invitation brief here and footnote 9 of the... the brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.976" offset="5611833">The second place where they claim an inconsistency is on page 18 where they cite that... the statement in the Centerior brief that says that we are not saying that 113(f)(1) is the only mechanism for allowing contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.299" offset="5669094">And that is in fact true, but we also would say that a settlement would allow as well... would allow contribution as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.326" offset="5693231">Ultimately, the Centerior brief did not address the issue that we have here: what happens in the absence of any type of enforcement action whatsoever or a settlement?</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.607" offset="5734400">So in fact, this is the first time we've addressed the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.041" offset="5744118">Now, in terms of our internal deliberations in the... in the Government, there might well be people who take a different view with regard to the position we've taken here from the perspective that the more suits that are brought, the more cleanup there might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.218" offset="5792810">But ultimately, our obligation is to... excuse me... is to construe the statute according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.162" offset="5816633">And then as Mr. Reynolds pointed out, section 113(f)(1) makes quite clear that a contribution action can only be brought in... in the presence of a pending or ongoing 106 or 107 enforcement action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.167" offset="6064588">This brief suggests that contribution would be available in the face of a 106 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.233" offset="6088829">It implies that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.688" offset="6090710">It doesn't come right out and say it, but that's certainly the implication of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.288" offset="6101055">Now, there's no 106 order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.889" offset="6111504">And the problem with allowing contribution in the case of a 106 order is that section 113(f)(1) speaks of civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.024" offset="6144000">It doesn't speak in terms of administrative orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.292" offset="6153091">It does allow contribution in the case of an administrative settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.357" offset="6169391">So if, for instance, the Government issues an administrative order and the party agrees to comply with that administrative order through an administrative order on consent, that would entitle the party to contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.753" offset="6222994">Now, the reason why this is important is because it's our view that contribution should only be available consistent with the common law principle of contribution in the case in which there's an extinguishment of the underlying liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.263" offset="6273045">That is the very essence of contribution, that there is some third party liability that is being resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.495" offset="6297913">And what 113(f) requires is that... that the liability for the State or Federal Government to be resolved, in whole or in part, through either an enforcement action or a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.589" offset="6346292">Now, this position is entirely consistent with the principles of the... the common law, and in particular, I'd point to the Restatement Third of Torts, which in comment 23 makes clear that in order to have contribution, you have to extinguish the underlying liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.328" offset="6405224">What's more, this position also is... does not discourage voluntary settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.380" offset="6425496">All it requires is that if a party wishes to voluntary clean up a site and also seek contribution, then it needs to reach a settlement with the Federal or State government to ensure that the cleanup is going to be done in accordance with the National Contingency Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.192" offset="6480666">The National Contingency Plan is a volume of Federal regulations that specifies how cleanups need to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.713" offset="6506789">By reaching a settlement with the Federal Government on... on the... the details of the cleanup, it relieves a Federal court of having to make that determination in a contribution action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.116" offset="6548376">As it stands right now in a case such as this, the Federal court is going to be forced to make the determination of whether or not there is compliance with the NCP.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.455" offset="6581812">And that's a highly technical issue and it's an issue that ought to be addressed in the first instance by the Federal or State officials who are experts in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.885" offset="6611487">As it stands right now, if there is no extinguishment of the underlying liability, the court is going to have to... the Federal courts are going to have to resolve these issues without the guidance of those people who are most knowledgeable on that very issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.264" offset="7160999">Under 113(f)(3)(B), if they had entered into a judicial... administrative settlement with the State, that would entitle them to contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.573" offset="7190256">What's more, under the State law, which is Texas Health and Safety Code 361.344(a), all they need for State contribution is to engage in a cleanup that's been approved by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.023" offset="7236023">So there are plenty of avenues for cleanup in these cases and for contribution through various mechanisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.589" offset="7262354">CERCLA is not the only mechanism that's available here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.904" offset="7323585">I'd like to address one other issue here that's been raised by the parties, and I assume that respondents will raise that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.848" offset="7347304">And that is the question of Federal cleanup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.584" offset="7354305">And I would point out that CERCLA is only one of many programs that are provided to clean up Federal sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.900" offset="7379592">The reply brief of petitioner cites, for instance, the defense environmental reparation program, 10 U.S.C. 2701, in which Congress directly appropriates funds for cleaning up formerly used defense facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.784" offset="7435076">There are many mechanisms in which the United States provides for that cleanup apart from CERCLA and it does it in CERCLA as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.448" offset="7501740">The very first thing I want to do is clear up what I consider to be the two most persistent myths in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.681" offset="7526713">The first one is that we didn't bring a 107 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.364" offset="7537371">Justice Kennedy asked about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.972" offset="7543850">Justice O'Connor asked about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.708" offset="7550746">We pleaded this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.499" offset="7557956">I pleaded this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.430" offset="7561718">I drafted the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.371" offset="7569450">I drafted the fifth cause of action in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.971" offset="7579794">And in this case, we pleaded specifically on the very first page of the complaint a claim under 107 and section 113.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.805" offset="7615216">When I pleaded the fifth cause of action, which was liability under CERCLA... that's how it was nominated... I pleaded that this was a cause of action brought pursuant to section 107 and section 113(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.686" offset="7666730">Now, why did I do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.801" offset="7671118">I did that because the controlling law of the Fifth Circuit at the time, as Justice Ginsburg recognized, specified that the cause of action for contribution under CERCLA is derived from section 107 in the first place, and that the mechanism for that, for bringing that cause of action in certain circumstances is governed by section 113.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.502" offset="7761920">And so, yes, we pleaded a 107 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.557" offset="7774145">We do not have... there is no right of cost recovery under CERCLA by contribution or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.267" offset="12201064">Common law is based on experience going back to the old Justice Holmes quote.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.582" offset="12262296">Surely one of the important points in considering this statute is whether or not the interpretation that has been applied for 20 years, that has governed the settled expectations of the parties for all this time, that interpretation should inform this Court as to whether or not the interpretation we are asserting is consistent with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.661" offset="12342544">And it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.019" offset="12396042">So if you're dealing with a mandatory or a permissive construction here, Your Honors, I think the... the permissive construction, which achieves the purpose of the statute, which is entirely permissible under the plain language of the statute, however inartfully it may be drafted, is the one that should be chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.355" offset="12473365">There were a couple of other points, if I may bring them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.571" offset="12498233">Petitioners and the... the United States Government concede in their... in their brief essentially that section 113, the last savings clause, preserves any right of contribution that is separate and apart from 113.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.546" offset="12562181">That refers to the 107 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.170" offset="12580676">That is, in fact, a matter of declaration in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.000" offset="12599902">So if we're entirely correct on that point, then we certainly have a right to proceed here, and I think under those circumstances, our interpretation should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.031" offset="12640026">The purpose of what we're doing here is to get the Federal Government out of the picture as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.232" offset="12660924">Here we will have a multiplicity of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.287" offset="12673045">People will be going to the Federal Government to get orders from the Federal Government because... and to get the Government to sue them, only to disobey those orders, after they're entered, to get the Government to sue them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.350" offset="12717349">There's... this artificiality of the system that petitioner is advocating here really belies the entire purpose of Congress, and I would suggest to the Court that under the circumstances, the judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be affirmed because the achievements that it... it wrought are in fact consistent with the statute's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.630" offset="12794462">If the Court has no further questions, those are the... my concluding remarks.</text>
