            <text syncTime="7.168" offset="28630">This case comes us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.947" offset="51722">Petitioner, California Farmers and farming entities purchased water from the respondent, Westlands Water District which receives its water from the United States Bureau of Reclamation under a 1963 contract between Westlands and the Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.681" offset="122671">In 1993, Westlands and other water districts sued the Bureau for reducing their water supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.084" offset="152242">Petitioners, though not parties to the 1963 contract between Westlands and the Bureau intervene as plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.867" offset="191425">After negotiations, all parties except petitioners stipulated to dismissal of the district’s complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.519" offset="222041">Petitioners pressed forward with the claim that the United States had breached the contract that they were third party beneficiaries entitled to enforce the contract, and that the United States had waived its sovereign immunity from their breach of contract suit in Section 390uu of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.302" offset="329143">The District Court held that petitioners were neither contracting parties nor intended third party beneficiaries of the contract and therefore, could not benefit from Section 390uu’s waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.954" offset="387762">The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.562" offset="402181">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.638" offset="426527">Section 390uu does not waive the United States sovereign immunity from petitioner’s suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.327" offset="457247">The provision grants consent “to join the United States as a necessary party defendant in any suit to adjudicate” certain right under a federal reclamation contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.135" offset="516493">A waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.241" offset="540944">In light of this principle, Section 390uu is best interpreted to grant consent to join the United States in an action between other parties when the action requires construction of a reclamation contract and joinder of the United States is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.611" offset="618371">Section 390uu does not permit a plaintiff to sue the United States alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.822" offset="655256">This interpretation draws support from the statues' use of the words "necessary party", a term of art whose meaning calls to mind Federal Rule of Civil Procedures 19(a)’s requirement for joinder of parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.485" offset="717845">The interpretation also draws force from the contrast between Section 390uu’s language which speaks in terms of joinder and the broader phrasing of other statutes that waive immunity from suits against the United States alone, for example, the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.984" offset="791928">Petitioner’s suit brought solely against the United States and its agents is not an attempt to join the United States as a necessary party defendant within the meaning of Section 390uu.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.891" offset="847517">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
