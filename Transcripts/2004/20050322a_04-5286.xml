            <text syncTime="83.599" offset="334367">This is so because, as even the Government admits, retroactivity decisions almost always come more than a year after a decision of this Court initially recognizing a right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.641" offset="4650527">I mean, by doing so, if the court dismisses it, it could well count as a first motion so that any motion filed thereafter would be a second or successive motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.749" offset="11990936">I think, though, that ultimately what Congress wanted was a 1-year period after this Court initially recognizes a new right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.034" offset="12020088">When the... for that... that period of time the finality that is so important to the criminal law is... does... is suspended to a certain degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.307" offset="12061153">After that, the criminal law can go back to its retributive, deterrent purposes which can only be achieved if finality is recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.951" offset="12095739">I think, in particular, when you're talking about section 2255 motions, frequently the relief, if there is any, is going to be a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.037" offset="12128131">And there's a particular cost, as the Court has recognized, of trying to retry somebody many, many years after an initial conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.205" offset="12156761">Sometimes it means, in effect, it's just an acquittal because you can't find the witnesses or you can no longer prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.460" offset="12181838">And I think, therefore, Congress said, if there's a new right, that's a sufficiently exceptional circumstance, that we can suspend that finality for a brief period, but 1 year and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.880" offset="12227500">These things shouldn't come out 10 years later or 15 years later or 20 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.784" offset="12243069">And that was the purpose, I think a perfectly reasonable purpose the Congress intended to serve here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.135" offset="12268460">And I think that actually the language of it, which says 1 year from the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by this Court, accomplishes that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.548" offset="12566152">I'd like to start with the last point that Mr. Feldman made saying that there is only possible date under which the limitation period can run and... and cautioning the Court about rewriting that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.887" offset="12611500">What the Government neglects to mention is that it's asking this Court to rewrite the if clause by changing Congress' use of verb tense from a past tense to... to something that could happen in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.162" offset="12656640">They want this Court to read that language contrary to Tyler, contrary to the use of verb tense and allow a district court to make a retroactivity decision at some time in the future in every case in which a motion is filed under paragraph 6(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.818" offset="12707213">The second point I'd like to make is that the... in situations such as this that involve these kinds of important rights, interests in finality are at an ebb.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.831" offset="12751308">These are the types of rights where someone may well be innocent of the crime for which they are incarcerated, that involve important rights that go to the accuracy of the underlying adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.829" offset="12795298">It seems to me in these circumstances, there is... it is a situation where Congress' need or... or the need of the courts to enforce finality to keep people in jail are at their lowest point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.013" offset="12840020">These are very special rights and Congress went to the trouble of drafting and enacting paragraph 6(3) and paragraph 8(2) to protect these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.533" offset="12870113">And... and I think the Court should read them as broadly as possible in order to protect those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.461" offset="12889757">Justice Scalia asked a question about the difference between newly recognized and initially recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.661" offset="12934583">I wanted to go back to that for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.983" offset="12939912">There are circumstances where a... let me see if I can get this right... where a... a right may be newly recognized but not yet initially recognized.</text>
