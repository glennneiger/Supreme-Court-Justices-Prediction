            <text syncTime="14.699" offset="58723">In Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the Court recognized an important limitation on the Court's prior substantial Federal question cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.043" offset="92160">The Sixth Circuit should have followed Merrell Dow rather than ignoring it in deciding whether the presence of a Federal issue in this Michigan quiet title action properly gave rise to Federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.110" offset="140434">According to Merrell Dow, any State law claim that alleges a violation of a Federal statute as an element of the State law cause of action does not state a claim arising under Federal law for section 1331 purposes unless--</text>

            <text syncTime="62.665" offset="250567">I mean, I don't think Merrell Dow necessarily had that effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric H. Zagrans</label>
            <text syncTime="68.277" offset="273032">--Agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.222" offset="276793">We believe that Merrell Dow's decision can be synthesized with the holdings in those cases that Your Honor is referring to by reference to the nature of the Federal interest that is at stake and the role that Congress plays.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.151" offset="332591">In the Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Company line of cases and in Hopkins v. Walker, both of those are different sorts of cases from Merrell Dow where Congress provided the Federal right that was alleged to have been violated, and the Court held that when Congress provides a Federal statute that is... is serving as an element of a State law claim, then Congress must have intended also to provide a Federal private right of action in order for there to be arising-under jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.102" offset="464353">That's the distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.578" offset="470309">Haven't we... haven't we got something equally different here?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.499" offset="477936">The... the issue here, as I understand it, is... is not litigation of the State law claim, but a claim under Federal law with respect to the passage of title when property is taken for taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.093" offset="528300">As I understand the... the original plaintiff's claim, it simply is that if he's right, under Federal law he is entitled to a declaration that the property is still his.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.761" offset="571037">If he's wrong, the other side is entitled to property.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.123" offset="588487">But the issue is a Federal issue, and the only way the State has a role in it is that the State provides a mechanism, the quiet title action, analogous maybe to 1983, for getting it into a State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.413" offset="641567">So it seems to me that the issue is a Federal issue, not as in Merrell Dow, a... a State cause of action that incorporates by reference a Federal standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.240" offset="688901">Justice Souter, I agree that it is a Federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.219" offset="700813">I disagree, with respect, that it's different from Merrell Dow because in both that case and this quiet title action under Michigan law, the alleged Federal issue is one element that needs to be alleged and proved in order to make out the State law claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.649" offset="762567">Yes, but I don't... I guess that's where we're parting company.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.954" offset="771762">I don't see that there is a State law claim as distinct from a State law procedure for trying that claim in a State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.467" offset="805825">As I... as I said a second ago, it's sort of like 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.209" offset="820767">It doesn't create causes of action, but it provides a... a jurisdictional basis for getting into court if you've got a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.724" offset="846890">And in this case, it's a Federal cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.310" offset="857234">Under Michigan's Compiled Laws and under the rule of procedure that this action was brought under, the plaintiff had to allege and prove four things: that he had title, the alleged nature of the defendant's title.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.415" offset="917629">He had to describe the property with reasonable particularity, and finally, he had to allege why his title was superior to the defendant's title.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.679" offset="1006655">But as Justice Souter pointed out, the State law incorporated the Federal standard and made it its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.982" offset="1035912">Here you have the Federal tax sale and a very strong Federal interest, which was lacking in Merrell Dow.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.922" offset="1087634">Justice Stevens said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.371" offset="1097456">But here I think there can be no doubt that the Government has a very strong interest in seeing that tax sales convey a secure title.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.632" offset="1142491">No doubt, Justice Ginsburg, but I think it is the wrong emphasis to look to what the State's interest is, which was a... a part of the focus that the Solicitor General's was on.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.882" offset="1191497">For purposes of deciding whether or not Congress intended there to be Federal question jurisdiction, I don't believe the focus should be on the State's interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.875" offset="2807432">And the reason that can lead to confusion is because where you have a statute that governs the relation between the Federal Government and a private person, the words private right of action are out of place normally, because an action between the two parties takes place usually under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.092" offset="2896353">Now, that's what it seems to me is at work here because the real question is not whether we have a private right of action or APA review.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.417" offset="2941597">The question is whether Congress wanted to allow a private person to use this particular Federal provision as the basis for judicial review in a lawsuit.</text>
