            <text syncTime="8.795" offset="35109">Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="31.745" offset="126955">This case today involves a conflict between Oklahoma's semi-closed primary law and a rule adopted by the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma which, contrary to that State law, would allow the Libertarian Party to open its primary elections not just to independent voters, but also voters registered as members of other political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.210" offset="212741">The Oklahoma primary system simply requires that a person who is registered as a member of that party may only vote in that political party's primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.241" offset="252865">If the voter desires to vote in another party's primary, all that voter must do is, within a reasonable time before the elections, primary elections, approximately 7 to 8 weeks, is disaffiliate from that first party and then reaffiliate as a member of that second party, or if the parties so chose to allow independents, he may registered as an independent in order to vote in that primary.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.542" offset="346070">Well, of course, I guess from the standpoint of the Libertarian Party, it's kind of a problem because a voter who wants to disaffiliate under Oklahoma law with their... their prior registration have to do it basically 8 weeks ahead, at which time they don't know if the Libertarian Party will even qualify for having a primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.035" offset="456098">I mean, it just gives them a very impossibly short window.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.691" offset="478668">If the time were reasonable, that might be a different picture, but isn't that kind of burdensome?</text>

            <text syncTime="127.781" offset="511060">Well, Your Honor, the practicality of that matter is... is that generally the parties are notified 10 days/2 weeks in advance of the registration deadline that they are being... if... being recognized as a political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.270" offset="569051">Of course... and that's if that party has waited until the very last minute by statute in which to turn in their petitions and try to get recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.384" offset="609489">Of course, those petitions could be turned in earlier, which would allow them more time to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.984" offset="727876">I guess there's a difference here between the interest of a small party and a large one.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.353" offset="749401">A small party would like, if there is a deadline, to be as close to the election as possible so voters have a chance to get fed up with the two big parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.163" offset="972591">And this Court has found that interest, as recently as in Timmons, that it does have an interest in a stable political system, which may be a two-party system.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.364" offset="1065378">I thought that's contrary to the whole thrust of our holding in cases such as Anderson and Celebreeze where third parties are entitled to special protection under the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.939" offset="1175719">In regards to the requirement of registration, change of voter registration, all of those are applied equally across any... any party, whether it be the Libertarian Party, the Democratic Party, Republican Party, or any other party which may be recognized at that time in the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.456" offset="1257744">And back to Justice Breyer's comments, the period of 7 to 8 weeks prior to a voting... to a primary election is actually a very short time as compared, for example, to Rosario which this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="397.201" offset="1588767">It rejected the raiding and swamping.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.951" offset="1599739">It said that's what the Libertarians want to expose themselves to.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.871" offset="1615412">It's not for a State to be paternalistic to protect them against their own bad choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.558" offset="1642162">But it said this request is damaging to the majority parties, to the major parties, because it poaches on their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.815" offset="1711229">But there is not in this litigation any major party that's complaining about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.426" offset="1733695">So if that is the rationale that the district court went on, can this Court possibly oppose it when there is nobody, as far as we know... they haven't even come into this case at this level, filing a friend of the Court brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.040" offset="1952078">Under Monroe before this Court, I think the Court was looking to the potential, the possibility, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.092" offset="1984366">And as to the fact pattern we had at the trial court, it was a very minor party wanting to... or effectively poach voters from the two major parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.956" offset="2023758">But you have to look at the entire statutory scheme and not just how it would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.893" offset="2051553">But also more importantly, in Monroe this Court clearly stated that a State does not have to wait until it sees actual damage to its political or electoral system to make reasonable decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.678" offset="2106619">In fact, this Court says the States should have the foresight to make those reasonable determinations in an effort to prevent those... those potential evils from occurring if the likelihood of... of that is there.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.528" offset="3778038">In fact, that effect could happen if the Democrats wanted to open theirs up and run that effect on the Libertarian Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.191" offset="3796741">Another reason, especially that is specific to Oklahoma, to help prevent party factionalism and party splintering.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.148" offset="3840522">In Oklahoma, when a new party is recognized, a... a potential candidate has the opportunity within 15 days of the party being recognized of changing his voter registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.853" offset="3887334">That can even be outside the parameters of section 4-119.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.881" offset="3911471">In that instance, there is the potential and I think the probability of this occurring is that... let's say there are four or five candidates who have announced for the Republican nomination if they want to get their nomination, and one of them decides I don't want to compete against those others.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.085" offset="3984300">A new party comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.043" offset="3992137">He is excused from the 6-month disaffiliation requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.501" offset="4009900">Within those 15 days, he can change to the Libertarian Party in hopes of getting that nomination, get the party support and the party structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.030" offset="4044069">By that happening, you then incur... by allowing this party-option primary, then that would promote party splintering, party factionalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.804" offset="4087118">And the manner of that individual going to the Libertarian Party the day of the election without any prior registration... those Republicans who may have supported him leave the Republican Party and start to choose that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.126" offset="4144483">That's splintering that this Court has specifically said is not only a legitimate, important State interest but is also a compelling State interest to effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.164" offset="4252630">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.132" offset="4284500">In the decision below, the Tenth Circuit stuck... struck down an election rule that has been adopted by nearly half the States pursuant to their authority under Article I, section 4 to prescribe the manner of holding elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.250" offset="4340924">In so doing, the Tenth Circuit in our view made three fundamental errors that I'd like to address briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.210" offset="4364748">The first was the Tenth Circuit's per se approach to determining whether the alleged burdens here are severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.790" offset="4395154">That's an extremely important issue, of course, because to our knowledge, this Court has never invalidated a State election regulation under the First Amendment without first finding that the burden at issue was severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.015" offset="4448026">But instead of looking at that issue closely, the Tenth Circuit, at page 15 of its decision, simply assumed that a severe burden necessarily arises from any regulation that, quote, restricts the options of parties seeking to define the scope of their associational rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.970" offset="4531827">Now, one would have thought that it's for courts to determine the scope of a... of a party's associational rights rather than... than the party itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.501" offset="4561920">But in all events, that was the sum total of the Tenth Circuit's analysis on the... on the question of severe burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.459" offset="4589819">Now, the respondents cite that finding, but they... they make no attempt to defend that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.116" offset="4612389">They argue instead that the burden here is severe because, at bottom, Oklahoma requires a Republican or Democrat, wishing to vote in the LPO primary, to... to disaffiliate from the party 2 months in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.438" offset="4669649">But that burden is no more severe than others that this Court has found constitutionally acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.837" offset="4695249">The burden on voters, for example, is less severe than the burden this found... this Court found acceptable in Rosario, which was a... a requirement, as Mr. Poe mentioned, that voters, wishing to vote in a... in a party's primary, register as a member of that party some 8 to 11 months in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.761" offset="4762958">The burden on the party is also less severe than a burden that this Court found acceptable in Burdick which is that a party wishing to qualify for a primary ballot gather the necessary signatures, in that case 1 percent of the voting population, 5 months before the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.223" offset="4832862">It's 2 months here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.709" offset="4838818">And it's also similar to a burden that all the members of this Court found acceptable in Burdick, which was... which was a requirement that a candidate wishing to run on a nonpartisan primary ballot collect the necessary signatures about 2 months before the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.198" offset="4896705">And the message of these decisions... and I think it's fair to say the holding in Burdick... is that requiring participants in elections to take action a few months sooner or a few weeks sooner than they might prefer does not amount to a severe burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.399" offset="4953548">And that's the only real burden here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.547" offset="5050096">So, you know, it probably isn't burdensome to... in principle, to have some disaffiliation requirement, but does the State have to allow enough time so that the decision can be made with knowledge of whether the Libertarians are going to be on the ballot?</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.111" offset="5808379">Now, poaching... poaching is a concern and... and a legitimate and important concern to the States for three important reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.964" offset="5835755">I... I might mention that in Tashjian this Court mentioned in footnote 13 that a... that an open primary could have disorganization effects on the other parties, and poaching is one of those, as the district court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.287" offset="5893120">And... and it's a concern for three independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.849" offset="5903360">First of all, the State has an interest in preventing poaching because that helps protect parties from spurned candidate candidacies which was one of the... the Court in Tashjian identified Storer and Rosario as examples of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.286" offset="5965113">And... and the... the semi-closed primary protects parties against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.397" offset="5989564">For example, if a candidate for the Democratic nomination felt that she wasn't getting enough support from the party leadership before the primary, she might form or join another party and then try to take... take her supporters with her into that other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.834" offset="6051318">And although Oklahoma allows the candidate to switch parties in that circumstance, the... the semi-closed primary and the 7-week period or 7 or 8-week period, standoff period, if you will... that period protects the party from having its voters poached as a result of a... of a spurned candidate joining another party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.782" offset="6127073">The second reason that poaching is a significant concern is that... is that it can lead to efforts, strategic efforts by... by other parties to influence the outcome of another party's primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.983" offset="6183915">For example, suppose we're in California in 2002 a few days before the gubernatorial primaries there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.671" offset="6210664">The Democrats have already decided that their incumbent, Governor Davis, will be nominated, so they're looking ahead to the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.323" offset="6241280">And they see two possible Republican candidates, Reardon and Simon, to pull two names out of a hat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.167" offset="6264581">And they conclude that... that they have a better chance of beating Simon than they have of beating Reardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.649" offset="6290495">Well, what can they do to affect the... the outcome of the Republican race?</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.448" offset="6305750">One possibility, if the Republican primary is open, is to raid it by having some Democrat switch registration and go vote for Simon.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.173" offset="12628637">So they don't have the choice to register as a Libertarian, as the candidate of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party did in Timmons, to change if he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.593" offset="12670328">He chose to stay in the major party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.260" offset="12680986">But that is one significant difference with Timmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.430" offset="12697704">And also, of course, I couldn't... I would also want to mention that Minnesota is a State that has no political party registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.808" offset="12731141">So once again, the problem and issues we're confronted with here could not occur in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.434" offset="12749636">But I think that's significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.124" offset="12756428">And there was... there was nothing on any voter that would have kept them from being able to vote for that particular candidate in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.093" offset="12788297">They were going to be... he was going to be on the ballot in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.437" offset="12801672">In this case, the voters that don't have the choice that that candidate did in Timmons, they are not going to be able to express their opinion on a party that they would like to express an opinion in in their primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.387" offset="12857469">And I think that is a very important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.088" offset="12868336">I think that oftentimes in the standard that the court uses, that there is a difference, sometimes depending on which particular judge writes the decision on how a standard is explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.747" offset="12942942">But in this case, it is, as the Tenth Circuit said and as the district court recognized, something that lies between this Court's decision in Tashjian and this Court's decision in California Democratic Party v. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.599" offset="12998322">But in both those cases, the Court recognized and called for exacting scrutiny when a law was impacting a party's choice as to how it wishes to choose its nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.914" offset="13059553">I do not think that the rationale come up by mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.546" offset="13074181">This thing about draining, taking... keeping the disloyal voters in the Republican and Democratic Party and not letting them come over, whether they wouldn't have voted at all, or whether they didn't have the chance to register as Libertarians, or whether they simply are inspired by the particular candidates, I don't think in that situation that that is either a compelling interest by the State and I certainly don't think it is rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.945" offset="13171775">And in fact, as far as being paternalistic, I think the State is totally wrong there because I think this would actually benefit the major parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.868" offset="13203435">But I am saying to you that this is limited, under the Tenth Circuit's decision, to the facts in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.434" offset="13229662">And in other States, what the States can say there, if it comes up, is what is a difference between us and Oklahoma on ballot access and ballot retention, on voter registration laws, on requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.500" offset="13289953">Do we allow, like a number of the amici States, to have our minor parties select by political party convention?</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.930" offset="13319628">But all of this--</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.463" offset="13465809">I will try and be brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.775" offset="13475004">The important thing to remember, in regards to most of respondents' argument today and in their brief, is that the events and the hurdles they are challenging now were... have never been raised at any time prior to this briefing and this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.722" offset="13550864">The district court did not make findings as to the difficulty of the ballot access or the ballot qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.344" offset="13577300">He merely set forth what those were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.556" offset="13586181">The Tenth Circuit never even addressed anything in regards to ballot access or ballot qualifications and in relation to the need to open up a primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.125" offset="13628500">And in the complaint, at the joint appendix page 22, the specific relief sought by the respondents is to have section 1-104, which is the semi-closed primary section... have it declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.955" offset="13683775">There's no mention of any other relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.222" offset="13692865">No other section, the election primary scheme, or anything else mentioned in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.423" offset="13713659">It's never been raised before and it's never been addressed by any court and... and should not be addressed by this Court at this point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.905" offset="13739572">There are no findings for this Court to rely on to review the allegations that have been made today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.652" offset="13758589">Where the district court... or where the Tenth Circuit did err specifically is they found, as a matter of fact or as a matter of law, based on Jones and Tashjian, that any infringement upon a party's ability to associate is a compelling... must... is subject to strict scrutiny and requires a compelling State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.397" offset="13849496">Jones specifically says that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.536" offset="13862139">Tashjian implies that that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.154" offset="13872588">And the cases since Tashjian's time say a compelling State interest is not always the appropriate test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.234" offset="13900904">You look to the injury and then you look to the burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.950" offset="13915742">In this case, the appropriate burden... or the appropriate injury is not severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.491" offset="13933923">They are reasonable restrictions placed on Oklahoma to maintain the integrity of its political system and its election system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.467" offset="13961822">With that, the restrictions on... in the Oklahoma statutes are reasonable restrictions that govern and control and support important State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.827" offset="14011246">For that reason, the Tenth Circuit was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.206" offset="14020754">The district court was correct in its analysis, and we would ask that this Court reverse that decision and find that those statutes are constitutional.</text>
