            <text syncTime="12.510" offset="49946">There are five primary reasons why this prosecution is outside the scope of anything Congress has authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.941" offset="79726">First, the government's interpretation of the wire fraud statute is inconsistent with the revenue rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.256" offset="105012">Second, it turns the rule of lenity on its head by allowing the government to incarcerate petitioners for 57 months for conduct that has never given rise to civil liability in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.804" offset="155167">Third, this prosecution contravenes our national policy of demanding reciprocity in matters of international tax enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.887" offset="191530">Fourth, the government acknowledged below that it cannot bring this prosecution without disregarding another act of Congress, the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which is, as the name specifies, mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.498" offset="249940">And, fifth, under this Court's decisions in McNally and Cleveland, the wire fraud statute applies only to schemes aimed at defrauding a victim into relinquishing something that it holds as money or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.987" offset="307931">A sovereign's interest in an unassessed tax claim is neither money nor property.</text>

            <label>Ms. Laura W. Brill</label>
            <text syncTime="209.498" offset="837904">I think it just evinces what Congress was concerned about most at the time, Justice Scalia, but it was... it is certainly the case that in any... any time that this country has endeavored to deal with matters of international tax enforcement, it has always demanded reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.312" offset="925153">It has done so through the smuggling statute, it has done so through the numerous tax treaties that the Second Circuit's RJR decision discusses at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.077" offset="964232">And one of the points the RJR decision makes is that, in 1951, at the very time that Congress was looking at the wire fraud statute and enacting it, the Senate was, at the same time, becoming concerned that this country had gone too far in extending reciprocity in connection with its tax treaties and was actually evincing a policy of cutting back on the degree to which we would assist other countries in tax enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.055" offset="1080216">And so the issue is to look at... that the revenue rule must be used as a background principle of common law against which... against which the revenue... excuse me, against which the wire fraud statute is--</text>

            <text syncTime="301.635" offset="1206439">--Well, if it were not... if it did not serve the function... it doesn't matter what the government's intent is and what is in the mind of the prosecutor, but if it did not have any effect of enforcing a foreign government's revenue rule, then, yes, it would be outside; but there are numerous ways in which this prosecution does enforce a foreign government's revenue rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.064" offset="1308212">Certainly, it deters future violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.696" offset="1322736">The sentence was based on the... an estimate of the intended loss, and there was no assessment or an adjudication in Canada to determine what the amount was that was owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.616" offset="1374459">And so the District Court became, essentially, part of the tax enforcement apparatus of the Government of Canada by performing that assessment in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.688" offset="1422733">And so anytime that we impose criminal or civil liability in a manner that affects the tax policies of another country, we are enforcing that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.994" offset="1479889">If we... whether we're requiring compliance with the... with the tax rule of a foreign country or punishing noncompliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.451" offset="1569750">--Well, I think there's a certain amount of self-protection in some of the decision... decisions, surely; but the real... the underlying purpose of the revenue rule is a recognition that foreign... that taxes, in general, are a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.687" offset="1646655">They're inherently policy-based; they're not based on contract or other kinds of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.003" offset="1671941">They do not... they do not assist in resolving disputes between private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.857" offset="1699422">And often they're imposed... especially customs duties, are imposed to disadvantage other countries, and so the courts have said these are a peculiar type of law, they serve only the interest of the... of the foreign sovereign, and there's a particular... there's been a particular sensitivity about scrutinizing those foreign laws, potentially declaring them invalid under the foreign governments' own laws or pursuant to our own Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.554" offset="1810181">And so revenue rules have historically been a categorical exclusion to general principles of comity through which we might otherwise recognize foreign laws or foreign judgements.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.725" offset="1862844">And the rule has come to be so entrenched, and has been so well established, that there's a whole body of background law in the tax treatise of our country, and of many other countries, that is based on our non-recognition and our non-enforcement of foreign revenue laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.640" offset="2006518">But, at least in the Restatement of Foreign Relations now, that's put in terms of... there's no requirement that any country enforce the tax claims or judgements of another; but neither is there any prohibition.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.694" offset="2114769">But there's always been a much greater suspicion, a much greater reluctance, to get into enforcing a claim brought by a foreign country, where that country's own processes have not been allowed to run their course and to have the initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.917" offset="2171611">There... the restate... the second Restatement of Foreign Relations law, which is... was... came out in 1965 and is closer to reflecting what the law was at the time Congress enacted the wire fraud statute, says, in Section 41, Comment L,</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.706" offset="12682762">In the 20th century, those contract cases completely drop out of the picture, and what becomes left are sovereignty cases where a country is seeking to exert its sovereign power inside the United States or inside a foreign country... the United States, itself, tried it once in Canada... to collect taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.977" offset="13263830">The common law cases universally say that it does not matter who is bringing the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.086" offset="13348258">On the... on the issue of the identity of the person bringing the claim, the contract cases, Holman and Boucher, stand for that proposition, and the Peter Buchanan case, which came down in 1950, just before the wire fraud statute was enacted... this was in the Appellate Court in Ireland... it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.101" offset="13424327">"It is not a question whether the plaintiff is a foreign state or the representative of a foreign state or its revenue authority. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.519" offset="13466018">"And if it then appears that it is really a suit brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of a foreign revenue, it must be rejected. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.510" offset="13497992">That's at 1955 A.C. 529.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.644" offset="13518576">And so with the... with the Mandatory Restitution Act, this clearly is something to collect the debts of a foreign nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.513" offset="13550028">And the sentencing scheme that Justice Ginsburg alluded to earlier, in which the sentences were enhanced based on the intended loss, demonstrate that this is an enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.204" offset="13592764">Stringam versus Dubois, which is an Alberta case from 1992, involving... the plaintiff there was an executor of a probate estate, and the court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.433" offset="13637695">"The identity of the plaintiff in the action is not vital if the action indirectly has the effect of enforcing revenue laws of a foreign country. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.950" offset="13683775">And the way the revenue rule has been cited repeatedly is that it... what it prevents is not just direct enforcement, but direct or indirect enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.269" offset="13725048">And so it is... the fact that there have not been criminal prosecutions, it clearly would have been in derogation of the common law for a... for England to pass a statute saying it is criminal in England to break the laws of France.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.237" offset="14084911">In Cleveland, the court was very clear to point out... one of the reasons to adopt a rule of lenity in interpreting the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud statute is because violations serve as a predicate for RICO actions and for money-laundering violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.919" offset="14159621">And so what the government's position is, is that we should carve out this ad-hoc exception and allow wire fraud prosecution, even though we would not allow any kind of a civil RICO action and even though we're going to have an ad-hoc exception for the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.175" offset="14228689">But what the court said in Cleveland is, the way we should do this is by adopting a proper interpretation in the first place, not by... of the wire fraud statute... not by having ad-hoc exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.494" offset="14269962">And the reference to prosecutorial discretion that there should be faith that the government will only prosecute, I guess, what the government regards as exceptional cases is not something that can provide any business involved in an international transaction with any... with any comfort.</text>
