            <text syncTime="6.572" offset="26227">The case is Kansas versus Colorado, maybe I should say the most recent chapter in that long, ongoing saga, is an original action between Kansas and Colorado about the division of the waters of the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.004" offset="87980">The river begins in the Rockies; it goes across farmland in eastern Colorado in Kansas and it end up in the Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.938" offset="123716">In the 19th century, there were journalists who called it the Nile of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.290" offset="141061">I guess they thought it was fertile and in the 20th century it has been a fertile source of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.866" offset="167393">In 1985, Kansas said Colorado had violated an interstate compact by taking too much water for irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.406" offset="201561">We appointed a Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.958" offset="211801">The Special Master agreed with Kansas and we did too.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.230" offset="228833">And it went back to the master who calculated damages and he came up with various conclusion and we agreed with him again except for one matter having to do with how you calculate pre-judgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.249" offset="280973">He wanted to set that running as of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.238" offset="292885">We said it should run beginning in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.429" offset="305633">Now, we sent it back again and there is more issues that he determined and Kansas has made six objections to those issues and we overrule all of those objections today except the Special Master’s recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.847" offset="367386">First, Kansas asked us to appoint, I will summarize them very briefly, asked us to appoint a river master to decide various further technical disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.396" offset="401554">We looked at the nature of the disputes and thought in light of their policy as well as technological mix, we would deny the request for a Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.798" offset="439171">Then Kansas wanted us to calculate the post 1985, remember pre-judgment interest started in 1985, but Kansas says yes it does start then but it should be calculated on the amounts that were pre-85 as well as post-85.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.208" offset="520777">We looked at our last decision, we looked at the Special Master’s analysis of how we got there and we concluded that the amounts that are pre-85 should also be exempt from pre-judgment interest and so the whole begins on ’85 and after ’85 amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.010" offset="583993">Then Kansas pointed out that the damages rest on the use of a very, very complicated hydrological institutional model.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.836" offset="627252">It is called the HI model.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.276" offset="633104">I will spare you the details but it tries to measure every drop of water that comes into Kansas and that goes out that is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.389" offset="661525">Rain, everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.668" offset="670616">Then they worked with the model and they tried to figure out how much of it is really attributable to the Colorado digging too much which they were not supposed to dig too many wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.720" offset="714815">Kansas says in the future, look at the results year by year.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.517" offset="729966">But the Special Master said if we do that, it is going to be too erroneous because the model is only accurate if you look at 10-years batches.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.090" offset="760268">But we said All right; that is what we think is true, that is what they should do, 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.089" offset="776255">Now, Kansas raises three more matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.304" offset="785136">They are still more technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.599" offset="794331">I won't go into them but for reasons that we set forth in the opinion, we agree in each instance with the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.914" offset="819618">Finally, we note that the Special Master recommended the use of consultation, mediations and arbitration in respect to future disputes which in the master’s view are likely to be very technical in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.519" offset="874057">Noting our argument today, we would drink to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.745" offset="894955">Kansas' exceptions are overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.245" offset="908957">The Special Master’s recommendations are adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.434" offset="921704">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
