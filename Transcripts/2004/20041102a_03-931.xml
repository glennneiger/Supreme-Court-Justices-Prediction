            <text syncTime="6.482" offset="25913">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.502" offset="53917">When experienced counsel thoroughly investigates, prepares for trial, and discusses his trial strategy with his client, a challenge for effectiveness may not presume prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.200" offset="92787">Rather, this Court's two-part inquiry, articulated in Strickland v. Washington, is the proper measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.568" offset="114207">The Florida Supreme Court erred in its decision below for three main reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.654" offset="130612">First, they failed to apply Strickland's two-part circumstance-specific, performance prejudice inquiry to a question of trial strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.373" offset="161437">Second, it improperly presumed prejudice under this Court's decision in United States v. Cronic where there was neither a complete denial of counsel, nor did counsel entirely fail to subject the State's case to meaningful adversarial testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.393" offset="213473">Third, the Florida Supreme Court improperly expanded this Court's decision in Boykin v. Alabama from governing pleas of guilt to governing tactical decisions made during full-fledged trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.977" offset="259866">For these three reasons and because the Florida court's decision conflicts with Strickland and its progeny and will disrupt the effective administration of justice, we request reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="89.414" offset="357564">Mr. Corin, after speaking to his client on three occasions about this trial strategy, sought to concede the underlying... the underlying crimes but to argue what was the most essential part of this case, and that was whether or not death should be the outcome of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.333" offset="553273">They waive the right to have a jury, to confront witnesses, to cross examine, all of the attendant trial rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.790" offset="643135">It could be because that was probably the weakest of the seven confessions and perhaps he wanted the jury to hear that that confession was weak.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.816" offset="4951249">In some situations, if you're not following the defendant's instructions, it can lead to such a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship that you couldn't possibly render effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.622" offset="4998478">So it is going to be a factor in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.223" offset="5008823">But this case presents only the question of what happens when there's no objection, and when there's no objection, it makes no sense to say that where there's been consultation, no objection, that instead of allowing the lawyer to exercise his reasonable judgment on what the best thing to do is, he instead has to pursue an alternative reasonable doubt strategy that is less effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.174" offset="5100669">And the Sixth Amendment simply can't be read to require counsel to pursue a less effective strategy that the defendant hasn't asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.340" offset="5137345">Now, there's no perfect analogy here, but the closest analogy is to the division of responsibilities for appeal where the defendant has the right to say whether he will appeal, but counsel has the right primarily to make the strategic judgments of what arguments will be raised on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.682" offset="5210697">So too here, the... the defendant has the right to decide to stand trial, but client has primary responsibility for making the strategic judgment of what defenses will be raised at that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.753" offset="5262942">Now, there is... this is an important question, and therefore there is a duty on the part of counsel to consult with the defendant, but once that consultation has occurred, and there is no objection, and the choice that counsel made is a reasonable, tactical judgment under all the facts and circumstances, his pursuit of that strategy satisfies constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.044" offset="5352176">There is no requirement of explicit, affirmative consent, and the Florida Supreme Court's judgment should, therefore, be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.434" offset="11765656">So, in conclusion, Your Honors, we submit that there are two... two approaches to affirming the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.757" offset="11823020">First is... is that it was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.298" offset="11841097">The second is that because of the nature of the statements, it was a complete failure of the advocacy process where the State's case was not tested in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.899" offset="11887595">In fact, as I mentioned, there were 35 witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.621" offset="11898462">There were five very perfunctory questions asked such as what date was it and when did certain things occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.103" offset="11924376">There was not the material testing of the record to determine the truth, which is what is... is involved in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.134" offset="11964500">And none of... none of the challenges, that are pointed out in... to the facts in our brief ever came out because that there was no testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.228" offset="12012878">Simply we have an opening statement where counsel says the State will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these events occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.196" offset="12044748">Then we have virtually no cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.252" offset="12056973">We have no witnesses called by the State... excuse me... by... by the defendant throughout the entire guilt phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.311" offset="12085185">And in fact, at one point, the... the trial judge stopped asking... asking Mr. Corin if he wished to cross examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.606" offset="12118413">And then we have the closing statement where Mr. Corin stated that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that... that he is... Mr. Nixon was guilty of the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.767" offset="12163030">And all the while during that guilt phase, Mr. Nixon was not present in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.605" offset="12190407">So he had no ability to object to the opening or the closing statements because he wasn't here... there to hear them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.250" offset="12224993">And further, as... as the record indicates, there are issues of... of Mr. Nixon's competency, that he's mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.358" offset="12277342">His own lawyer referred to him as nuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.671" offset="12286642">His own lawyer also referred to him as an ogre in his closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.122" offset="12308480">These are the types of statements, we would submit, are... even if they are not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent, they... they substantially and completely destroy the advocacy process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.485" offset="12373891">So there is no testing, and under Cronic, the Court should affirm also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.860" offset="12391340">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.603" offset="12430315">I'd like to point this Court to page 486 of the joint appendix where Mr. Corin is asked, do you feel in this case that you were put in a position that you had to make decisions because your client did nothing?</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.135" offset="12480470">And he said, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.455" offset="12485799">There is ample evidence in the post-trial proceedings that Mr. Corin wanted the help of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.277" offset="12509100">He did not want to be on the bridge of the ship alone, but Mr. Nixon abandoned the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.569" offset="12526237">And although he consulted with his client at least three times on this trial strategy, there was no input back that would have given him any reason to believe that Mr. Nixon did not want him to go forward to pursue a strategy that Mr. Corin, in his experience of 14 years as a lawyer, after having taken 52 depositions in this case, believed was in the best interest of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.541" offset="12610142">I just have a couple of points I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.686" offset="12618710">There was a question that was asked about whether or not the... the guilt phase and the penalty phase are distinct parts of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.343" offset="12641280">This Court has addressed that in the Monj v. California case when it said that it's really one trial and that issues of guilt and innocence are often, in a capital trial, still being determined in the penalty phase of that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.179" offset="12692689">I'd also like to mention the point that the counsel made about Cronic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.480" offset="12713900">Counsel would ask, as the Florida Supreme Court did, to apply Cronic to this situation.</text>
