            <text syncTime="2783.337" offset="11133283">The Ten Commandments have undeniable religious significance, but they also have secular significance as a code of law and as a well recognized historical symbol of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.143" offset="11180513">When a State decides to display a Ten Commandments display along with more than a dozen other monuments on its Capitol grounds in order to honor the donor, it is not endorsing the religious text of the Ten Commandments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.375" offset="11241430">And in the same way, when a state has that monument as part of such a collection, the Establishment Clause should not be interpreted to force them to send a message of hostility to religion by singling out that one monument for removal solely because of its religious content.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.094" offset="11308304">Can I ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.438" offset="11321678">As I understand it, it's the Protestant version basically of the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has significant differences from the Catholic version and the Jewish version.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.347" offset="11361384">And I understand it was the result of consultation and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.145" offset="11376536">But I noticed in your brief, you list the States in which the Ten Commandments displays are listed, there is none for Rhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a Catholic state, and the only one from Massachusetts is a frieze on the north wall of the public library which apparently didn't have the text of the commandments in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.297" offset="11453127">Is there any significance to the fact that this kind of display may be more popular in areas of the country where the Protestant religion is dominant as opposed to other versions of Christian religions?</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.186" offset="11500669">Justice Stevens, I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.128" offset="11508506">I mean, we didn't purport to do an exhaustive survey, but I think there is a well represented group of displays throughout the country including, I think, in States that probably have relatively high Catholic populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.388" offset="11557512">But I think we would steer this Court away from attributing too much significance to the fact that if a State is going to display the Ten Commandments at all, it will necessarily have to display a version that reflects one or another sect's preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.505" offset="11613936">In the Marsh case, for example, this Court upheld legislative prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.971" offset="11627833">It understood that they would necessarily have to choose a chaplain and that chaplain would necessarily be of one denomination or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.195" offset="11656777">And this Court didn't doom the whole practice of legislative prayer because of the necessity of picking a chaplain of one denomination or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.254" offset="11684989">In fact, in the Marsh case itself, this court upheld Nebraska's practice, even though they had chosen the same Presbyterian minister for 16 straight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.305" offset="11721143">And so I don't think this Court in other Establishment Clause contexts has steered away from putting the States and municipalities in a catch 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.273" offset="11753012">And given that this Court has suggested even in Stone against Graham that the Ten Commandments can be displayed, can be used in certain settings, it can't be that once the State in practice picks a particular version, it's all of a sudden guilty of a sectarian preference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2982.029" offset="11928033">I'm not sure, though, that a display that actually has Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God is any less religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.799" offset="11955096">I would suggest that's actually more religious than one that just displays the monument standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.258" offset="11972963">If the monuments are standing alone, you can I think appreciate the fact that maybe they're being displayed for their secular significance as well as their religious significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.803" offset="12007131">When Moses is there, it's hard to avoid the implication that they are the revealed law of God, as opposed to also a secular code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.787" offset="12039105">So in that sense, I'm not sure that the variations in the display take away from the fact that there is religious content--</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.441" offset="12865724">I mean, we think, for example, it cannot be that the very fact that moving it closer to the courthouse itself is a constitutional problem because as you yourself have pointed out, Justice Kennedy, the legislative prayers that were approved in Marsh v. Chambers were at the absolute epicenter of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.704" offset="12930717">And still those were a permissible acknowledgment of religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.193" offset="13024758">And I don't think that the Constitution puts the municipalities and the States in the bind of being able to display the Ten Commandments in theory, but in fact, not being able to pick any one version--</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.844" offset="13175327">The idea that in order to have the Ten Commandments monument on the Capitol grounds, the State of Texas has to cordon that monument off, unlike any other of the 17 monuments, suggests a hostility to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.340" offset="13229349">I think the idea that there has to be a fence away from the Ten Commandments to make clear that the State has nothing to do with the Ten Commandments is bending over too far in the other direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.000" offset="13267905">The State can have, as this Court has acknowledged many times, permissible acknowledgments of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.111" offset="13292356">And I don't think in this case that the State of Texas has gone too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.909" offset="13307611">One other point I think that is important to put on the table, and it is consistent with the analysis of both the district court and the Fifth Circuit, is that whatever the original purpose is for Texas accepting the monument and displaying it in the first instance, they now have an additional secular purpose in retaining the monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.675" offset="13378664">And I would point this Court to Judge Becker's analysis in the Chester County case for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.315" offset="13401234">In that case, he had a display that was admittedly smaller, but it was actually a much more overtly sectarian version of the Ten Commandments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.291" offset="13429133">It had the Ten Commandments plus the summary of the Ten Commandments from the New Testament.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.408" offset="13449613">And nonetheless, Judge Becker said that in that case, the monument had been there since 1920 and Chester County had a legitimate secular purpose in maintaining that document and maintaining the plaque on the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.957" offset="13499768">And I think he correctly understood that in these cases of displays that have stood for 40 years or longer, that the State is in something of a dilemma.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.154" offset="13576568">First, is the Ten Commandments a highly religious message.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.362" offset="13593391">And second, can the government place a single religious message on government property at the seat of its government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.217" offset="13620767">As to the first question, Stone v. Graham resolves this because this Court said that the Ten Commandments is an inherently religious message no matter what disclaimer accompanies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.892" offset="13659533">The Ten Commandments is not on the Texas State Capitol grounds simply to recognize the role of religion in government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.837" offset="13683252">It is not simply an acknowledgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.800" offset="13691193">It is sacred text taken directly from the Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.400" offset="13701538">It's not there about the history of religion in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.372" offset="13713450">There is nothing to tell the reasonable observer that it is there for historical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.542" offset="13730168">What about all the other religions that have played a role in Texas history?</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.796" offset="13747096">The Mojave religion, even Madeleine Murray O'Hare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.890" offset="13759530">Is Texas saying they would accept statues for all of these individuals there as part of the history of Texas?</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.462" offset="13781786">The second question is, can the government place a single religious message by itself on government property, especially at the seat of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.902" offset="13815536">The County of Allegheny case resolves that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.858" offset="13827344">This is much like the nativity scene at the seat of the county government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.066" offset="13844167">What's important and hasn't gotten enough emphasis this morning, this is the sole religious message anywhere on the Texas State Capitol grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.149" offset="13880529">This isn't a museum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.642" offset="13918563">Texas put this there precisely to express the religious message.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.812" offset="13935177">Your Honors, what's left of the Establishment Clause if any item can be displayed with the most profound religious contents?</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.274" offset="13969032">Do we then say the observer can just avert his or her eyes?</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.239" offset="13984914">The observer could have averted his or her eyes in the County of Allegheny case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.037" offset="14000065">But this Court was clear in saying that a single religious message, a single religious symbol on government property is inherently an establishment of religion.</text>
