          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="15.111" stopTime="161.572">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="15.111" offset="60395">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.576" offset="74292">This case, and these cases, concern the constitutionality of the twelve hundred criminal sentencings that take place in Federal court each week.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.197" offset="112744">If this Court re-affirms its traditional understanding of the relationship between the Guidelines, and the statutory maximum penalties set forth in the United States Code, an understanding reflected in a series of this Court's decisions dealing with the Guidelines, than the constitutionality of those criminal sentencings remains secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.381" offset="193515">On the other hand, if this Court takes a different view, and treats the outer bounds of the Guideline ranges as if they were statutory maximums, then the majority of those criminal sentencings become constitutionally dubious, and this Court must confront difficult remedial issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.842" offset="263314">This is, of course, not the first time that this Court has confronted a challenge to the constitutionality of the Guidelines or to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.068" offset="292258">To be sure, in those previous cases, this Court has never considered the precise Sixth Amendment issue before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.431" offset="321724">But, nonetheless, those previous cases are instructive, because all of those cases, Dunnigan, Witte, Watts, and Edwards, all reflect a particular understanding of the relationship between the Guidelines and the statutory maximum sentences for each specific crime defined in the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.493" offset="401972">And all of those decisions suggest that the statutory maximum in the Code is the relevant focal point for constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.567" offset="434260">So, in the Witte case, for example, the finding of relevant conduct in the Witte case increased his sentence under the Guidelines by two hundred months.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.226" offset="472816">Nonetheless, this Court rejected the double jeopardy challenge before the Court by emphasizing that that consideration of relevant conduct did not increase his penalty beyond the statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.146" offset="524539">Likewise in the Edwards case, this Court considered the propriety of a judicial finding of crack cocaine that increased the Guideline sentence, when the jury was instructed in the alternative, to find cocaine or crack.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.944" offset="575739">Now, even though the judicial finding had the effect of raising the punishment under the Guidelines, this Court found no serious Sixth Amendment issue raised precisely because the effect of the judge's finding did not take the sentence beyond the maximum for that cocaine-only conspiracy.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="161.572" offset="646269">And you say we found no serious Sixth Amendment issue raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.478" offset="657868">Was the right of jury trial issue argued in that case, and decided?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="168.381" offset="673437">In the Edwards case, a Sixth Amendment issue and, I think, fairly including the jury trial, was raised in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.152" offset="700604">Now, I tried to go back and look briefs in that case and I have to admit, they're a little difficult to get through in terms of the precise issue that was being raised.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="184.274" stopTime="191.704">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="184.274" offset="737071">The right to jury trial is fairly clear and stark, and I guess don't recall that being argued in any of those cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="191.704" stopTime="231.334">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="191.704" offset="766746">Well, it was argued, I think, fairly clearly in the Watts case, I mean, there was a section... Watts, of course, was a summary reversal, so you have to go and look at the brief in opposition in the Watts case.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.175" offset="804676">And if you do, there's a separate paragraph in the arguments section denominated the jury trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.905" offset="823589">And I think in some respects, the Watts case is a particularly clear indicator that this Court has rejected the view of the Guidelines that Respondents embrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.533" offset="858070">Because Justice Stevens was quite prophetic in his dissent in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.536" offset="874057">He embraced the precise understanding of the significance of the outer bound of the Guidelines range in his Watts dissent, and no member of this Court joined that dissent, and no member found the disposition with respect to Watts--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="231.334" stopTime="233.108">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="231.334" offset="925257">That just proves they don't listen to me as much as they should.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="233.108" stopTime="295.995">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="233.108" offset="932362">--It may very well prove that, Justice Stevens, because you were very clear about the point, just to remind you, in the Watts case there were two cases before the Court, there was the Putra case, and there was the Watts case, they were consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.823" offset="983249">And with respect to Putra, you can envision that case, or characterize that case as being sort of a collateral estoppel, double jeopardy case, but as you correctly recognized, very clearly, in your Watts dissent, with respect to Mr. Watts, the finding, the criminal finding of acquittal was based on 924(c), which requires use of a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.976" offset="1059840">The sentencing enhancement was done based on an enhancing factor that only requires possession of a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.549" offset="1082096">So there wasn't any collateral estoppel effect in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.687" offset="1094740">But, nonetheless, in your dissent you pointed out, in footnotes 2 and 4 that it still had the effect of raising his sentence above the outer bound of the Guidelines range, and that, because that was done on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence, rather than a beyond a reasonable doubt standard, that that raised a constitutional problem, and you would have reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.377" offset="1173420">The rest of the Court was happy to summarily reverse in that case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="295.995" stopTime="370.570">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="295.995" offset="1183974">Mr. Clement, here's the problem I have with the Government's argument insofar as it does not urge that we reverse Blakely, I know that you want us to do that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.967" offset="1231830">But assuming we adhere to Blakely, it seems to me you have a cure that doesn't correspond to the disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.297" offset="1261087">You say that the reason the right to jury trial does not apply here is because, after all, these sentences have not been prescribed, or these maximums have not been prescribed by the legislature, but rather, have been prescribed by a quasi-judicial agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.565" offset="1342171">But the right of jury trial is meant to protect against whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="341.509" offset="1365995">Who are you worried about when you say,</text>
            <text syncTime="343.078" offset="1372264">"I want to be tried by a jury. "</text>
            <text syncTime="344.936" offset="1379683">You're not worried about the legislature, you're worried about the judges, precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.196" offset="1392744">So I don't care if the upper level of the Guidelines were actually prescribed by a court, as opposed to the Commission which is, I don't know what it is, but it's not a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.342" offset="1437362">But even if it were prescribed by a court, how would that eliminate the jury trial problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="367.144" offset="1468500">The whole reason for jury trial is we don't trust judges.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="370.570" stopTime="401.489">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="370.570" offset="1482188">With respect, Justice Scalia, I'd like to make two observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.997" offset="1495980">One, I don't think the jury trial right is just a juxtaposition of the role of the jury versus the role of the judge, because if that were the only factor at issue in this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, it would be very difficult to explain why it is that judicial fact-finding can have the effects that it can under a purely discretionary system, yet this Court has upheld that time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.629" offset="1582498">The second point I'd like to make, is I do think that this Court's Apprendi to Blakely line of cases--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="401.489" stopTime="442.728">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="401.489" offset="1605904">Can we just go back to the point you just made, it's a little different when the judge has discretion and there's no... the judge has discretion to take a whole bunch of things into account, but they're not quantified.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.577" offset="1658253">And I think that was dramatically illustrated, the difference, by the decision of Judge Lynch when he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="421.347" offset="1685316">"Well, I'll go back to the old ways of doing it, I'll look at the Guidelines for some advice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="426.465" offset="1705796">he comes out with twenty-four months instead of thirty-three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.302" offset="1721156">So I think there is a huge difference between a judge taking account of many, many factors, not giving them a specific quantity as the Guidelines require.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="442.728" stopTime="481.079">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="442.728" offset="1770893">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think there... there certainly is a difference between sentencing under the Guidelines, versus a system of discretionary sentencing, or even a system of discretionary sentencing where the Guidelines have an advisory character, I'd certainly concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.391" offset="1825541">My point was, though, in making a distinction between the role of the jury and the judge, it's not just as simple as saying that the jury trial right exists precisely to protect the jury from the judge, because if that were the case, the kind of fact-finding that Judge Lynch engaged in, or the kind of fact finding that was commonplace under discretionary sentencing also takes roles away from the jury, and gives them to the judge.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="481.079" stopTime="533.584">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="481.079" offset="1924284">Yes, but we're talking here about one precise role of the judge or of the jury, and that is, to find a fact that is necessary to keep you in jail for an additional number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.050" offset="1972140">And the difference with discretionary sentencing is if it's, you know, ten to twenty years, what you know when you do the crime is that you've laid yourself open to twenty years.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.789" offset="2019056">Now, if you get a merciful judge, good for you, I mean, that's lagniappe as they say in Louisiana, but if you get a hanging judge, you've got twenty years, and you know that when you commit the crime, whereas we have a system now where you entitled to no more than so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.210" offset="2080810">And I find it just incompatible with a jury trial right to say that that fact must be determined, before you can be kept in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.716" offset="2114769">And yet we're going let it be determined by a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.407" offset="2121561">That bears no resemblance to the discretionary sentencing system.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="533.584" offset="2134309">With respect, Justice Scalia, I think you've built in some assumptions into that question, because under our system, generally speaking if somebody wants to know what the maximum exposure for a particular criminal offense is, they would be well-advised to look at the U.S. Code provision that specifies what the maximum sentence is for that offense, because that is their exposure, that's what they're told about in their Rule colloquy if they plead to the crime, and if the judge makes certain findings, to be sure, upward departure, whatever it takes in a particular case, that is the maximum exposure that the individual--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="566.156" offset="2264607">It's not the maximum exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.649" offset="2266593">If, for example, one of the factors is whether the crime was committed with a firearm, I know that if I don't use a firearm, under the Guidelines, I can only get so many years, so somebody has to find that I used a firearm, and if I didn't, my maximum exposure is less.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.469" offset="2397832">But if there's no mistake, and no departure on some of the grounds, we both understand, I think, how the Guidelines work and you're describing it correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.065" offset="2428238">But still, that is a finding that is only necessary because of the determination of the Commission and the Guidelines, and that brings us back to the question--</text>

            <text syncTime="628.242" offset="2512875">Then the distinction that you're making between the maximum set by the legislature and the guidance provided, or the guidance to discretion under the Guidelines, really doesn't stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.897" offset="2571494">So at least to the extent that Congress directly enacts Guidelines, would you concede that then, the critical finding has to be made by the jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="671.588" offset="2686328">The reason I would say that even in that case there is a difference is because it is still different when Congress goes in and amends a particular Guideline in a sense in a sea of Guidelines provided by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.476" offset="2733871">And I think that's true, one, because amending a single Guideline doesn't change the overall character of the Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.421" offset="2757590">But also because, when Congress decides to take action not as a statute, but as an amendment to a Guideline, it doesn't change the fundamental character of the Guideline as a Guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.535" offset="2798132">And so after... the Protect Act for example, specifies a period in which... after which the Commission can then amend that Guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.761" offset="2826971">Which is obviously not a case that you can have with a statute consistent with the Presentment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.507" offset="2845989">And to just give you another example, the Sentencing Reform Act that has brought us here today, one of the things it did was make specific amendments to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.812" offset="2883187">I think when Congress does that, it doesn't make Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 a statute, it continues to be a Federal Rule, the Federal Rules Advisory Committee can still modify it after the fact, and so I think even in that case, there's a difference in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.976" offset="9283814">The first is the vast amount of information now and prior to guidelines that were contained in the presentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.232" offset="9316833">That information, most of which was used since history was begun, maybe a hundred years ago, is simply not available until the trial was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.437" offset="9353718">The second happens to be the things that the Chief brought up, matters committed at trial, such as perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.375" offset="9381407">The third sort of thing are those things that just get too complicated when you try to list in indictment, such as victim... put them all together... victim, brandishing the gun, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.864" offset="9439399">And the fourth kind of thing are the things that are too difficult to explain to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.187" offset="9460715">Try explaining even "brandishing" to a jury, and if you can do that one, which may be easy, try the multiple-count rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2599.206" offset="10396735">First of all, you're exactly right, since 1812 we've abandoned a system where judges can define the elements of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.182" offset="10424633">And that's why, if I leave you with one thought on the remedy, I would think that it's inappropriate to allow an entity within the judicial branch to have that effect on a prospective basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.011" offset="10480013">I think it would dwarf the separation of powers problem that at least you found quite significant in the Mistretta case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.501" offset="10501956">Now, if I can address Justice Kennedy's question about the appeals system simply replicating the Apprendi or the Blakely problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.354" offset="10529332">First of all, we would suggest that the appeal process that you've envisioned would not violate Apprendi and Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.868" offset="10559425">And that's one of the reasons that we think the Commission wouldn't violate Blakely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.389" offset="12465528">And I think, as the judge in that case said, one of the things that comes up in virtually every guidelines case is the issue of relevant conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.985" offset="12495935">Now, that is a very, very difficult thing to try to instruct the jury on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.784" offset="12511086">The application notes that the Commission itself have come up in span eight and a half pages of very small, single spaced text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.708" offset="12542746">To try to give that as jury instructions, I think, would leave the jury completely bewildered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.249" offset="12560927">Then, you'd also, though, even if you could get past the instruction problems, the effect of considering relevant conduct is going to have a transformative effect on what goes before the jury, because relevant conduct asks the jury not to focus on the elements of the specific crime; the relevant conduct focuses on the other acts of that individual defendant and, if there's joint criminal, if there's a joint criminal undertaking, the reasonably foreseeable events of acts of others taken in furtherance of the joint undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.599" offset="12678374">Now, the effect of using that guideline, designed for judges, and sending it to the jury, is effectively to transform many, many cases from individual defendant cases to scheme cases or conspiracy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.776" offset="12727066">So in tallying up the carnage and the wreckage of applying these guidelines designed clearly for judge fact-finding and willy... nilly sending them to the jury, I think you have to include the confusion and the difficulty of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4849.771" offset="19399053">, is that 97 percent of the cases are handled through plea bargaining, and this will give you a little bit of a leg up, which I speculated the defense bar likes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4886.013" offset="19543980">The prosecutor charges the easiest crime to prove that he can prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.350" offset="19561326">There is no effective plea bargaining in most of those cases because the prosecutor knows he's going to win that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.037" offset="19588075">So the defendant pleads guilty because he doesn't want to lose his, his reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.383" offset="19617437">I think what changes is probably if our proposal is accepted, that there is more meaningful negotiation and that prosecutors and defense attorney's will come to an understand in most cases of what sentencing facts are provable, and what are not, and cases will continue to plead out much the same as they do right now, except more effectively because we eliminate the problem of the prosecutor being able to prove the easiest charge and save the heart of the case for sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4963.911" offset="19855569">The Government conceded as much in their brief to this Court in Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.164" offset="19872601">When they filed an amicus brief in Blakely they told this Court, or they urged this Court not to invalidate the Washington State Guidelines because, they told this Court, if you do, they are so similar to the Federal Guidelines that the Federal Guidelines will fall as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.191" offset="19932682">And here they are, less than five months later, standing before the same Court, saying something completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.455" offset="19961731">Now, it's not that they're so similar to the Washington State Guidelines, but that they're completely different, and that they don't operate in the same manner at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.000" offset="19995899">And what it comes down to is that for Sixth Amendment purposes, the source of the law doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.076" offset="20024216">The Government got it right when they filed their amicus brief in Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.941" offset="20039680">It doesn't matter to a defendant whether or not the source of the law is legislative, or the source of the law is by commission or regulatory body.</text>

            <text syncTime="6251.089" offset="25004304">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.439" offset="23945718">This Court in Mistretta expressed its understanding that the commission was constitutional because it would pursue traditional judicial tasks related to sentencing, and it would not get involved in quintessentially legislative acts of setting maximum penalties, or defining the elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6005.098" offset="24020323">Now, we of course, think that's quite relevant for the Sixth Amendment issue that's raised in question one; but even if you disagree with us on that, even if you think the non-legislative origins of the guidelines don't matter for purposes of question one, surely they do matter for purposes of the severability analysis under question two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.674" offset="24094616">Because if one takes those elements, those enhancement factors in the guidelines, and treats them like true elements of crimes that must go to the jury, then you are giving this non-legislative body's work product the effect of Federal criminal statutes, and that's something that not only Mistretta suggests is problematic, but United States v. Hudson in 18 suggests is problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.542" offset="24186149">And the effect is really breathtaking; it is an understatement to say that the effect of that judicial remedial decision would be to create thousands of new Federal crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.111" offset="24228362">Now, let me talk just for a second about the language of severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6061.114" offset="24244454">There's been some questions about whether what we're really talking about is severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.336" offset="24257306">First of all you're going to have some cases where there's going to be no enhancing factor at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.198" offset="24280712">And in those cases you don't need to talk about severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.374" offset="24293460">If there's no Sixth Amendment issue raised in a case, there's no reason to strike anything down and that would be a simple matter of traditional principles of third party standing and facial challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="6084.027" offset="24336091">The fact that you might have a constitutional problem in this case, doesn't mean that you invalidate the guidelines in those other cases, where they apply without problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6091.867" offset="24367438">The real question becomes, what do you do in a case where there is a Sixth Amendment problem, assuming Blakely applies to the guidelines?</text>
            <text syncTime="6099.176" offset="24396696">At that point, I think severability is the right way to talk about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.520" offset="24410070">One way of dealing with the case at the point you recognize there's a Sixth Amendment problem in this case is to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="6108.009" offset="24432013">"Well, there's nothing we can do about it, we can't sentence this individual to any more than the upper bound of the sentencing range. "</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.749" offset="24454896">The second thing you can do is you can say,</text>
            <text syncTime="6116.016" offset="24463987">"Well, okay, there's a constitutional problem, but the result is that we sever 3553(b), we don't make the guidelines mandatory, and we allow the judge to impose a discretionary sentence within the range of the statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="6131.210" offset="24524800">That is what we think is the appropriate solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.689" offset="24534727">As a couple of you have mentioned, what we may be talking about here is an interim solution anyway as Congress may well get involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.664" offset="24562625">That's why in considering what regime of remediability or severability best serves the interests of Congress in uniformity and proportionality, it pays to pay particular attention to the cases that are in the pipeline now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.751" offset="24614975">And on those cases, there's no question which proposal better serves the interest of uniformity and proportionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.611" offset="24638380">Respondents have to admit that they are seeking a huge sentencing windfall here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6164.441" offset="24657711">One other point that bears mention is this idea of, the suggestion that because the guidelines will not be binding in every case, the Government somehow controls the decision as to whether or not it's a guidelines case or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.990" offset="24707866">That is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.021" offset="24712046">That decision under the system will rest with the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6181.448" offset="24725734">If there is an enhancement sought, but it's not found in the basis of the judge, then there's no Sixth Amendment problem in that case, and the case can go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="6188.878" offset="24755409">The irony, of course, is that the consequence of applying Blakely to the guidelines is to create more power with the prosecutor, because as Justice Breyer pointed out, under the current system of the guidelines, the prosecutor cannot control through the indictment exactly what sentencing factors the judge will consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="6206.628" offset="24826462">The Burns case, for example, that this Court had involved a case in where the judge sua sponte took notice of sentencing factors that neither the prosecutor nor the defendant very much wanted in front of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6216.825" offset="24867213">That will no longer be possible under a system where everything has to be in the indictment, so the result is to strengthen the hand of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.801" offset="24895112">The last thing is this idea of bifurcation is not a panacea.</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.888" offset="24911517">I know Justice Scalia, you've thrown that out in a number of instances, but the traditional rule in cases with real elements of real Federal crimes is that you don't get to bifurcate out one element that the defendant doesn't want to put before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.065" offset="24960209">That's the, that's the binding law in cases like Collamore out of the First Circuit and Barker out of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6246.092" offset="24984346">So, I think it's wrong to suggest that, that bifurcation is going to solve all these problems.</text>
