            <text syncTime="82.931" offset="331651">This Court held more than 100 years ago in Nishimura Ekiu that the power of a nation to forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions is inherent in sovereignty and is central to self-preservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.018" offset="384000">If it were otherwise, the integrity of the Nation's borders and its security would be at the mercy of a foreign power who might choose to foist aliens onto our country or to the self-help efforts of aliens who might leave another country coming to our shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.690" offset="442723">The migration crises involving Haitians and Cubans over the last 35 years vividly illustrate the adverse consequences of such a regime, and events of recent years confirm that the threats to the Nation's borders and security are not limited to nearby nations.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.730" offset="862877">It is written entirely in terms of the discretion of the Attorney General, now the Secretary of Homeland Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.386" offset="885447">It says the Attorney... the Secretary may, in his discretion, temporarily under conditions that he prescribes and for urgent and humanitarian reasons, parole an alien into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.594" offset="938318">But it says that parole does not constitute an admission, and it may be revoked at any time when the Secretary in his opinion concludes that the purposes of the parole have been satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.621" offset="9918380">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.092" offset="9956310">I think that we have lost sight of the statutory scheme that applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.754" offset="9975014">Section 1182(d)(5)(A) is not a detention statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.415" offset="9989642">It's clearly not preserved as an initial matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.766" offset="9999047">It was not in the answer to either habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.616" offset="10010436">The justification given in the district court in both cases was 1231(a)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.196" offset="10028722">But, Justice Breyer, there is no need to remand this case because a clear, simple reading of the immigration statutes demonstrates that 1182 is not a detention statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.310" offset="10069159">You have to go through the process, and I attempted to do this in my reply brief, but I think I can do it a little bit more clearly for the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.286" offset="10097058">When an alien first arrives, he's an applicant for admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.880" offset="10111478">Section 1225(b)(2)(A) of title 8, United States Code says an applicant for admission... any applicant for admission shall be detained until the removal proceeding unless it is clear, beyond any doubt, that they are entitled to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.855" offset="10175321">So all aliens, when they apply... that's the detention statute that initially applies, 1225(b)(2)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.747" offset="10202906">They are to be detained until there is a removal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.719" offset="10214818">The removal proceeding, which is governed by 1229(a)(1)... I'm sorry... 1226(a)... it is 1229(a)... is to determine whether the alien is admissible or not, whether they should come in or whether they must be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.194" offset="10268735">So 1225(b)(2)(A) says detain until that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.719" offset="10286811">1182(d)(5)(A) then comes in to authorize the Government to stop that process for humanitarian reasons and parole an alien in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.128" offset="10324428">We won't have the removal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.524" offset="10334041">We're going to... we... we're going to get out of the detention in 1225(b)(2)(A), and we're going to let you out on parole, which is discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.242" offset="10364865">That's 1182(d)(5)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.934" offset="10371657">If at any time, we in our discretion think it is no longer appropriate to keep you on parole, we can revoke that parole, and the statute 1182(d)(5)(A) says once parole is revoked, the alien is treated as, quote, any other applicant for admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.218" offset="10428813">So you go back to 1225(b)(2)(A), which says detain them until the removal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.596" offset="10534348">That's what they're being returned to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.876" offset="10539468">1225(b)(2)(A) is detention until the removal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.419" offset="10557649">And in the Demore v. Kim case, this case... this Court said that even if it's a long time and there aren't other procedures in place, you can be detained until your removal order is entered because... and... and the emphasis was there's an end date to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.658" offset="10614596">So there's an end date to detention under (b)(2)(A), 1225(b)(2)(A), and it's the removal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.481" offset="10637897">Section 1231 is the statute that governs removal and says, okay, now what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.432" offset="10657646">It says you have to remove within 90 days, but for certain aliens who've committed crimes or are inadmissible or are otherwise determined to be dangerous, we can detain them beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.001" offset="10699964">It says may be detained beyond the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.654" offset="10706547">That is the only statute that authorizes any detention of an alien after a removal order other than the specific terrorist statute, 1226(a), which was enacted, which does not authorize indefinite detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.778" offset="10759105">It says... it has a paragraph labeled indefinite detention, and it says the Government shall not indefinitely detain a terrorist alien that it cannot remove except that if the Government determines... and... and it appears to put the burden on the Government... that the person is a danger to national security or the community, it can detain them for another 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.826" offset="10835278">And then you... you could have indefinite detention, but each time, each 6 months, the statute provides for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.952" offset="10863804">So not only do the sneakers, the aliens who cross across the border in the... in the dark of night from Mexico or wherever... not only do they under the Government's own admission have the Zadvydas rights, so too do terrorist aliens by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.614" offset="10918452">And to suggest that by some implication Congress has intended to authorize the indefinite detention of people that we thought we should welcome into our country, even though we didn't have the ability under our quota system and under our current regulations in 1980 to let them in, somehow they have no rights against indefinite detention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.770" offset="13599033">And in fact, in the... in the Court's statutory analysis, it looked to the point that in the Witkovitz jurisdictional statement referring to Congress' constitutional doubts about detention of more than 6 months, those were constitutional doubts about people who were being deported after having been allowed to be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.171" offset="13712614">--It... with respect... with respect, it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.228" offset="13724839">And... and if I could... if I could explain this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.571" offset="13738214">This... going back to Mezei, this Court held and in fact rejected a very similar argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.009" offset="13764023">The rationale of the court of appeals in Mezei was that deportable aliens are subject to an express, not an implied, 6-month limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.234" offset="13792862">And the court of appeals said the aliens in that... the alien in that case, once he couldn't be removed to another country, should be released because the purpose of keeping him to return him to another country was no longer being served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.751" offset="13838942">This Court rejected that argument, even though there was a statutory express limitation of 6 months for deportable aliens, held that an alien who had been on Ellis Island for 2 years did not have to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.928" offset="13887634">In reliance on that decision, Congress passed the parole statute to leave the release in... excuse me... Mezei was after it, but the... the executive branch has relied on that rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.271" offset="13937058">The Cuban review regulations that are at issue here have been in place for 15 years under the parole statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.875" offset="13963494">As Congress well knew, when it acted in 1996, the... this program was the subject of many hearings in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.216" offset="13996826">There were cases... the Barrera case out of the Ninth Circuit sustained a 10-year detention of a Mariel Cuban.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.615" offset="14022426">It is implausible to believe in 1996, when Congress enacted IIRIRA, that it intended to cut back on the longstanding power of the executive branch to prevent hordes of aliens from coming into our country and to impose an arbitrary 6-month limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.590" offset="14086269">I... I think there's no argument that if an alien is detained before removal proceedings are begun, that there is no 6-month limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.339" offset="14121273">His release is entirely up to the Attorney General under the parole regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.269" offset="14141022">It's... it's implausible to believe that once Congress actually enters a formal order of exclusion or now removal against an alien, the person is no longer in an ambiguous situation, the executive branch says you're not eligible, that suddenly that person who has been formerly found not eligible, would be subject to a 6-month limitation that did not apply up until '96 and doesn't even apply until these... to these aliens until removal proceedings have been begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.610" offset="14254393">So the right way to look at this statute as what's a reasonable time under 1231(a)(6) has to take into account that historic background of the United States being able to protect its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.006" offset="14299951">And there is no indication whatsoever that Congress intended to overrule this longstanding program for Mariel Cubans, which has operated, as I said, for 15 years.</text>
