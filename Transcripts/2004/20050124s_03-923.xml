            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I also have an opinion to announce in 03-923, Illinois versus Caballes that was authored by Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.485" offset="49842">This is a case that comes to us from the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.438" offset="69695">In the opinion, authored by Justice Stevens, we answer a narrow question, whether the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable, articulable suspicion to justify using a drug detection dog to sniff a vehicle during a legitimate traffic stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.797" offset="147122">An Illinois state trooper stopped petitioner Caballes for speeding on an interstate highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.431" offset="173662">When the officer radioed the police dispatcher to report the traffic stop, a member of the State’s Drug Interdiction Team overheard the transmission and drove to the scene along with his narcotics-detection dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.596" offset="242312">On arrival and while the first trooper was writing the warning ticket for speeding, the drug interdiction officer walked the dog around Caballes’ car, the dog alerted at the trunk prompting the officers to open the trunk where they discovered marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.378" offset="321411">Caballes was arrested and charged with a narcotics offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.524" offset="338024">The trial judge denied the motion to suppress the seized evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.360" offset="357355">The court found no Fourth Amendment violation because the officers did not unnecessarily prolong the traffic stop in order to conduct the dog sniff and because the particular dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to establishe probable cause to search the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.468" offset="433842">The Illinois Supreme Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.843" offset="443350">In its view the use of a narcotics-detection cog converted the citizen police encounter from a lawful traffic stop into a drug investigation and because the shifting purpose was not supported by any reasonable suspicion of drug activity, it was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.395" offset="521509">We granted certiorari to review the Illinois Supreme Court’s holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.822" offset="539272">We now vacate and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.399" offset="549512">In our view, conducting a dog sniff would not change the character of a lawful traffic stop unless the dog sniffs itself infringed unconstitutionally protected privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.119" offset="600398">Our cases made clear that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.252" offset="612937">To fall within the purviews of the Fourth Amendment, police conduct must compromise a legitimate, interest in privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.549" offset="646165">Because a canine sniffs by a well-trained drug detection dog does not itself reveal noncontraband items and because any interest in possessing contraband cannot be deemed legitimate, the use of a properly trained drug detection dog during a lawful traffic stop will not generally implicate legitimate privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.158" offset="744594">In this case the traffic stop was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.070" offset="756193">It was not prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to issue a warning ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.821" offset="779180">In these circumstances, a dog sniff that only reveals the presence of the substance no individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.083" offset="824320">Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.236" offset="840934">The case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with the Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.865" offset="867370">Justice Ginsburg and Justice Souter have filed dissenting opinions.</text>
