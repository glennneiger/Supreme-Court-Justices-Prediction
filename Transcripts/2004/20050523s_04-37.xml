            <text syncTime="13.345" offset="53290">This case comes to us on a writ of a certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.466" offset="77845">Oklahoma has a semi closed primary in which a political party may invite only its own party members and registered independents to vote in that party's primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.953" offset="131762">During the 2000 election cycle the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma or LPO wanted to open its party primary to all registered Oklahoma voters regardless of their party affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.686" offset="190694">The State Election Board agreed as to independent voters but not as to voters registered with other political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.379" offset="225489">The LPO and several republican and democratic voters then brought this law suit alleging that Oklahoma's semi-closed primary system unconstitutionaly burdens their First Ammendment right to freedom of political association.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.476" offset="297900">The Court of Appeals agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.289" offset="305110">It concluded that the State's semi-closed primary system imposed a severe burden on associational rights and thus was constitutional only if the system was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.757" offset="366968">Finding none of Oklahoma's interest compelling the Court of Appeals enjoined Oklahoma from using its primary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.745" offset="402913">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.257" offset="433006">Electoral regulations are subject to strict scrutiny only if they impose severe burdens on associational rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.555" offset="466129">However, Oklahoma's semi closed primary system places a minor burden on parties and voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.784" offset="503118">Registered members of the republican, democratic, and reformed parties who wished to vote in the LPO primary need only file a form with the County Election Board Secretary to change their registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.484" offset="561842">With nominal effort they are able to vote in the LPO primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.456" offset="581799">For the same reason the LPO need only persuade voters to make the minimal effort necessary to switch parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.868" offset="615445">Oklahoma may impose such minor barriers between voter and party to serve important regulatory interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.869" offset="647419">Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system advances a number of important interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.662" offset="670616">It preserves political parties as viable and identifiable interest groups enhances parties electioneering and party building efforts and guards against party rating and soar loser candidacies by spurned primary contenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.188" offset="736653">In the face of such interest we have repeatedly upheld reasonable, non discriminatory regulations such as Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.695" offset="786704">Oklahoma remains free to allow the LPO to invite all registered voters, whatever their party affiliation to vote in their primary, but the Constitution leaves that choice to the citizens of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.133" offset="840516">Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which Justice Breyer joins in part; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Souter joins in part and Justice Ginsburg joins in full.</text>
