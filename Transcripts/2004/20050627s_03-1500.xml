            <text syncTime="6.341" offset="25287">The grounds of the Texas State Capitol include a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.795" offset="59141">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s finding that the monument is not contributing the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.112" offset="108356">We granted certiorari and now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.644" offset="122567">In an opinion joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, we hold that suppressive display of this monument with both the legacy and seculent significance does not violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.798" offset="211174">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.103" offset="224340">Justices Scalia and Thomas have filed concurring opinions; Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg has joined; Justice O’Connor has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.808" offset="343144">I did not know we had that many people on our court.</text>
