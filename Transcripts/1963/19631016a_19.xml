            <text syncTime="18.748" offset="178343">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.934" offset="211153">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Errors of the State of Connecticut to review a judgment of that court affirming the conviction of the petitioner in this case, Harold Fahy, of the offence of violating Section 53-45 of the General Statutes of Connecticut as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.889" offset="322957">That statute provides that any person who wilfully injures any public building or willfully places a bomb or other explosive device in any such building shall be fined not more than $5,000 or a prison not more than 20 years or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.149" offset="395995">I might say at the outset that the time this case was tried, there were two defendants, Mr. Fahy and Arnold.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.690" offset="434134">And as the Court may know, Mr. Arnold's petition was dismissed by the Court on its own motion before the petition for certiorari in the Fahy case was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.201" offset="484185">The facts in this case, if the Court please, are quite simple and a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.820" offset="514696">On February 1st 1960 at 4:30 in the morning, an officer of the Norwalk, Connecticut Police Department was conducting a routine patrol on a street in south Norwalk on which there was situated a Jewish House of Worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.329" offset="604662">He saw at that time four swastikas painted in black paint on this building.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.453" offset="633187">At the same time, another officer of the same department, Osborne Lindwall, was operating a patrol car a short distance from this house of worship and between that place and the home of the defendant Harold Fahy.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.653" offset="713958">Officer Lindwall noticing that the vehicle being operated by Fahy was operating without lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.410" offset="753037">He stopped the car and questions both of the boys, Mr. Fahy, the driver; Arnold, the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.699" offset="790131">During the course of this interrogation, the officer also made a check of the automobile and he noticed on the floor, under the seat, a can or jar of paint and a brush.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.878" offset="874872">He, of course, at that time did not know the discovery that had been made officer Tigano earlier at that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.176" offset="904025">So that after this questioning period was over, he released the two boys from interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.307" offset="932551">He did however follow the automobile to the home of the defendant Fahy, and when he saw that they were in the house, he then left and went on about his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.560" offset="977586">Sometime after that, it was reported to him that this episode had occurred at this temple in South Norwalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.783" offset="1010500">It's not clear in the record how it was reported but it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.536" offset="1029517">He then put two into together and returned to the Fahy home without any arrest warrant, without a search warrant, and entered the garage of the home, which was situated under the house, opened the door, went in, opened the door of the automobile, removed the paint can and paintbrush from the car, and brought it back to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.601" offset="1125752">Within a few hours thereafter six or eight officers of the Norwalk Police Department returned to the Fahy home with warrants for the arrest of these two boys and took --</text>

            <text syncTime="276.096" offset="1207777">Returned to the home and took the two boys in custody being forced to actually go into the house and wake the boys up in order to take them out and bring them back to the police station, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.673" offset="1254066">This case which resulted in the judgment which is now before the Court came to trial in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Superior Court, without a jury on June 28th 1960, approximately one year before this Court's decision in Mapp against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.432" offset="1325119">During the course of the trial, the state offered in evidence the paint can and paintbrush, which had been removed by Officer Lindwall from the Fahy home around 5:30 or 6 O' clock on the morning of February 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.599" offset="1405785">Defense counsel's attempt to explore with the states witness Lindwall, the circumstance under which he had obtained this material were held after five or six questions by an objection by the state that the Federal Exclusionary Rule did not apply in the State Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.193" offset="1512155">On appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court after both defendants were found guilty of this offence, in addition to raising various questions, two questions actually, one as to the sufficiency of the evidence to convict under the statute, and two as to the sufficiency of the information to charge an offence.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.661" offset="1593971">We also raise the question of whether or not we have not been erroneously precluded from going into this search and seizure during the trial in view of the Court's decision, this Court decision in Mapp against Ohio, which had been decided by the time they appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court had been perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.424" offset="1701073">We had felt upon appeal that the record was not entirely sufficient with the questions we were able to ask in lower court to present fully the search and seizure question before the Supreme Court of Errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.050" offset="1755617">So that in effect we were asking for either a new trial or for a hearing on the question of whether or not this evidence should have been properly admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.126" offset="1791875">The Connecticut Supreme Court took the view that after dismissing our, the two points I previously mentioned concerning the sufficiency of the evidence and the statutory construction, took the position that the record in the case was sufficient for them to be able to make a determination that the search and seizure by Officer Lindwall was unlawful within the meaning of this Court's opinion in Mapp against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.624" offset="1897827">So that Supreme Court of Errors did affirmatively decide that the search was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.704" offset="1926144">They, then however, preceded to find that in view of other evidence in the case, the seized articles, which were admitted in evidence were not sufficiently harmful to warrant reversal, in effect, decided that the normal rules of harmless error applied and that the conviction could be affirmed upon the other evidence in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.555" offset="3389628">My basic point here is that -- basically what it comes down to it, first, there is no such doctrine as harmless error where there has been an unconstitutional trial procedure, where a coerce confession has been admitted, where coerce admissions have been received, where unlawfully seized evidence has been used, that the normal evidentiary rules of trial of harmless error did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.003" offset="3511359">And the reason for that, in our view, should be that if the reasons, which lay behind the application of the exclusionary rule to State Court proceeding is to have any validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.337" offset="3588681">It seems to us that it cannot result in having a little bit of unconstitutional evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.938" offset="3627133">That there is no such thing and there can be no such thing under the rule of Mapp and Ker as a little bit of the violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.252" offset="3672377">It's like having a little bit of leprosy.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.098" offset="3687737">It just -- it doesn't fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.029" offset="3699440">If there is -- it is true that these defendants did do this deed on the day in question, but it seems to us that they were not convicted at a trial that was free from error, an error of constitutional dimension.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.001" offset="3847398">And in our brief we have, I think, cited four of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="957.665" offset="3934020">We say this that our looking at these cases has shown us however that it does seem that these -- this harmless error rule had just been applied without a real discussion of its application in light of Mapp and Ker.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.221" offset="4008208">And I don't believe that there have been any decisions that have discussed in that light.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.008" offset="4063378">We don't think that the Court need to go any further with this case than to decide that there is not such doctrine as harmless error where you are talking about coerced confession and unlawfully seized evidence and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.762" offset="4114369">But even if they were, we don't want to be heard to say by putting all our emphasis on this first point that we agree with the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors that the evidence admitted in this case was harmless.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.431" offset="6461106">But we -- our main position here is that the Court didn't reach that point that the mere fact that unconstitutionally seized evidence was admitted this year at the whole trial, and the question of prejudice, questions of harmless error are not before the Court, are not for the Court's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.952" offset="6539160">This has been the view of the confession cases and others which we've mentioned in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.715" offset="6570193">So that I would simply say that we feel that error was committed, harmful error was committed at the trial, but even if the error was properly could properly be denominated harmless that we're nevertheless entailed to a reversal, and a new trial, so that these accused can be tried in accordance with the due process, which we feel they did not have in the first trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.818" offset="6806653">There is only one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.996" offset="6815326">My brother in his argument said that when the police officer went to the residence on the morning and questioned, he opened the garage door is not accurate, may not have any significance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.919" offset="6863078">It was a wide open garage and he walked in unmolested and he didn't have to open any doorway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.512" offset="6889409">He didn't have to breakdown any partitions or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.930" offset="6907068">The garage physically was part of the house, but beneath it the living quarters were above, and he simply walked in the driveway and there was the car, and he saw in the car, nobody else in the garage, he did see the can of paint and the paintbrush on the floor of the same car, which earlier that same morning approximately 4:30 or the quarter-to-five he had stopped on a public highway in the city of Norwalk, Connecticut, and enquired of these two young men, what they were doing out at that hour without any headlights lighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.997" offset="7047398">It was dark at that hour in the morning and that was his reason for stopping it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.132" offset="7063907">He was on a routine police duty in the radio car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.606" offset="7077804">And they said, “Well, we just went off for some coffee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.392" offset="7092955">” And while he was talking to them at that time and when he looked in for the automobile, he saw the jar of paint and the brush, but he did nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.877" offset="7126915">He took the registration of the vehicle and allowed these young men to go on their way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.181" offset="7148126">Now later on that morning when he was checking out after his night's tour of duty, it was little after 7 o' clock, there was a notice on the bulletin board of the police headquarters which had comment from -- they complaint it for the effect that someone has painted swastikas on a Jewish Synagogue at a certain location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.250" offset="7232345">Then this officer, I suppose anxious and diligent to be an efficient officer, thought that well that might have been done by these two fellows in the car that I stopped earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.852" offset="7278738">It is true he did not obtain a search warrant; it is true he did not obtain an arrest warrant at that time, but on his own, he went down to this residence, he drove into the driveway, there is the garage wide open, there is the automobile in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.425" offset="8293021">We have to in view of the Mapp decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.945" offset="8303156">However, Mr. Justice Warren this case was decided in June of 1961, no June 1960, your Mapp decision I think was in June of '61, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.864" offset="8358849">This case was tried one year prior to the Mapp decision and at that time, the real arguments in this case and the one that the state principally went up to our state Supreme Court on was they challenged the interpretation of the statute involving damage to a public building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.029" offset="8435440">You will see where they filed demurrers here, challenging the legal sufficiency of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.734" offset="8458324">We proceed with the exception of catalog cases in Connecticut on information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.621" offset="8477863">And they challenge the sufficiency of the information and that it claimed, in the first place they, they claimed that Jewish synagogue may not come under the category of a public building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.906" offset="8519032">And then they argued that assuming that that is true that to take a paintbrush and paint some symbols of any kind, in this case swastikas, which have a significance when they are attached to a Jewish synagogue was not a damage to a public building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.369" offset="8592802">At the most it was just the paint job and you could come along with some material and you could scrub it all, but that was the basis for the claim, the errors primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.711" offset="8646196">Although it is true that during the course of the trial the defense counsel did try to ask of the arresting officer whether or not he did have a search warrant at the time, because Connecticut did not have the exclusionary rule and the objection was made, and it was sustained on the grounds that it was immaterial in a State Court by arrest of state officers the manner in which evidence was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.498" offset="8753403">So long it was exclusively within the State Court and this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.999" offset="8767404">And for that reason they allow that evidence in the case and this, both of these men were found guilty by a judge without the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.488" offset="8809305">Now from that time on, across pending the appeal in the State Supreme Court of Connecticut the Mapp decision came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.792" offset="8846503">Then immediately, the reasons for the basis for the errors in this case were predicated upon Mapp, entirely upon Mapp, and of course, with Mapp on their side, it is a difficult problem for the State of Connecticut to argue that this case, that this evidence was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.396" offset="8924975">I do not so argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.408" offset="8929050">I admit that that evidence should not have been admitted in view of the Mapp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.188" offset="8948172">However, I do respectfully submit to the Court and it's in my brief and I can be substantiated by the record here that there was sufficient other evidence besides the paintbrush and the can to warrant a conviction of guilt in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.399" offset="9024972">In the first place, it was the hour of the morning; in the second place, this automobile was stopped originally within one block of this synagogue; and thirdly, the spontaneous admission by Mr. Fahy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.727" offset="9090278">Now, I use that word spontaneously advisably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.405" offset="9105011">It just isn't a word I picked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.983" offset="9115355">As soon as the officer showed them this search warrant, the arrest warrant, he admitted right of the bat like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.557" offset="9145553">He wasn't questioned into doing anything, he just simply, it was a spontaneous reaction what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.511" offset="9169377">And he said, he did it because he thought it was a prank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.125" offset="9187871">He was bored and he felt that if he did something that had a little excitement in it, well he'd feel better, and he went off and he did this type of act, which of course not only violates the law but it's an (Inaudible) act anyway to deface a religious institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.026" offset="9267493">In view of the great principles of freedom of religion in this country, of course, the state had no alternative but to present them under these fcts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.335" offset="9456724">Now the explanation as to why they took the witness stand and admitted it is argued, well that was because their coerced confessions were admitted prior to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.006" offset="9499355">That is not the reason I respectively argue, because they were claiming that no corpus delicti had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.756" offset="9538435">And our supreme Court in analyzing the evidence show that as I just argued the location, the time, and what was found there, that all of those would have established that a crime had been committed, whether or not these or this particular individual committed it or not was a matter for some additional proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.161" offset="9608025">Therefore the corpus delicti had been established and therefore whatever admission or confession was made was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.689" offset="9638118">And I don't like the connotation of any coerced confessions being interjected into this case, because on the record that is not true, this was all done voluntarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.900" offset="10274983">So in an entire interim of five months approximately Fahy then got on the witness stand and said yes I did it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.973" offset="11283310">When this matter was in the process of coming up to this Court, I was not a member of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.507" offset="11373380">So there was no one to sign papers as far as I face it, until I was admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.050" offset="11515591">So I can answer myself and for the Connecticut Supreme Court, because I was the one that had brought up, I am happy that it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.759" offset="11546415">And when you read it, you can probably see what I am referring to when I don't like to make a statement in the public here about some reference that is made in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.876" offset="11586853">So I'll leave it at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.669" offset="11594062">Now therefore, if it please the Court, based upon this record and the reasons that they gave, you'll see in the finding at paragraph 15, which is on page 12 of the record, that both defendants admitted that they were the ones who painted the swastikas on the synagogue, and they admitted that the paint and the paintbrush found in the car had been used by them for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.773" offset="11686431">You see the basic claim of this whole thing is contained in paragraph 4 of the claimed error on page 13, the information fails to charge an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.209" offset="11728227">They were still arguing that to paint some symbol of any kind on a public building does not come within the purview of our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.890" offset="11774934">They try to claim it was only a misdemeanor and it could be eradicated by some hot water or something else by being rushed on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.875" offset="11802833">But the Supreme Court disregarded that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.926" offset="11811088">Now that was the prime reason of claimant that there was no basis for conviction, and furthermore that the evidence was incredible upon which to indicate the verdict that was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.779" offset="11862497">Then as, Mr. Justice Goldberg has pointed out, our supreme court has stated and I quote it in my brief that the defendants were not claimed nor the transcript show could they claim that the illegal search and seizure induced their admissions and confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.720" offset="11946297">So I respectfully submit on behalf of the State of Connecticut the the issues before this honorable Court is whether or not there was any constitutional violation of this accused right at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.687" offset="12002095">It is true since Mapp and, of course, we have changed our procedures out there since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.333" offset="12028740">We honor the Mapp decision and we do not now offer evidence of this kind in any further criminal position cases, and I am in the Court practically everyday out there trying these matters, and that is, I tell this Court that it is now gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.398" offset="12084955">However at the time we didn't have and we just didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.665" offset="12098017">Now if I am allowed by the Court, I would like to cite a most recent decision that I fortunately was advised off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.735" offset="12134275">It's dated September the 12th of 1963, it's the case of the People versus Parham, P-A-R-H-A-M, and it's out of the state of California, the supreme Court of California, it's in 33, California report 497.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.677" offset="12234062">I cite it to substantiate the position that I advanced on behalf of the state that the paint and the brush were evidence cumulative in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.294" offset="12296547">And this decision, while it is in on this exact factual background, is a very, I thought, excellent analysis of what constitutes cumulative evidence by a Justice Traynor of the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.195" offset="12360182">And it isn't too long a decision and I cite it as the most recent work that I could find on this point as far as collaborating the state's position that this paintbrush and the paint itself were cumulative in nature and not controlling as to the violation of any constitutional right in dispute and I respectfully ask on behalf of the people of State of Connecticut that this conviction be conferred.</text>
