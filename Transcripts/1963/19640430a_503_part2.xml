            <text syncTime="44.906" offset="283042">Second, I would like, in an effort to pull together what I've been saying thus far, to stand off a little and examine from a distance this problem of what should the antitrust rule be, what is the application of the statute where two firms are thinking of entering a market in which neither of them has previously been engaged and then they combine for the purpose of entering it, and I'm thinking of two firms who could clearly go it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.156" offset="452002">Now, one possibility is to say, well, neither of them was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.219" offset="468198">Any entry is no competition and we'll let them do as they please.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.528" offset="501530">This seems to me to turnover to businessmen the opportunity to determine for themselves how far the normal economic laws governing a free enterprise economy will be permitted to operate in new geographic or new technological markets and, I suggest that it would come very close to meaning that, while we might keep what competition we have with respect to old products, in old geographical areas, we really would have very little opportunity of preserving a free market in -- where new technologies develop.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.273" offset="780413">There was, apparently -- as I read the record, there was, apparently, some kind of a stipulation that neither side would put in testimony on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.875" offset="894830">I said one was to let -- require either to buy out the other or to let them sell off the property to a third or, conceivably, in some other fashion, dispose of the shares of Pennsalt.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.714" offset="998275">But, it seems to me, there are plenty of ways to free at least one of these companies to come into the market later if it wishes, which is the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.233" offset="1048325">Now, I was attempting, as I say, to stand off and to suggest what are the possibilities here but one is to leave the whole matter to private agreement wherever you have a new geographical or technological area.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.349" offset="1116766">The second, which seem to me to be -- to attempt to estimate these probabilities in every individual case and to apply some general adjective deprivable enough and then tell district courts to make a finding on that because no finding was made on it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.539" offset="1193566">The third, which I was trying to suggest, was that whenever the conditions that I stated exist, as they plainly do in this case, although I haven't devoted myself much to the fact, then the prospect that more active competition will be foreclosed by the combination are truly very real.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.638" offset="1293876">I don't suggest that anybody can measure the probabilities accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.345" offset="1312789">But, in most cases, given an attractive market, given few suppliers, and I wouldn't call this a competitive market, it's just two companies, given few suppliers, that two other companies engaged in substantially that kind of business, interested and well equipped to enter then, you have a significant chance, perhaps not a probability, the district judge found not a probability here, but a significant chance they'll both go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.069" offset="1427623">After all, there were two new entrants in this market, one, the combination and, the other, Pittsburgh Plate Glass.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.789" offset="1638484">The market has continued to expand and Penn-Olin, I feel very sure in saying, has some-tens of thousands of tons, but I don't really know.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.115" offset="1699819">While you have -- may have a significant chance that both will go in, that certainly shouldn't be disregarded, you have a much greater chance, I would think, that it was merely always a probability that one would go in and having a very few companies in the market, the potential competition is all the more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.311" offset="1796577">Now, of course, the argument that you have in these probabilities rests upon the basic theory of a competitive economy that potential suppliers will come forward to meet the demand when the price, other market conditions offer an opportunity for profit, provided only that combinations and restraints of trade are eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.900" offset="1902947">The combination of two companies in a condition such as this interferes with the operation of those normal market forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.959" offset="1943176">The theory of Section 7 is that the forces will work out.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.076" offset="1971702">Here, given the postulated conditions, there is a very great likelihood that they will work out and it follows, we submit, that any combination involving an inter-corporate stock acquisition should, therefore, be found under those conditions to -- to be one which may substantially lessen competition within the meaning of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.718" offset="2078281">The other point that is raised by way of defense, one that the District Court didn't consider, is the argument that, since Penn-Olin was a brand new company and since Section 7 applies to acquisitions of stock of companies engaged in commerce, Penn-Olin was brand new and wasn't engaged in commerce at the time of the acquisition and, therefore, there is no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.784" offset="2198549">We've dealt with that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.868" offset="2210879">We submit that "engaged in commerce" is simply an adjective intended to describe those corporations that are subject to federal, as opposed to state jurisdiction and that any effort to make this depend on the twinkling of an eye with relation to the exact moment of the acquisition of the stock and the exact moment when you make your first shipment in any interstate commerce would defeat the purpose of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.357" offset="2424769">I shall deal sincerely, and what might seem to be somewhat illogically at first, with the facts and how they relate to whether or not there has been a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.539" offset="2489553">In other words, assuming, for purposes of my discussion, the applicability of Section 7 to this type of transaction because that discussion -- the facts and that question are so intimately related, they don't lend themselves to any division and, with the Court's indulgence, Mr. Connelly will then take up the point last mentioned by the Solicitor General, whether Section 7, in any event, has any application to a transaction such as this and, if not, whether Section 1 of the Sherman Act has been violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.292" offset="2652557">Prior to the argument which I've just heard, I thought we were all pretty much in agreement, both, the Government, the appellees in the court below about the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.797" offset="2722565">The Government stated the issue in its jurisdictional statement at page 16, saying, "The District Court properly recognized that the lessening of competition standard," that is, the lessening competition standard under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, "Lessening of competition standard requires a comparison between the competitive situation brought about by the chairman of transaction and the situation which, with reasonable probability, would have existed had the transaction not occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.021" offset="2875434">This appears again in the Government's brief now at page 28 and, in effect, the Government, the court below, and indeed, all of us have thought up to now, that what was involved in order to decide this case was a comparison between the competitive situation which existed in the southeastern sodium chlorate market prior to Penn-Olin and the situation which existed or came into being after Penn-Olin.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.871" offset="3006882">So that, if Penn-Olin brought about a more competitive situation, enhanced competition to a greater degree than would've been the case if the joint venture had not been formed, then there's no violation of Section 7 because competition has not been lessened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.613" offset="5069824">The Court, therefore, found that the advent of Penn-Olin and, later, PPG will in all likelihood increase the competition which theretofore existed and will bring to buyers of sodium chlorate and to the public the benefits which normally result there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.574" offset="5149654">Now, the Government, I take it, doesn't really contest that there was enhancement of competition, but they really are saying it would've been even better to keep these possibilities or probabilities that have been talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.350" offset="5216737">Mr. Cox indicates there were four possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.311" offset="5236590">One, the possibility that but-for Penn-Olin, both Pennsalt and Olin would've entered the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.079" offset="5263653">Two, that one would've entered and one would have stayed in the wings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.139" offset="5287894">Three; that they would have gone into a joint venture and four that neither would have entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.769" offset="5310464">He overlooks one but which there was discussion by the trial judge, the possibility that one would have entered and, after that one had entered, the other would have lost interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.141" offset="5367933">This is really a fifth possibility which was dealt with by the court below, and the court below pointed out with reference to that possibility that at least Pennsalt, prior to the time that Penn-Olin was formed, Pennsalt had formulated the judgment that the market could stand only one additional competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.695" offset="5462183">So that, if you assume that Olin might, otherwise, have gone in, this, under that view, would've meant that Pennsalt would have been -- been eliminated, no longer in the wings, if you will, I think what its purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.721" offset="6030294">It makes it more an ephemeral possibility, if you will, to use the words I think was the Brown Shoe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.553" offset="6065612">If you look at the record and the findings in the court below, you will see that the Pennsalt management had considered this problem beginning back as early as 1951, that they want to this southeastern market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.389" offset="6120887">They'd studied it and restudied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.986" offset="6131336">They'd contemplated plants of various sizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.435" offset="6141158">They'd had various projections made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.098" offset="6151816">Each time that they actually came to grips with making a decision, they decided against going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.786" offset="6182536">The record at page 692 appears the exhibit which, I think, most accurately reflects what was going on within Pennsalt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.019" offset="6219421">This was in 1957, some-six years after they started to think about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.524" offset="6241468">Mr. Drake, the President of Pennsalt asked the management crew, "Do we agree that it is unlikely in view of the capital requirements and relatively low return on investments that we alone would approve construction of an eastern chlorate plant?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.890" offset="6302908">Second, "Would Olin Mathieson be a logical partner?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.620" offset="6317850">The answer to both questions was yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.837" offset="6330702">So that, almost in the words of the statute there, the Pennsalt management faced the question of whether it would enter this market and decided it was unlikely that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.748" offset="6382320">Never thereafter was Pennsalt satisfied from a business standpoint with the prospects of an adequate return on a plant in the neighborhood of 15,000 tons which it was considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.400" offset="6432998">Olin turned to its consideration at the management level only in 1958, really after Pennsalt had crossed the bridge or -- now, I don't say that the possibility was fully eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.571" offset="6481690">I want to make that clear now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.751" offset="6486392">We don't say that the lower court found that it wasn't completely eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.714" offset="6510216">He said we had not found the return attractive but he couldn't find it was -- we completely eliminated the chance of going in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.340" offset="6540727">In any event, Olin had considered the matter first in 1958 and then quite casually, except for in the -- for laboratory studies, for research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.509" offset="6577403">And then in 1959, the Chemical Division of Olin had recommended its entry into the southeastern sodium chlorate market with a 15,000-ton plant and the management had, at that time, rejected as not being sufficiently attractive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.321" offset="6640619">Again, we do not contend that Olin had finally and forever crossed out the possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.770" offset="6666428">So, we concede there was always a possibility that these companies, which were able, could have entered the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.772" offset="6698506">But, this does not, it seemed to -- seems to us, answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.954" offset="6715225">The question is would they have entered the market, and this is what the lower court struggled with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.194" offset="6740198">It found first that they would not simultaneously have entered the market and this, Your Honors will see on, well reason, indeed, that point was not seriously contested by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.299" offset="7340596">In other words, there was no reasonable probability developed before Judge Steele and, the Government, before this Court, in its jurisdictional statement seemed to accept and endorse that very language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.523" offset="7401514">The net result then, it seems to us, is that Penn-Olin took two companies, neither of which was at all committed to going into this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.501" offset="7457416">Indeed, the fact they had studied it for some time and rejected it suggests they never would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.115" offset="7479881">And, it combined Pennsalt's manufacturing experience, which sold and derived in the west coast, and the fact that Olin was well equipped to make sales in this market, it put those two together in order to bring to this market a third competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.707" offset="7554173">This was the benefit which Judge Steele found flowed from this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.593" offset="7581759">The Government has talked at considerable length about the best postulate or that best possible postulate which appears in Judge Steele's opinion at page 1576 and this is the postulate that, at best, one company might have gone in while the other continued to ponder, which is the language of Judge Steele's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.132" offset="7687920">And Judge Steele, I think, reading his opinion fairly, finds that, on this record, the Government offered no evidence and the court had no basis by which he could compare the level of competition which would have pertained under that best postulate, not a finding but a postulate, but there's no basis for the comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.404" offset="7793037">The very comparison which, initially, the Government conceded should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.124" offset="7815920">How do you compare the before and after?</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.483" offset="7833266">The "but-for Penn-Olin" situation, this is what Judge Steele found lacking in this record and he said at page 1576 of his opinion, "The Government argues that any such comparison to-- with the comparison between competition before Penn-Olin and -- I'm sorry, the competition but for Penn-Olin and the competition with them, any such comparison -- the Government argues that any such comparison is irrelevant in a determination that Olin or Pennsalt would have built its own plant but for Penn-Olin automatically condemns the joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.829" offset="7982686">"Such an interpretation would cut the heart out of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.920" offset="8003062">And, Your Honors will see in the footnote at page -- to that portion of the transcript, his opinion at page 1576, Judge Steele copied in there the transcript of the argument where the Government, in effect, told Judge Steele that such a comparison should not and would not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.585" offset="8097729">Therefore, the fact is that the Government didn't offer any evidence to permit a comparison of the benefits to competition which flowed from the formation of Penn-Olin versus what the condition of competition would've been but-for Penn-Olin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.753" offset="8182366">And, that is essentially what brings the Government to the position which has been urged before Your Honors which is that, automatically, without any careful determination, such as was made here, without any careful consideration of the evidence, if four conditions prevail, any transaction such as this should be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.691" offset="8286124">Indeed, it's really three conditions, as I understand Mr. Cox's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.216" offset="8300231">First, he says if there's an expanding market, and I've indicated the judge said this was no longer a deficit area in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.911" offset="8338996">Second, each company was in that line of business, and just what he means by that condition, I'm not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.612" offset="8377866">Olin had never made this product commercially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.658" offset="8398033">Pennsalt was not an effective competitor in this market, as the lower court found.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.914" offset="8451009">That each was fully equipped, and we do not quarrel with the fact that these companies had the ability financially and resource-wise to go into the business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.700" offset="9202186">There are, it seems to me, under the Government's argument, a number of shadings of the meaning of the word "potential competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.150" offset="9251924">" This Court has recently considered potential competition in the El Paso case, although whether that is properly regarded as potential competition or actual competition might be a subject of considerable discussion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.686" offset="9442095">We are confronted purely and simply with capability plus some interest, but not active participation in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.096" offset="9483786">Now, I think it's important to note when the Government dwells on the benefit to competition of having someone in the wings, rather than on stage, as Penn-Olin is, it's important to note that, in the 10-year-period prior to the formation of this joint venture, there were in the wings Pennsalt and during some of the time, Olin, and Allied Chemical which was selling -- was a sales agent for American Potash and was also one of those rumored to be contemplating entry as the Government proved in the court below or offered evidence in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.220" offset="9660270">Also, Wyandotte Chemical, another substantial chemical company rumored to be considering entry, as well as Virginia Chemical &amp; Smelting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.919" offset="9771029">There were two companies that had the whole market, that dominated it, they were entrenched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.230" offset="9792240">So, what -- where is the value of the evidence in this case of a company in the wings?</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.957" offset="9835186">No value can be discerned from this evidence, so far as those companies were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.926" offset="9863084">They didn't contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.958" offset="9867160">They didn't liven up the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.186" offset="9880116">They didn't have any effect on the market and yet, the court -- the Government would ask this Court to strike down this transaction which brings new competition into this static market, strike this down for this possibility which is, really, it seems to me, all the Government urges, the possibility which it could derive from the fact questionable here of an expanding market from the interest and the capability of these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.950" offset="10027133">It says that, "Given that situation, you should look no further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.447" offset="10141132">This can become to grip -- we can come to grips with it as and when it does but, as of now, there has been no showing on this record, after very careful consideration by the court below, that competition has been lessened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.728" offset="10202258">It's -- to use an analogy that I think was used during the argument in the El Paso case, the horse race analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.918" offset="10239039">This situation is one where neither Pennsalt nor Olin were entered in the race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.693" offset="10274147">Indeed, they were at a different track and the fact that they were at a different track didn't add any competition to the race between Hooker and Am-Pot in the southeastern track.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.015" offset="10339453">The -- I suppose the simpler way to phrase it is simply that the Penn-Olin burden have this word "competitively" the two in the bush.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.188" offset="10392116">The court below concluded, after careful review of the evidence, that Penn-Olin was the means by which the strength of two companies was joined, not for the purpose of further preempting a market which they already occupied, but to break into a market to challenge the supremacy of two companies which were dominating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.376" offset="10480828">Congress, in amending Section 7 of the Clayton Act, recognized that all combinations were not anticompetitive and that, in some -- some instances, combinations may have the effect of stimulating competition, citing of the Brown Shoe case and one might think of many others that follow this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.125" offset="10563897">He concluded the probabilities are that Penn-Olin will have that effect to what the effect of stimulating competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.334" offset="10596707">He made the determination required of him under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.463" offset="10617187">Under that determination, there was, in fact, no lessening of competition in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert R. Connelly</label>
            <text syncTime="2842.651" offset="11474004">Your Honors, I shall address myself to these two points very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.101" offset="11499813">I'd like to start with the observation that Section 7 of the Clayton Act does not purport to cover all acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.095" offset="11539728">It does not cover, for example, any non-corporate acquisitions and in the case of corporate acquisitions, its application is limited to situations where the acquired corporation is engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.310" offset="11616632">With reference to Penn-Olin, the parties here are in entire agreement that a new corporation is not engaged in commerce at the moment of its incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.735" offset="11670340">We're also in agreement that, therefore, Section 7, in this respect, is not to be literally construed but that provision must be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.328" offset="11720704">Where we differ is in the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.160" offset="11736064">The Government would say that the test to be applied in the case of a new corporation is the subjective intent of its incorporators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.422" offset="11777024">If the incorporators desire or intend to have it at some point get into interstate commerce, that that is sufficient to bring it within the language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.644" offset="11825925">In my view, that ignores the historical purpose of Section 7 which was aimed specifically at the elimination of existing enterprises in actual or potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.690" offset="11890082">That is to say, dealing with assets which were then engaged in commerce initially, of course, with ref -- by reference to the acquisition of stock control and then by the 1950 Amendment dealing with the acquisition of the assets themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.724" offset="11966255">And, as this Court pointed out in the Brown Shoe case, the dominant theme of the 1950 Amendment of Section 7 was a fear of what was considered to be a rising tide of economic concentration in the American economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.574" offset="12037622">So far as we know, there has not been any decision dealing with the precise point that I am now presenting to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.112" offset="12079835">The only cases which have dealt with the acquisition of stock in a newly formed company are entirely consistent with the view that I have expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.322" offset="12132707">They each involved an element of concentration by the elimination of the independence of assets then engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.177" offset="12176071">As, for example, in the Alcoa case where a new corporation was formed to takeover the existing business of a competitor, Cleveland Metal Products Company, a producer of aluminum sheets and in the old New England Fish Exchange case, by the formation of a series of new companies to takeover the existing wholesale fish business of companies then in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.432" offset="12297070">The text writers have taken the same view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.412" offset="12313057">I would like to call Your Honors' attention if I may, to one which is not cited in our brief but should've been perhaps, that's Kingman Brewster's Text on Antitrust and American Business Abroad, published in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.236" offset="12384319">At pages 206 and 207, Professor Brewster dealt with the subject of joint ventures and I would like to read to Your Honors just a brief quotation, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.665" offset="12429981">"We assume that Section 7 of the Clayton Act will not be applicable to most joint ventures since, prior to the joining, the venture was not engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.233" offset="12480345">However, it should be noted that, in form, financing of a joint venture may involved the purchase by one company of the stock of a paper subsidiary of another which was formed for the purpose of bringing into being an active industrial or extractive enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.464" offset="12549204">If jointness is achieved by partial acquisition of a preexisting enterprise, we assume Clayton Act standards would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.520" offset="12593403">"Although the argument is not fully articulated, there is a suggestion made in the Government's brief that, perhaps, Penn-Olin was formed to takeover Pennsalt's existing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.563" offset="12665605">That, I think, has been dealt with by -- dealt with already in the argument today to indicate that, in fact, Pennsalt did not have any existing business and that the only shipments that it made, apart from the Penn-Olin exploratory venture, the only shipments it made into this territory were by virtue of special customer relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.579" offset="12761736">But, I should like to call Your Honors' attention to the fact that, if it were true that Penn-Olin had been formed to takeover an existing business of Pennsalt, then that would bring into play the third paragraph of Section 7, under which, the test of the legality is not the probability but the actuality of lessening competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.862" offset="12862777">Your Honors have that paragraph in mind, the one which deals with nothing shall prevent a corporation engaged in commerce from causing the formation of subsidiary corporations, etcetera, where the effect of such formation is not to substantially lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.505" offset="12933413">The fact is that, apart from these exploratory activities with Olin, Penn-Olin was not in the market at all and made no attempt to sell there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.327" offset="12976671">It's a completely new enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.276" offset="12988479">It was not formed to take over any existing facilities or assets that had been devoted to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.908" offset="13022960">There is no element of concentration involved in Penn-Olin, so far as the chlorate industry is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.388" offset="13056920">On the contrary, it added new production and new sales to a market up to then dominated by Hooker and American Potash.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert R. Connelly</label>
            <text syncTime="3308.094" offset="13335698">-- too broadly on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.796" offset="13346565">Turning now to the Sherman Act argument of the Government, first, Your Honors will have in mind that it's a very limited argument that they make in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.817" offset="13394631">They say Sherman Act only if Section 7 is held not applicable because here, the acquired company was not in fact engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.372" offset="13448861">The substance of their argument involves two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.773" offset="13466415">First, a paraphrase of the statement made by this Court in Time-Picayune to the effect that the specific standards of the Clayton Act may be looked at to illuminate the general policy of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.883" offset="13534856">Then, secondly, I should like to put this in appellant's own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.258" offset="13556381">The fact that an acquisition would violate the substantive provisions of Section 7, if the jurisdictional prerequisite had been satisfied, should be given great weight in determining whether it amounts to an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.938" offset="13635166">Now, there are two fallacies in that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.249" offset="13648332">In the first place, the point that's being made here is not a jurisdictional objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.762" offset="13678425">There's no difficulty, jurisdictionally speaking, from having Section 7 apply to corporations -- to the acquisition of assets not theretofore engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.010" offset="13723460">It is just as substantive as the limitation of Section 7 which prevents it from applying to the acquisition of partnership assets by way of illustration, but more importantly, the reliance upon that statement suggests a confusion between those provisions of the Clayton Act which may properly be regarded as specifics relating to types of practices specified, and those provisions of the Clayton Act which relate to the standards of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.492" offset="13869328">So far as the former is concerned, we have no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.351" offset="13880822">We don't quarrel with the proposition that, of course, we can look at the Clayton Act, its provisions with reference to exclusive dealing arrangements, its provisions with reference to the acquisition of stock or assets as a description of practices that may properly be looked at in terms of the application of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.044" offset="13963577">But, when we get to the question of the provisions of the two Acts relating to the test of illegality, the situation is entirely reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.056" offset="14003597">There is nothing specific and, indeed, I can envisage nothing more general than the test of the Clayton Act where the effect may be substantially to lessen competition, a test which was designed specifically to cover situations that had not yet become restraints of trade reachable under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.457" offset="14105161">And therefore, there cannot be a substitution of the probability test of the Clayton Act for the actuality test of restraints of trade under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.218" offset="14156257">So far as I know, in every case in which an acquisition has been held to be violative of the Sherman Act, it involved a situation where the acquiring company was then a major factor in the market and where the acquisition has eliminated a competitor, actual or potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.333" offset="14256671">And, of course those were recently reviewed in the bank cases and the old railroad cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.700" offset="14278196">Here, neither company was a factor in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.941" offset="14299094">The purpose and effect of Penn-Olin was not to eliminate any competition but to provide new competition for the two companies then dominating the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.909" offset="14354996">Now, appellant says that the fact of a joint venture, the fact of Penn-Olin is a joint venture doesn't limit the applicability of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.148" offset="14395956">Well, of course it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.328" offset="14400658">We don't make any contention that it does, but the fact that the venture is joint, by the same token doesn't involve any per se illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.966" offset="14451231">The joint venture took place here only because the parties, having considered separate entry, had decided or had not reached the decision to move forward and had decided that the returns were not sufficiently attractive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.698" offset="14514134">Putting together the two activities, taking the benefit of -- of Pennsalt's production experience in which Olin was deficient, and taking advantage of Olin's sales position in the market and other chemicals being sold to the same paper producers created a situation which did make it sufficiently attractive for the two companies to move forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.821" offset="14634611">The significant part of the term "joint venture" in this context is not the word "joint," but it's the word "venture," the introduction of an entirely new competitive factor and taking away nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.497" offset="14705351">Your Honors will recall that, in the du Pont Cellophane case, the du Pont Cellophane Company was established as a joint venture between the du Pont Company and the French Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.385" offset="14760939">The Government, here, argued with reference to an agreement -- an alleged agreement between the two to divide markets that there was illegality there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.330" offset="14800645">But, so far as the finding of the District Court, neither the Government nor this Court challenged that finding that the joint venture itself was entirely lawful, that the organization of the new company and the continued ownership was lawful, and the Court there said, "It is not the purpose of the Sherman Act or the common law of restraints of trade to discourage establishment of a new business in a new territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.183" offset="14928123">"In any view of its case, therefore, we submit that the judgment below was right and should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3717.800" offset="14974621">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.571" offset="14997608">Counsel, at the beginning of their argument, stated that it had been their understanding that the issue is clearly drawn in the lower court and in this Court up until the oral argument today that, previously, they had understood it to be that what must be compared was the competitive situation as it existed before the combination with the competitive situation as it existed after the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.488" offset="15153298">Now, we agree that that is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.568" offset="15177644">Indeed, I think that I have been addressing myself to that question all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.716" offset="15202200">The problem is to be sure what one means about competitive situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.022" offset="15231457">By "competitive situation," the District Judge and Mr. DeLone apparently mean to look only to the companies who are actually then in the market selling the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.976" offset="15291225">Whereas, by "competitive situation," we mean not only those facts, but also the possibility or degree of probability or likelihood, as the case may be, that other companies who are interested in this field and capable of entering it may now or in the future, become competitors in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.539" offset="15413478">It seems to us that that is very clearly an important part of the administration of both Section 7 and of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.236" offset="15452348">Not that I'm right in what I say with respect to the District Court's view, it appears very clearly on page 1576 of the opinion, just below the middle of the page, Judge Steele says the most favorable assumption that could be made from the Government's standpoint is that either Pennsalt or Olin, but not both, would have entered the market as an independent competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.554" offset="15549628">But, even this hypothesized situation affords no basis for concluding that Penn-Olin had the effect of substantially lessening competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.709" offset="15582229">Whether or not it did, depends upon the competitive impact which Penn-Olin would have had -- will have as against that which might have resulted if Pennsalt or Olin had been an individual market entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.895" offset="15638967">The Government argues that such comparison, that is the effectiveness of one of those in the market as against the other party in the market is irrelevant.</text>

Little Company who were advising Pennsalt and Olin on the advisability of going in.</text>

            <text syncTime="4147.765" offset="16694418">It was suggested that our argument results in an automatic rule that would condemn all combinations to enter in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.747" offset="16730363">I suggest that the Shoe is on the other foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.665" offset="16746036">I heard no qualifications in Mr. DeLone's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.560" offset="16761605">It would indicate when firms couldn't combine to enter a market in which neither had previously been selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.943" offset="16791176">Whereas, I think our standards recognized the need for some selection and that they do require a careful examination of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.265" offset="16836420">True, not as subjective intention of what was going in, in somebody's mind, but a fact you can take hold off, of the capabilities of these companies, of the -- of the activities that they had been engaged in, their size and independent qualification, and of the degree of their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.248" offset="16912384">And it's worth noting that Pennsalt, which had constantly been studying this, one of the last minutes of the corporate directors' meeting recites that if we don't go on the joint venture then Dr. Somebody who was in charge of projecting their new plant will report again on the possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.677" offset="16994095">And Olin, too, had this, the Chemical Division, pressing hard with a new variant proposed of their plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.159" offset="17032025">They were going to put in there with the reports for 1960 which never came forward because the merger had the combination that they had agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.179" offset="17080090">But, we do look at those four facts and we do think this permits a discrimination which would permit companies that can't go in alone to combine and enter a new market but which would prevent those who can go in alone, at least in these circumstances, from combining and thus, covenanting that each of them will stay out, impliedly covenanting, so as not to compete with their subsidiary.</text>
