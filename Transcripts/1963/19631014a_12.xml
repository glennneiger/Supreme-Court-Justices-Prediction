            <text syncTime="11.397" offset="148982">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.274" offset="168417">Petitioners have been convicted of violating Article 27, Section 577 of the Public General Laws of Maryland, the trespass statute which is the same statute that -- that was read to you by Mr. Rauh and was the statute that was involved in the Glen Echo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.490" offset="233305">They were indicted on a two count indictment, which appears on page 6 of the record stating that the petitioner unlawfully did enter upon and cross over the land premises and private property of a certain corporation in the State to with Hooper Food Company, Inc., a corporation, after having been dully notified by Albert Warfel, an agent, not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.296" offset="336541">Second count of the indictment charges that they entered this property which was then and they are posted against trespassers.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.259" offset="364440">They were found guilty on Count One, fine $10 and caused the fine being suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.768" offset="390457">They were acquitted on Count Two.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.362" offset="404773">Petitioners claim that their convictions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the criminal proceedings and judgment enforced racial segregation against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.074" offset="451688">They also claim that the judgments below violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that there was no evidence to sustain the conviction under the indictment and statute which have just been read.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.253" offset="496410">Or if it were to be held that there was sufficient evidence, the indictment statute did not give them fair notice required by the Due Process Clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="150.804" offset="706539">Well, I would let him characterize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.635" offset="717928">But it -- it is an argument upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.597" offset="725765">However, we will not argue it orally because this is the only argument the Solicitor makes and I suppose this is the one that he will be arguing orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.883" offset="762859">The facts of the case are in many respects similar to the facts of the other cases which have just been argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.981" offset="787310">June 17th, 1960, a group of 15 to 18 Negro students among whom where the petitioners who numbered a dozen, entered the lobby of Hooper's restaurant in Baltimore, they were met by the hostess at the door or rather within the restaurant, beyond the door and she stated, "I am sorry but we haven't integrated as yet."</text>
            <text syncTime="195.342" offset="884694">The restaurant manager, Mr. Warfel, whose name appears in the indictment, came up at this point and began to talk to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.217" offset="912280">He testified that he told them it was company policy that we haven't integrated the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.397" offset="936939">And then he said in the process of translating the company policy, the group broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.682" offset="958151">They've brushed by us and sat at various tables in the restaurant and after they were seated, they proceeded to hedge (Inaudible) which is explained as then spreading out and sitting at various other tables in the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.511" offset="1013426">The owner of the corporation operating the restaurant arrived and instructed Warfel to call the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.007" offset="1043414">When the police arrived, the petitioners were seated at various tables, some upstairs, which was a restaurant, and downstairs, which was a cafeteria and grill.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.868" offset="1078836">Warfel read the Maryland Code to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.504" offset="1089390">Clerks and waitresses took down their names and then Mr. Hooper went to the magistrate to obtain warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.753" offset="1114363">There is no question that they were refused service and an effort was made to eject them from the restaurant solely on the basis of their color.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.228" offset="1164309">Hooper made it clear that he agreed with the petitioners' objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.044" offset="1179564">He testified that, "I go on record as I favor what you people are trying to do."</text>
            <text syncTime="274.074" offset="1199626">He also said, "I told Mr. (Inaudible), who was one of the petitioners here, that I felt personally that it was an insult to human dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.407" offset="1228988">I sympathize with it and also told them that my customers govern my policy."</text>
            <text syncTime="287.857" offset="1254797">Petitioners' equal protection argument in this case is presented in three parts and it's essentially the same, the petitioners have made in the -- in the cases preceding this one that is that we submit that the arrest and conviction here served only to enforce the racially discriminatory decision of the owner and then consequently, under Shelley against Kraemer, which was argued at length by Mr. Rauh and other cases holding similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.942" offset="1355107">The State has participated to some significant -- significant extent in enforcing and encouraging racial segregation and that such state action is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.438" offset="1401083">We wholly urge such an argument upon the Court but in view of the fact that it has been argued at length previously, we will prefer to concentrate in this oral argument upon other aspects of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.124" offset="1455835">Petitioners submit -- submit also as in the other cases that the choice of the proprietor was not an authentically private decision but as -- is abundantly demonstrated by the record was influenced by the custom of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.846" offset="1506722">In fact, this -- in this case, it is more clear that in any other because Mr. Hooper said that, "I wholly believe in what you're trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.054" offset="1531591">I completely agree with you and sympathize you but my choice is influenced by the community."</text>
            <text syncTime="363.643" offset="1557922">This choice of the community in turn, we submit, was to some significant extent and that is the terms of burden to a significant degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.949" offset="1591150">And we submit that in this case, the significant has been influenced by historic pattern of Maryland laws which had the purpose of sustaining a segregated society.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.791" offset="1630542">I think it should be recognized that upon these convictions occurred, Maryland had not, in the sense that has been suggested here, turned the corner and started enacting public accommodations, legislations and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.925" offset="1679026">At this time, the Maryland was a State without laws of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.761" offset="1706402">And we say that under such circumstances, the very least, state action should be held to have a role in state custom unless something to the contrary, something contrary to common experience to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.902" offset="1762931">We say that it is beyond belief that a State such as Maryland, which although its policy is now in the process of change, has not helped to create and shape the existing state, what, segregation custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.094" offset="1803786">Well, for many years, it has had a statutory policy of requiring racial segregation in many institutions of public life.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.003" offset="1831372">This is not the charge, the present regime in the State with wrong doing but rather simply to recognize that state responsibility for a custom having once attached, continuous to play a role in what occurs in life.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.816" offset="1886647">And to this extent, we submit, the State continuous or at least at the time of this conviction certainly did continue to be involved to a significant degree in the manifestation of the custom which it had helped to create, shape and perpetuate.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.387" offset="1948923">It maybe that -- that a simple analogy would -- the -- instructive or descriptive it's -- as if one has poisoned the well and then later repented and sought to cleans it.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.190" offset="2008168">Nevertheless, some of the residue of the poison remains and members of the public drink it.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.120" offset="2035858">All we're saying is that the man who poisoned the well is, to some significant degree, involved in the owners that has before and those who drank the water even though he has repented and made efforts to undo what he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.210" offset="2504182">The Criminal Court of the City of Baltimore has held as a matter of Maryland law, in the absence of appropriate legislation forbidding racial discrimination, the operators of privately owned restaurants, even though generally open to the public, may discriminate against persons of another color or race however if you're unjust such a policy maybe deemed to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.655" offset="2585997">And the Maryland Court of Appeals has held in the context of the racial issue in this case that private citizens retained the right to choose their guests or customers and furthermore, that this and maybe enforced by the criminal law of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.274" offset="3364446">It is the position of petitioners that the extent that this ranking is in the form of the application of state power or refusal to act to protect the Negro citizen in this claim of equal service.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.667" offset="3414079">The State has as much responsibility as if it has affirmatively sanctioned the exclusion in terms of -- of positive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.799" offset="3442604">State inaction in various circumstances has been held to deny equal protection of the laws and burden the failure of the State to insist upon a non-discrimination clause and at least would play a role in the decision was held to -- was so characterized.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.870" offset="3498820">Terry against Adams, of course, was a case in which in most views, the State did nothing and thereby, state action in the constitutional sense appeared.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.221" offset="3580217">This Court assumed that the States were living up to their responsibilities in taking the affirmative action necessary to protect the Negro citizens and only in view of this, was the judgment of the Court rendered as it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.197" offset="3632149">The form that the state protection would have to take is not an issue at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.643" offset="3645942">The only thing petitioners submit is that a fortiori, certainly, a criminal conviction cannot be imposed under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.991" offset="3679378">The principle argument made against this type of position is that the logic leads too far that -- that there is no state responsibility here because it would lead to an absurd result in the -- in the case of a club or a church or a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.185" offset="3740087">I notice no one -- everybody gives the case in terms of little boy asking for cigarettes or somebody been thrown out of a home or somebody being thrown out of the church was the case we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.661" offset="3794004">Indeed, due process of law is not taken away from such a property owner when a state requires to serve Negroes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mr. Attorney General</label>
            <text syncTime="1007.756" offset="4134431">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.891" offset="4154911">The facts in this case are certainly different, we believe, and -- from the other cases presented here particularly on the application of the trespass statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.416" offset="4205066">For here, there was a warning given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.292" offset="4224502">The petitioners have perhaps crossed over the manner giving the warning but it's perfectly clear from the testimony of the leader of the group (Inaudible) in the record that they were not permitted to seek themselves in the restaurant due to the statement of the hostess that they had not integrated yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.355" offset="4332753">And the trial court took this into consideration, if you will note the opinion of Judge Burns in the court below where he noted that they were refused seats in this restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.817" offset="4398686">The physical layout of the restaurant is perhaps important to the Court's decision here in that there was a lobby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.346" offset="4440795">The petitioners entered the restaurant through a revolving door and came into a room known or referred to in the record as the lobby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.166" offset="4488025">At the end of the lobby, arms of the door there are four steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.662" offset="4502026">At the top of these steps, the hostess was stationed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.244" offset="4516342">And it is the common practice in this restaurant for the hostess to see all customers coming into the dinning area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.080" offset="4543718">There is a fence separating the dining room and the lobby in this restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.316" offset="4564616">Now, the Maryland trespass statute not only prohibits entry but it prohibits crossing over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.718" offset="4586245">These petitioners crossed over a portion of the premises -- of the restaurant premises after being warned not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.982" offset="4619264">Not only did they enter the dining area and go downstairs after warning, they crossed over a portion of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.736" offset="4646327">And this is precisely what the Maryland statute prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.325" offset="4668688">The -- there's another element in this case which is of significance, we believe, and that is that the police refused to arrest the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.509" offset="4709439">The polices were called by the owner some time after the petitioners had entered the restaurant and after the owner and the manager of the restaurant had, at length, conversed with the leader of the group to try to persuade them to leave peaceably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.738" offset="4806301">He explained his policy to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.483" offset="4817272">He stated that he was segregating, refusing service simply because his customers did not want to eat with Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.869" offset="4858859">That is the only reason he gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.605" offset="4869831">The police were called by the owner after he could not persuade these persons to leave and when the police arrived, they refused to even read the trespass statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.231" offset="4944332">This was done by the restaurant manager himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.342" offset="4956766">The police took no part whatsoever in the goings on in the restaurant itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.479" offset="4977246">The owner had to go all the way down to the police station to swear out warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.449" offset="5001174">He went down to police station and the -- the magistrate apparently called or was called, it's not clear from the record which by the petitioners and they made arrangements to voluntarily come down to the court the following Monday on their own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.120" offset="5071809">There was no custody taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.177" offset="5080064">There was no arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.110" offset="5087796">The State in this situation is certainly a neutral party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.844" offset="5110784">Now, we feel that under the facts and circumstances of this case that this Court is faced with a square decision on whether state criminal trespass conviction of Negroes protesting racial segregation policy in a private restaurant, in a private building constitutes state action proscribed by the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment where neither local laws nor custom requires segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.725" offset="5230320">Now, the mere recitation of -- did statutes does not, in our view, constitute any state custom on the part of the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.496" offset="5281311">As far back as 1960, Chief Judge Thompson of the United States District Court in the District of Maryland in a case in which custom was a factual matter before the court decided in Slack versus Atlantic White Tower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.277" offset="5356440">That as far back as 1957, there was no custom of segregation in -- in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.288" offset="5392488">Furthermore, there is no evidence before the Court in support of the petitioners' contention that there was such a custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.532" offset="5429478">On the other hand, the petitioners' leader admitted that on a previous occasion or on several previous occasions, in the same general area, in the same community, they had sat and had been served in restaurants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.048" offset="5495515">This is certainly very damaging admission on the part of the chief witness for the defendant, the petitioner says in this case if they had been served in other restaurants in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.917" offset="5563016">Certainly, this negates any community custom of segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.993" offset="5579316">There's no other evidence to the contrary either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.933" offset="5595094">The owner in this case would not be penalized in anyway because he admitted Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.972" offset="5631248">There would be no state action that could be taken to forcing to admit Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.734" offset="5654340">He had no contract with any other restaurant owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.117" offset="5667819">He -- the -- there was no state law, there was no state policy, there was no state action on any -- in any respect that could compel the restaurant owner here to segregate his facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.007" offset="5739395">On the question of licensing, in Maryland, there's no difference between the licensing of a club in which persons are excluded and a restaurant except where the facility, no matter what it maybe, is operated without profit to the operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.818" offset="5842631">And this is the only distinction made in the licensing statute which is Section 8 (a) of Article 56 of the Maryland Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.672" offset="5882023">The health statute which involves the regulation by the State on the grounds of sanitation etcetera, applies to all facilities whether they'd be country clubs, private eating clubs, whatever they may be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.169" offset="6072090">Now, the Maryland statute certainly isn't directed at sit-in demonstrations or segregated facilities or neither this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.287" offset="6112528">And as a matter of fact, there was a prior case in Maryland Court of Appeals in which the statute was tried to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.585" offset="6145755">It was -- it was overruled by the Court but in Krause versus Maryland, the Court stated that the statute at the least would've been applicable if notice had been given in a case where there's a repossession of an automobile in a man's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.300" offset="6212524">The only question involved there was that whether there was a notice given and the Court there found there was no such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.239" offset="6240319">The owner wasn't there at the time and that the people went on the property and the only forewarning they had was that he had leaned on the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.957" offset="6283160">The -- all trespassers, regardless of their race, color, sex, color of hair or what -- whatever manner that they -- or whatever characteristics they have that the owner of private property in Maryland that wishes to call into play to forbid their entry are equally guilty under the Maryland trespass statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.969" offset="6415235">If a woman wants to go into a stag bar and the owner doesn't wish to let her enter, I don't think that she could call upon the Fourteenth Amendment in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.160" offset="6460061">The Fourteenth Amendment says nothing about race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.794" offset="6474585">It merely says a State shall not deny equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.726" offset="6486288">In fact this Court, in Brown versus Board of Education said that after an exhaustive study of the debates in Congress and other materials available at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, the time the civil rights bills were enacted that this Court could not determine with any certainty what the Fourteenth Amendment was aiming at.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.249" offset="6944371">The Fifteenth Amendment, again in your theory in Smith versus Allwright, does state that the -- the right to vote shall not be denied on the grounds of race or color and that's clearly such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.052" offset="7003617">The Fourteenth Amendment includes a -- a whole bundle of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.195" offset="7020126">This Court has used it to enforce the rights of the First Amendment -- Fifth Amendment and other Amendments of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.960" offset="7055235">It's not simply a protection due to the expression that's been used in some of the cases, the badge of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.573" offset="7109674">The Amendment just hasn't been determined to be that in all the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.056" offset="7135587">Now, it can hardly be said here than that the State compelled or coerced or mandated or commanded the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.437" offset="7189086">If the court to -- the State here had no connection whatsoever with the decision of this owner to segregate his particular restaurant nor were rights that are constitutionally protected denied to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.158" offset="7272051">Now, in the civil rights cases, it was made clear that there must be an abrogation or denial of rights for which the State alone could be held responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.777" offset="7330461">This was a fundamental wrong that was intended to be a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.189" offset="7352090">The distinction that can be applied to Shelley versus Kraemer here, I think, should be looked down in the light of some other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.825" offset="7422621">For instance, where there is a -- a will in which there is a testamentary clause which prohibits the -- a share of the State can go to one of my sons who marries out of the Hebrew faith, such was the case in Gordon versus Gordon which came up to this Court after Massachusetts had stated that such a discriminatory clause in the will which was given effect by the courts of the Massachusetts was perfectly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.169" offset="7572041">This Court denied certiorari in that case and another situation, the Girard Trustees case which came up to this Court from the courts of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.330" offset="7624704">In that case, it was held that there was no prohibited state action when the provisions and the testamentary instrument, there, the will of Girard, set up a trust to be exercised in the first instance when the case came up before this Court by the City of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.878" offset="7714879">Thrown out on those grounds kept -- court in Pennsylvania then appointed individual trustees which continued the discriminatory policy of this Girard College which was set up under the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.301" offset="7772557">When the case again came before this Court on certiorari, the Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.470" offset="7797217">Now, it's hard to -- to look at those cases or it's hard to justify the results in those cases with the result sought by the petitioners here on the grounds of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.346" offset="7860746">Another case is the Black versus Cutter Lab in which there was a discriminatory provision in a collective bargaining agreement which actually was decided in this Court not to be a grounds of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.671" offset="7942040">There are other examples that perhaps could be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.786" offset="7958549">Now, several cases have been mentioned to this Court as -- today, which I think deserve a little comment, and one is Marsh versus Alabama that -- and comparing that with Terry, for instance, to find that some positive action on the part of the stage called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.158" offset="8056038">First, it should be born in mind that these cases involve rights that were reserved by other Amendments of Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.814" offset="8086653">In the Terry case, it was the Fifteenth Amendment which certainly has a -- a definite connection with the racial issue to the words of Amendment itself and perhaps calls for a stronger state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.169" offset="8152064">The other involves the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.014" offset="8163453">And here, we don't have any such thing that here, the -- the parties that came on to the property and -- were refused service didn't have any rights to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.898" offset="8242970">Now, the mere denial of the rights by the failure to give them redress, certainly, shouldn't amount to state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.180" offset="9408136">On the question of vagueness, certainly, this Court's decision in Alford versus United States is far more difficult to understand than what the Maryland Court of Appeals did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.987" offset="9479293">Now, the Maryland Court of Appeals found that there was a crime committed if a statute was violated whereas in -- in Alford and this is the first instance that anyone had come up under this situation, in Alford, there was a statute which prevented the construction or the building of a fire near a forest in the public domain, that's all the statute said and the man was convicted for building a fires -- a fire near the forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.742" offset="9602382">Now, he was the first one to come before this Court or any court in which the -- an appellate court anyway, determined what that statute meant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.808" offset="10186585">If anything this -- the officers of the State here discouraged the owner from bringing the case even in the court, they required him to go down the police station which in a number of cases, I wouldn't even do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.992" offset="10259310">There was no evidence at all that the police said any forewarning of the -- the incident that took place or there was any state encouragement of the -- the segregation policies of the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.097" offset="10351783">They had no ownership rights in the building or the -- or the -- of the restaurant itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.850" offset="10382817">There was no one in this -- in the state employee that was working there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.337" offset="10408730">All the mitigating factors that -- that seem to valid this Court in -- in rendering its decisions in this field are absent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.421" offset="10469021">And it doesn't seem to be an easy way to -- to reach a decision one way or the other on the primary constitutional issue raised.</text>
