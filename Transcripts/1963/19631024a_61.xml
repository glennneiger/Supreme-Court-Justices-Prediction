            <text syncTime="25.852" offset="206764">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.018" offset="239470">Ethel Meyer, the petitioner, is the wife of Peter Meyer, deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.424" offset="273115">Peter Meyer, in 1943, had life insurance policies totaling some $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.035" offset="315538">Under 1943, he borrowed from the Huntington National Bank of Ohio the sum of about $26,000 and made assignments and pledged these life insurance policies upon which his wife was the beneficiary to the bank for these loans which were made to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.154" offset="423999">Now, in 1943, Peter Meyer did not owe the United States Government any moneys, any tax moneys at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.483" offset="465272">In 1945 and 1946 -- 1946, the tax liabilities for those years arose which were due to the Government of the United States from Peter Meyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.216" offset="536221">Now, the Government in 1946 and in 1947 made assessments on those tax moneys some $6100.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.032" offset="599542">And as soon as they made those tax assessments under the Code, United States Code, the tax liens arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.975" offset="655235">Now, they were unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.532" offset="669550">These taxes were unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.659" offset="678013">In 1955, Peter Meyer died, so that there was due to the Government from his estate some $6100.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.141" offset="735901">The bank having received assignments and pledge of these policies upon his death, the bank received the sum of $26,800 or thereabouts, $26,000, I should say, $26,800, which was due the bank for the loans and that exhausted practically with the exception of some $400, the entire shares surrender value of the policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.311" offset="1088658">And the United States Government then brought an action against Ethel Meyer, individually and as executrix of the estate, of Peter Meyer's estate, to collect this $6100.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.764" offset="1150412">And the -- the position that counsel for Mrs. Meyer took was that this money is justly due to -- from her estates because it was due from the estate, the husband and the estate owed the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.654" offset="1221987">However, the courts granted summary judgment against her personally upon the basis that the proceeds that she received were subject to those tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.685" offset="1282069">Now, because there are decisions rendered by the United States Supreme Court in the case of -- which were handed down in 1958, in the case of Commissioner against Stern and United States against Bess, where this Court has held, and I've omitted an important trace of this case, New York State Section 166 has an insurance law which states that the proceeds of life insurance are entirely exempt from creditors of the insured.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.485" offset="1889364">This is the crux of the case and I'm going to come to it right this minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.280" offset="1908485">The Government is relying upon a decision which was handed down in the United States against Behrens in 1956 or some two years before this Court handed down decisions in United States against Bess, in which Judge Learned Hand had before him a situation not similar to ours and briefly, the facts in the Behrens case were as follows, in which the equitable doctrine of marshaling was -- was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.776" offset="2038471">In the Behrens case, we had the tax liens arising and attaching immediately to the cash surrender value, immediately, which is done (Inaudible) as I'll come to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.765" offset="2094477">Thereafter, because the tax liens in the Behrens case weren't filed, they had to be recorded and the bank in that case being an innocent holder, having -- not had an opportunity to check against the recording acts, to see whether there were any tax liens on fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.433" offset="2177128">The bank subsequently, in the Behrens case, lent money to the insured and -- and up to the full amount of the cash surrender value.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.797" offset="2238568">Now, what happened there was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.630" offset="2249853">In as much as the tax lien was not filed in the proper office, the Court in the Behrens case held that the Government did not have a first lien but it had a second lien subject to the bank, but it still had a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.295" offset="2320593">And Judge Learned Hand said in applying the marshaling doctrine, he says, in as much as the bank can collect the proceeds of the policy and also the entire proceeds of the policy, which would include the cash surrender value, "We will allow the bank to attach its lien to the widow's share so that the Government which had the tax lien on the cash surrender value can be paid."</text>
            <text syncTime="586.460" offset="2449220">We don't dispute that, but we say that our case is a material difference, is our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.443" offset="2481194">In 1943, there was no tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.739" offset="2498330">There was not even a tax due.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.041" offset="2507525">In 1943, Mr. Meyer borrowed from the Ohio Bank the full cash surrender value of the policy, so we start with the face there is no more cash surrender value left, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.414" offset="2573040">The Government didn't have a secondary lien, it didn't attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.918" offset="2587042">There was nothing due the Government at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.853" offset="2598745">Now, some three years later, the Government comes along and makes an assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.963" offset="2631241">As soon as that assessment is made, if there is any property or property rights that the insured has in 1946 and 1947, it will attach, but there's nothing left because the cash surrender value was disposed off, so that the marshaling doctrine can't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.553" offset="2717550">The cash surrender value was disposed off in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.091" offset="2735731">Now, the Government's lien attaches to what?</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.597" offset="5745768">The Government's position in this case can be summarized, I think, shortly in three or four propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.970" offset="5791222">The first one is that as a matter of legal precedent and prior authority, this case is on all force with Behrens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.884" offset="5830928">There is no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.217" offset="5840227">In fact that in Behrens, the unrecorded federal tax lien here arose before the bank made its loan is immaterial because the lien as against the bank can become effective until it was recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.585" offset="5917759">And the Behrens' opinion makes it quite clear, explicitly clear that the cases to be treated as one in which there is a prior lien in favor of the bank for a loan made by a bank against the security of an insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.833" offset="6006680">So that the Behrens case is -- is merely in point and is the decided law prior to the case coming here that was relied upon by the court below, it was also relied upon by the Sixth Circuit, the recent case went, which is pending on certiorari -- petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.771" offset="6090480">So the question is whether Behrens was wrong or right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.662" offset="6113991">We think it's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.400" offset="6120991">We think the case is clearly stated by Judge Learned Hand, when he points out that when you come to the point of the death of the insured, you have a bond, in pace amount of the insurance policy, which is subject to claims on creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.088" offset="6199672">One claim that of the United States which is good against the part of the fund, the insurance proceeds, the other claim that of a bank which is good against the whole of the bond, all of the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.432" offset="6253066">The wife claiming as beneficiary, her interest is junior to both, since it was wholly contingent one, arising only after the taxpayer's death and on the condition that she would remain his beneficiary at that time, since he deserved during his lifetime, the full power to change beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.779" offset="6334464">Her interest up until the point of his death was a mere expectancy, vesting only at his death, but vesting subject to these prior liens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.147" offset="12039920">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.890" offset="12046921">Your Honors, this is beyond dispute, a mere reading of Commissioner against Stern which was decided by this Court 1958 involving a Kentucky statute similar to the New York statute of exemption of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.688" offset="12122154">And I'm quoting from page 42 of the Court's opinion just a mere sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.173" offset="12140022">"We hold that the Kentucky statutes govern the question of the beneficiary liability and treat no liability -- and create no liability of respondent," that's the Government, "to the -- to the Government in the circumstances of the case."</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.925" offset="12219120">In that case, in Commission against Stern, the Government -- the widow, upon the death of the insured received not only the proceeds but received also the full cash surrender value of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.411" offset="12273037">And the Government came along and said, "Why, we want that money to the extent of the full cash surrender value."</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.722" offset="12302294">The United States Supreme Court in that case said, "The Government can't get it by reason of this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.391" offset="12328939">It can only get it --" page 47, "We agree that the state law may not destroy a lien which has attached in the insured's lifetime."</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.260" offset="12380453">So that in this case, in our case, if the Government's lien attached in the lifetime of the insured, the Government would get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.767" offset="12410441">But in as much as it didn't, this -- the -- the Government being accredited just like any other creditor must follow state law and these proceeds are entirely exempt on the state law and it hasn't gotten any greater right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.464" offset="12469269">Congress has not yet enacted any lien granting to the Government any right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.240" offset="12496332">As a matter of fact, the only law of Congress is laid down where the Government is given a tax lien on all property and property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.972" offset="12531231">What are property and property rights are still defined by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.097" offset="12547741">And in this case, Section 166 defines what a property and property rights and therefore, the Government's lien never attached during a lifetime and the widow isn't entitled to her own proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.304" offset="12596537">She never got the chance to run the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.437" offset="12605106">In the Behrens' case, the widow got the full cash surrender value and paid the bank the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.027" offset="12635512">In our case, she only got her proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.983" offset="12643349">That's entirely exempted.</text>
