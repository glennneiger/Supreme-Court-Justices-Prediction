            <label>Mr. Floyd A. Fredrickson</label>
            <text syncTime="0.593" offset="105723">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.527" offset="117530">As we took the recess, we were getting into the discussion of the bailor-bailee common law which is primarily contained in the -- in the amicus brief filed by the Government in this case in the discussion of -- of -- of that case at -- and on the theory of the Government that our position is somewhat like bailor.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.607" offset="221811">Of course, we should keep in mind that in this instance, the maritime law that while these cases may have something to do by way of analogy, they're not controlling so far as the relationships between a stevedore and a shipowner are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.805" offset="290565">Now, in looking at the cases I believe that the fairest thing probably that my opponent could expect would -- would be that the Booth case would look at this cases and say that there is some law in the bailor-bailee field that makes the bailor subject to the same warranties that a manufacturer or seller has.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.819" offset="402683">Now, you read the Booth opinion and the Court in the Booth opinion says, I won't quote exactly, but the appellant, the shipowner in the Booth case has cited to us many cases in the bailor-bailee field.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.295" offset="460570">We've read them and we find that they all involve negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.975" offset="479274">Negligence is always a factor in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.215" offset="492231">And the Booth -- the Court in the Booth case looks at the Mowbray case referred to by my opponent this morning, it's an Old English Queen's bench case.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.504" offset="541341">And in that case, a shipowner supplied through a stevedore a piece of gear which failed and a stevedore was subject to liability to one of the longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.281" offset="592541">Then the question was whether the stevedore company could recover indemnity from a steamship company which had supplied this piece of gear.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.889" offset="634964">But the question that the Court faced in the Mowbray case was whether or not a stevedore which itself could have inspected it, this gear and seen the defect could recover from a supplier, the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.849" offset="702777">In other words, the defect in that case was visible and could have been seen and the -- the Court in the Booth case frankly says that that's -- that's the way we read the Mowbray case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.018" offset="751470">The Court in the Booth case also looks at this Hoisting Engine Company case, a case cited promptly by the Government and says that in that case also, the Court was very careful in saying that inspection by the supplier would've determined if there were a defect in this -- in the equipment supplied.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.036" offset="995558">I might say Mr. Justice White that they cite the Cavallo (ph) case very prominently, a case in which a New York roller skating rink supplied one of its patrons with some roller skates and she skated away sometime after she had got the skates, the wheel collapsed and she fell off and was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.578" offset="1073716">And the New York Court does say as part of its opinion, that the rink owed her a warranty of the fitness of those skates but however, they also found negligence on the part of the New York skating rink on the basis of testimony that you could have seen that a locknut on the end of this skate was not holding it so that the -- the statement is -- is just to have a dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.348" offset="1184789">And I'm frank to admit Your Honor that so are the cases that I've cited for the other proposition that a bailor only has an obligation of reasonable inspection because I've cited to Your Honors some horse rental cases in which the Court also found negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.459" offset="1405158">I -- I admit that's a distinction in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.512" offset="1413413">The Court's haven't -- haven't placed it on that basis as in -- it isn't in the facts of the cases that the Government has cited nor in mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.824" offset="1454686">I -- I think the point is that there just is no common law analogy that we can look to that has a determinative answer to -- to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.079" offset="1511737">Even the -- the -- the commentators that are referred to rather generously by the Government say that sadly enough we don't find the -- the authority that would hold as we think it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.950" offset="1579133">In other words that in -- in a non-sales case that a warranty of fitness will be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.982" offset="1603271">Now, (Inaudible) which is not cited in my brief and I don't know that that it's too important but that (Inaudible) 2d.150, the implied warranty of fitness for breach of which the bailor maybe -- maybe held liable is not an absolute warranty so as to make the bailor an insurer against injury to the bailee under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.302" offset="1692609">But as rather a warranty by the bailor that he has exercised reasonable care to ascertain that the chattel is safe and suitable for the purpose for which it's hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.038" offset="1727509">Now, we've met that test in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.902" offset="1739003">As -- as we all agree, that -- that test is behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.536" offset="1753527">Now, I referred this Court to another perhaps analogy in the common law field.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.506" offset="1789367">A supplier who was primarily engaged in furnishing services as distinguished from equipment and I've referred Your Honors to some of the blood transfusion cases, Perlmutter from New York and so on, where the courts -- where a patient in a hospital receives blood that is unfit for his system.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.975" offset="1883303">And -- and -- and the patient says well -- or his administrator usually says that there's a warranty of the fitness of this blood that's supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.643" offset="1933981">It doesn't matter if -- if the hospital took every step necessary to protect its patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.272" offset="1956446">There's a warranty and the courts have refused to apply a warranty in that instance saying that they served -- that the contract when you get in the hospital is primarily one for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.578" offset="1997720">And we make the same contention so far as a stevedore is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.883" offset="2010885">Primarily, what the ship is hiring is longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.340" offset="2024782">It is true that we bring aboard gear incidental to our work and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.421" offset="2041083">But primarily, what the -- what the shipowner is hiring is a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.370" offset="2060831">Its -- its hiring longshoreman that we employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.442" offset="2077132">Now, as I say again, I don't think that the bailor-bailee cases in the common law field advance the ball one way or the other as far as this case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.103" offset="2139826">I -- I think merely in closing, refer to some of the policy questions that have been -- been raised by my opponent and perhaps by the Court, it seems to me that that the question is -- was where -- where do we want to go from here?</text>
            <text syncTime="526.649" offset="2209938">Now, the -- between the longshoremen and the shipowner, we all agree that there is a warranty of seaworthiness, doesn't have anything to do with fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.799" offset="2254555">That is behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.449" offset="2261138">And the -- why -- why is that there?</text>
            <text syncTime="541.989" offset="2271378">Well, as this Court has said for -- for two reasons, the shipowner is better able to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.568" offset="2301680">He's an economic -- or the longshoreman is an economic unequal.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.078" offset="2319653">Also, this Court has analogized the longshoremen to the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.781" offset="2338461">Instead the longshoreman is doing work traditionally done by seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.765" offset="2354448">And there's a whole developmental history of -- of the warranty of seaworthiness as it extends to seamen which isn't applicable to the situation between stevedore company and shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.107" offset="2415783">And there's -- the second reason is that the longshoreman, the individual longshoreman when he goes aboard the ship, he doesn't have -- is in any position to make a contract as to what warranties will be extended to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.502" offset="2473357">As is the situation so far as -- as the shipowner and stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.997" offset="2495404">Now I make this point for the reason that I -- I don't believe there's any compelling reason for this Court to im -- imply an absolute warranty so far as the stevedore is concerned in its relations to a steamship company as there was for the Court to do it in the situation of an individual longshoreman or a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.880" offset="2602924">Shipowners and stevedores are at least, economic equals and -- and perhaps more tends toward the -- the steamship company having a more to say about how the contracts are going to be drawn because my bailees is not really in the record, stevedores compete for business when a ship comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.777" offset="2694457">And the steamship company is the one who can call the shot so to speak as to what -- what kind of contracts you're going to have to perform the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.216" offset="2728208">So that I say that -- that the reasons for the Court giving a warranty of seaworthiness to a longshoreman are not applicable vis-a-vis steamship company and -- and -- and stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.826" offset="2794663">And as a matter of fact, shipowners do make contracts and we have one in this case of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.417" offset="2817024">And there's no -- there's no compelling need to require a stevedore company to be a guarantor of its equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.608" offset="2861850">We make the point that making us responsible for negligence, implying that or -- or making an implied warranty in our agreements that -- that we're responsible for negligence, that if we see that a condition is not as it should be and we go ahead and work or we negligently -- negligently supply something, I think that's enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.876" offset="2966862">You -- you -- you've gone as far as -- as need be in -- in the situation as it is in our industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.177" offset="2992044">Now, I think also that -- that the point of who is better able to control this situation about the equipment is someone begs the question because here we do -- the shipowner can sue us of course and is -- is a given, an inference of negligence as he was in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.835" offset="3090683">And what happened actually was the shipowner failed in its proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.636" offset="3113880">Even -- given the advantages of the inference still the -- the testimony from our side that we had inspected, that we had made a test, overcame that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.218" offset="3152227">I think the nub of the case is that -- is that -- the shipowner has this onerous burden of -- of unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.014" offset="3187440">He -- he -- he wants to pass it on -- he wants to pass it on to somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.036" offset="3207502">But as this Court has said, the shipowners' responsibility vis-a-vis the longshoreman is on different principles than the responsibilities between shipowner and stevedore company and that there is no warranty of seaworthiness between stevedore company and shipowner and no reason to -- to extend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.761" offset="3298408">We simply say that liability with fault is a sufficient test to charge a stevedore company.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.745" offset="3350340">And that's the position we take in this case and we believe it's -- it's justified by what this Court has said previously and by the facts in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.725" offset="3386284">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erskine B. Wood</label>
            <text syncTime="824.296" offset="3400600">I have just a couple of very brief remarks in reply, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.511" offset="3429439">I think Mr. Fredrickson and I are in agreement that these bailment cases, many of them are fuzzy and it's for that very reason that we don't wish to push the law or ask that the law be pushed beyond the confines of a -- of a maritime case and I think this may serve to answer the question that was in Mr. Justice White's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.884" offset="3534869">That here -- because the bailment cases are fuzzy, it really isn't necessary to go beyond the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.444" offset="3573112">We're dealing with maritime law where the shipowner owes this absolute warranty and where the stevedore has exclusive possession and use of this and brings in accord and makes the ship -- renders the ship liable and therefore it seems altogether fitting that there should be the implied warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.510" offset="3649390">To advert just once again to Mr. Justice Black's question concerning the insurance, I -- I want to again emphasize that we are not asking for a change in what has apparently been the law because since the Booth case, it was from -- for a bigger community, that is the Second Circuit, a bigger shipping community than the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.115" offset="3755865">Why the law has been that the shipowner -- I mean that the stevedore owes this warranty and I'm sure that no place even on the West Coast have stevedores cancel their insurance, their liability insurance here, because of the 2-to-1 decision of the Ninth Circuit pending before coming up here on certiorari.</text>
