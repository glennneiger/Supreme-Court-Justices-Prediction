            <text syncTime="47.359" offset="292760">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.350" offset="308746">These case is here on direct appeal by the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.422" offset="353050">The case arises under Section 212 (c) of the Interstate Commerce Act and involves the validity of certain restrictions which the Commission placed in the certificate of a motor carrier upon converting it from contract carrier status to common carrier status.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.895" offset="422954">I think that a brief description of the legal context of which the case arises might be helpful to an understanding of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.428" offset="457122">Prior to 1957, the Motor Carrier Act defined contract carriers as any carriers other than common carriers who engaged in transportation under individual contracts or agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.385" offset="520861">In 1957 however, at the request of the Commission, Congress tightened that definition so as to restrict the term 'contract carrier' to those who engaged in transportation under continuing contracts with one or limited number of shippers and who either allocated vehicles for a continuing period for the exclusive use of each individual customer or who performed the service designed to meet a distinctive need of each individual customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.211" offset="656175">In addition and also at the urging of the Commission, Congress enacted Section 212 (c) a 'grandfather clause' providing for the conversion to common carrier status of those contract carriers whose operations were so extensive or so generalized that they did not fit the new amended definition of contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.022" offset="759411">Section 212 (c) provided that the Commission might revoke the permit of any such contract carrier and issue it instead a common carrier certificate authorizing transportation of the same commodities between the same points or within the same territories as is authorized by the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.499" offset="853347">It's against that legal background that this case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.086" offset="875708">Prior to 1957, J.B. Montgomery Incorporated was operating as a contract carrier under a permit issued to its predecessor in 1943 under the grandfather clause of the Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.153" offset="935999">Montgomery's permit authorized it to serve designated points within abroad mid-western area, and the carry commodities which were described by reference to the particular kinds of businesses which customarily dealt in or used those commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.715" offset="1590209">In addition, in connection with each of these three commodity categories, the permit contained a so-called keystone restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.010" offset="1623437">This was a restriction limiting Montgomery to performing services under contract with persons engaged in the particular kind of business associated with the commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.538" offset="4365563">Our contention would be that the -- whatever -- that the limitations of the certificate are inherent in the keystone restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.355" offset="4404746">Anything that the carrier would be barred from doing under the certificate limitations, it would also be barred from doing under the keystone restrictions, perhaps if there were appropriate modifications that is in the certificate restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.455" offset="4457200">But the converse is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.373" offset="4472874">The certificate restriction does not confine the shipper to serving only those persons whom it was authorized to contract with by the keystone restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.058" offset="4511640">Because for example, they -- the shipper need not -- while it can only carry goods to and from department stores, it need not do that under contract with department stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.343" offset="4544763">It may also do that on behalf of persons whose -- whose make shipments to department stores or who receives shipments from department stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.135" offset="4579871">For example, manufacturers or wholesale jobbers or other kinds of suppliers who sell to department stores or retail specialty shops who purchase from department store wholesalers or various kinds of food procedures who sell to packing houses and they're number of other examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.269" offset="4648417">Now to that extent, our conception of the statute does permit in expansion of the carrier's operating rights, but it's only as much of an expansion as is an unavoidable consequence of its acquisition of common carriers status.</text>

            <text syncTime="1252.090" offset="5111724">The Commission has always been reluctant to place in common carrier certificates, provisions which explicitly limit the classes of customers with who may carry or may deal and it didn't do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.735" offset="5162297">But if the restrictions that did carry over into this certificate, are in effect territorial restrictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.053" offset="5215587">Between retail and wholesale esta -- between outlets of retail and wholesale establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.150" offset="5235963">Now, there's ample authority for the imposition of highly specialized service restrictions of this kind upon common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.010" offset="5275460">One example as I noted before, was the so-called plant site restriction which authorizes carriage between to or from the plant site of a particular business or class of businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.601" offset="5317778">In effect, that's what this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.902" offset="5326973">But another closely analogous and even more widely used type of limitation is the so-called intended use restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.639" offset="5361977">Now, this is a commodity description which limits the carrier to carrying commodities which are identified -- with what -- well, to carrying commodities which have actually been produced or distributed by a particular kind of business or which are intended for -- for future use or distribution by a particular kind of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.144" offset="5439927">Now, an example of that came before this Court few years ago in the Andrew Nelson case in 355 U.S. and that case involved a contract carrier whose permit contained a commodity description referring to department stores stock in trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.793" offset="5506591">The Commission held in this Court and an opinion by Mr. Justice Clark, agreed that that phrase, department store stock in trade limited the carrier to carrying goods which were actually intended for a department -- for drugstore rather, drugstore stock in trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.191" offset="5576182">Not merely goods which are the general type that drugstores usually deal in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.750" offset="5594363">Well that case involved the contract carrier and therefore is not authority in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.898" offset="5614947">The Commission has imposed similar restrictions and literally hundreds of cases since the very earliest days of motor carrier regulation upon common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.452" offset="5653191">And they've never been taught inconsistent with common carrier status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.260" offset="5668446">And in fact, in one instance, they were upheld by a District Court against precisely that contention in a decision later affirmed per curiam by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.191" offset="5704182">I refer to the Morehouse case which is cited at page 32 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.037" offset="5723512">Now with this intended use, commodity descriptions are consistent with common carrier status and not contrary to any statutory injunction, so are the point-to-point or territorial limitations which the Commission imposed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.835" offset="5782758">Even though they do have the indirect effect of limiting somewhat, though not to the same degree as the keystone restrictions, the classes of persons with whom the carrier may deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.567" offset="5833644">Now essentially, turning to the Section 212 (c) issue, essentially, what the Commission has done is simply to make explicit in the common carrier certificate, the territorial limitations, the point-to-point or movement limitations, which are implicit in the keystone restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.362" offset="5916818">Obviously, Section 212 (c) contemplates the parity of some sort between the prior and future operating authorities, and the only question is whether that's a parity of substance or parity of mere form or language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.547" offset="5969586">And in our view, it's a parity of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.711" offset="5982229">The substance of the operating rights contained in the contract carrier permit, are to be found not only in those provisions which explicitly refer to shipping points territories and commodities but also in the keystone restrictions which implicitly impose similar restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.044" offset="6055581">For example, any carrier which is subject to a keystone restriction limiting it to dealing with department stores or operating under contract to department stores will in practical effect be limited to carrying commodities which have been used or sold or which are intended for future sale or use by a department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.928" offset="6151084">So that the keystone restriction limits the carrier to precisely the same extent as would a commodity -- commodity description of the intended use variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.181" offset="6192044">By the same token of the keystone restriction also limits the contract carrier to the same degree as -- as to its movements, as due the restrictions which were imposed by the Commission in the certificate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.132" offset="6251917">Now, if those restrictions had been explicit in the contract carrier permit, there would be no question that they have to be carried over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.508" offset="6285354">The letter of the statute would clearly require that explicit commodity or territorial descriptions in the contract carrier permit be carried over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.840" offset="6326732">And we think they should be no less transferable merely because they're only implicit in the keystone restrictions rather than explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.400" offset="6368946">Now, the consequence of rejecting our view and accepting the -- the appellee's view would be an enormous expansion of the operating rights of this contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.535" offset="6413563">Standing alone, the commodity and -- the commodity descriptions are certainly broad enough to authorize the transportation of almost every con -- consumer commodity so that this carrier will in effect become a general common carrier of general commodities for all commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.726" offset="6494229">It will thereby acquire rights which are greater than those which most common carriers have, and it will have acquired them without ever having made a showing of public convenience and necessity such as this required of common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.846" offset="6550758">There's no evidence we think that Cong -- Congress intended any such expansion or windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.433" offset="6577089">Two considerations I think bear -- bear that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.756" offset="6594435">In the first place, the whole purpose of the 1957 Amendments was to prevent crippling encroachment upon the business of common carriers by contract carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.226" offset="6640306">Under the original statutory definition, many contract carriers had so expanded their operations that some of them had 100 or even more contracts and were really competing very substantially with common carriers and draining off traffic from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.807" offset="6710627">The original intent at least as the Commission had believed it was that these contract carriers were to be relatively free of regulation because they didn't really compete on any broad scale with common carriers or threatened their economic viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.263" offset="6776456">This Court held in 1956 that Commission had no statutory authority to place a ceiling upon the number of contracts into which a contract carrier might enter or to prevent the common contract carrier from searching aggressively for a new business within the limits of its permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.376" offset="6848867">It was for that reason that the Commission went to Congress and secured new legislation which would limit the class of contract carriers and prevent this encroachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.287" offset="6892544">Senator Smathers in prevent -- presenting the bill of -- to the -- the Senate, explicitly pointed out that the unlimited diversion of traffic from common to contract carriers might well endanger the ability of the common carriers to render adequate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.267" offset="6964433">Now, we think it would be completely at odds with that statutory progress to construe this grandfather clause as tolerating and even promoting the very evil which Congress sought to cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.854" offset="7010826">And well it's true that the converted contract carrier is no longer free of regulation as he was before, he now is subject to the same regulation as any other common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.710" offset="7054190">The fact remains that he has never been required to make a showing of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.132" offset="7079894">And for that reason alone, we don't think that Congress could've intended to permit this tremendous augmentation of his operating authority at the expense of existing common carriers who had made such a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.980" offset="7139244">And the second reason why we don't think Congress could possibly have intended this tremendous expansion of operating rights is the fact that this is a grandfather clause repeatedly referred to as such by the people who described it or discussed it in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.302" offset="7200580">The other grandfather clauses of the Motor Carrier Act had been construed by this Court as expressing a congressional purpose to maintain substantial parity between the prior and subsequent operations of the carrier or in this case, operating rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.942" offset="7275186">We see no reason why this grandfather provision should be construed in accordance with any other principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.839" offset="7398693">That is to say the Committee reports described the grandfather clause and precisely the language that was used in the statute, namely, it was said that it authorized the carrier to make this -- to transport the same commodities between the same points and within the same territories as it had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.661" offset="7474030">So we think these shows that Congress simply -- that the language Congress used in Section 212 (c) was just its way of saying, this is a grandfather clause which is to be construed in -- in light of concept of substantial parity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.257" offset="7592417">The basic issue before this Court is whether or not Montgomery as a converted carrier, precede a certificate which authorized the transportation of the same commodities between the same points or within the same territory as contained in its permit of the contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.761" offset="7674441">It is our basic position that the imposition of restrictions limiting shipments to those moving from to or between particular types of businesses is a territorial restriction which detracts or takes away from the authority held by Montgomery as a contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.121" offset="7767855">It is our further basic position that the Commission was wholly without the statutory authority and right to impose such restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.605" offset="7825742">The attorney for the Government indicates that the whole basis for their position is that they were -- the Commission was attempting to establish substantial parity between the authority held by Montgomery as a contract carrier and that to be received by it as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.793" offset="7922500">The Commission and the Government virtually admit both in their brief and in this oral presentation that something has been taken away from Montgomery as converted carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.077" offset="7971715">In their brief, they say that this would be a small price to pay for the mischief of a grant of unlimited authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.926" offset="8011107">We submit that so far as Montgomery is concerned, it is a very great price and something very real and substantial is being taken away from this carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.751" offset="8062412">Now, I know that -- that my opponent did not intentionally misstate Montgomery's authority but Montgomery's authority is not a point-to-point authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.487" offset="8117269">It is a broad territorial grant of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.004" offset="8131375">It authorizes service between Chicago and Denver on the one hand and on the other, all points in Northern Illinois, all points in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and that portion of Colorado East to the continental divide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.627" offset="8205876">This is an extremely broad territorial authority and permits Montgomery or permitted them as a contract carrier to originate at or deliver shipments at any point within this territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.287" offset="8272541">In response to Mr. Justice White's question, the Commission properly stated the law that as a contract carrier under contract with certain types of shipper, shipments could be originated at or destined to any point within the authorized scope of Montgomery's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.313" offset="8360626">As a converted carrier, Montgomery is limited to movements from, to or between certain points within that territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.464" offset="9169272">And while the lower court did not specifically point out these examples, they -- they assumed that these were territorial restrictions and then dealt with the question of whether the Commission had the statutory power to impose these restrictions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles W. Singer</label>
            <text syncTime="2447.735" offset="9894327">Between the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.592" offset="9901746">And two, whether the Commission had any statutory power at all to impose a restriction of this nature because if the restriction had read -- restricted to movements from, to and between warehouses, suppliers, ports, farms and -- and wholesale and retail department store, that would still be a -- a territorial restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.818" offset="10022640">It would be like the Commission flipping a coin to try to determine that the restriction they impose would allow Montgomery to perform the same operations that they were authorized as a contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.011" offset="10079378">The simple fact is that as a contract carrier under contract for the department store or under contract for the wholesale or retail, meat, fruit and vegetable packing house, they could go from or to any point within their territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.997" offset="10151372">If the -- if the -- a meat packing house told him to go out and -- and pick up some hides, they're out on the farm, they would have the authority to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.420" offset="10197034">If the meat packing company told him to go to a port, Chicago is becoming a great port through the St. Lawrence Seaway, and make a delivery to a customer of Armour or Swift, they could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.206" offset="10264221">But, as a -- as a common carrier, every movement that they have must go from, to or between a wholesale or retail department store or from, to or between a meat, fruit and vegetable packing house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.177" offset="10328064">And if the Commission then -- if this was remanded that the Commission for the purpose of an -- of lessening that, they would have to think of some other points where they thought the carrier might have gone as a contract carrier and I -- I think that -- that even in the infinite wisdom of the Interstate Commerce Commission, they could not conceive of the operations which for the future might be formed by Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.710" offset="10450213">The legislative history of this Act is so clear that nothing would be taken away from the converted carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.935" offset="10495143">We have quoted on pages 21 and 22 of our brief, what I considered to be the controlling legislative history in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.752" offset="10546343">The question was presented to the then Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission, Mr. Clarke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.783" offset="10578526">Is there any constitutional question involved in this conversion?</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.122" offset="10599842">And I think he meant was any property being taken away from these converted carriers without due processes of law and Mr. Chairman Clarke says, "No, I can see none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.984" offset="10651355">It isn't taking away from them anything that they have."</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.978" offset="10675284">And -- and it's clear here and it's admitted by the Government that something is being taken away from them in any restriction that is imposed would take something away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.521" offset="10721468">And Mr. Clarke then goes on to point out that they are given greater opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.945" offset="10751143">They have the opportunity to serve the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.574" offset="10765667">This Court would go back and review its decision in the Noble case which was the decision wherein in this Court affirmed in 1943, the right of the Commission to oppose the original keystone restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.110" offset="10851767">It would find that the Court said that if they should remove the keystone restrictions, it would result in a conversion of the carrier to common carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.603" offset="10901817">For all we're asking this Court to do is to say that -- that since this Conversion Act was enacted by the Commission as a result of -- of your decision in the Contract Steel Carriers case that let's give Montgomery an authority that's a common carrier authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.463" offset="10993246">The imposition of the keystone restrictions were for the specific purpose of preventing it from serving the general public and now the Commission comes along and they say, it's inappropriate for us to impose the keystone type of restriction because of the obligation of the -- of the common carrier -- of a common carrier, but they tried to reward the thing so that Montgomery can't even do as much for its former contracting shippers as it could before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.132" offset="11235871">Now, there is nothing that ties in Section 212 (c) with Section 208 or there's nothing whereby the Commission could have implied that they had the power to try to take the keystone restriction and work it around into what they term something manageable and impose it on the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.955" offset="11327195">The Commission went the great length in imposing the keystone restriction to -- to show that they have the power to the specific statutory language of Section 209.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.498" offset="11373380">This Court in affirming the Interstate Commerce Commission said they -- they derive their power from Section 209, in 209 and in -- in essence said that the Commission had the right to specify the business of the contract carrier and to impose such conditions for limitations as were consistent with the contract carrier's status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.173" offset="11464077">So when you -- when you have one Act or one Section of the Act, where the Commission has the specific statutory power, when you have Section 208 of the Interstate Commerce Act which was the basis for deciding the grandfather applications of -- of common carriers in 1935 where they are specifically given the power to impose restrictions or limitation, how can you say that -- that Congress did not intend -- or that Congress intended to give them the power under Section 212 when they don't even mention it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.624" offset="13777899">That's one of the powers that they have in granting certificates under Section 208 but Section 208 is limited to application under Section 206 or 207.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.055" offset="14003597">It can't -- it can't serve anybody other than who -- the person who's serving for and it can't do as completed job for them as it could before.</text>
