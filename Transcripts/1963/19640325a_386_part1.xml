            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- Federal Power Commission, Petitioner, versus Texaco, Incorporated, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.713" offset="138219">Mr. Wahrenbrock.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="9.881" stopTime="857.750">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock</label>
            <text syncTime="9.881" offset="142921">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.700" offset="174164">This case arose out of the Federal Power Commission's summary rejections of applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity, applications, which had been submitted by producers from natural gas for authority to sell gas to interstate pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.859" offset="274787">The rejections were in accordance with general regulations because the contracts under which the sales were proposed to be made contained indefinite pricing clauses, that is clauses in addition to the normal type which were not prohibited by the regulations such as a provision that gas should be paid for at so many cents per thousand cubic feet and provisions for fixed escalations in such prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.937" offset="431104">That is that the price should go up every year or two or five years by half a cent or a cent, something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.524" offset="469452">Nor other provisions for the reimbursement to the seller of any increases he might incur in taxes, production taxes, severance taxes, gathering taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.601" offset="525772">All of those clauses were allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.897" offset="538937">But the indefinite pricing clauses which were the object of the regulation are further provisions designed to increase the prices fixed under the clauses to which I've already referred, increased to move them up, keep them up to the highest prevailing level, there are variety of such clauses, the second party favored nation clause, which says that if the buyer pipeline pays anybody else a higher price, this price will have to rise equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.223" offset="688253">The third party favored nation clause, if anybody else in the same area or field pays a higher price, this price will rise accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.436" offset="729109">Spiral escalation clauses which provide that if the buyers own prices go up, he must pay his producer a higher price, the kind of provision that was incidentally involved in the -- the Wisconsin case, Wisconsin against the Federal Power Commission, the second Phillips case that was here few years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.442" offset="825135">Redetermination clauses, which provide that at specified times, the price shall be recomputed upon the basis of the highest prevailing prices two or three in average or something of that kind and renegotiation clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.588" offset="893680">The Commission also rejected at the same time the contracts under which the sales were proposed to be made, which were filed as rate schedules or submitted for filing as rate schedules governing the sales if they should be certificated.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.824" offset="966719">Now, there was no question and there is no question here that the regulations applied to the proposed -- the -- the applications which were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.160" offset="1020008">The contracts had been executed after the regulations became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.252" offset="1044355">The clauses fell within the proscribed class and there had been no request for waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.220" offset="1072253">This becomes important later.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.512" offset="1081448">The regulations of the Commission explicitly provide for filing applications for waiver or amendment, or repeal of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.152" offset="1123976">And this -- this provision for waiver was in effect at the time of these rejections and throughout the 30-day period within which these parties had -- which they had in which to file their applications for rehearing, which are prerequisite to going to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.578" offset="1213733">The court below set aside the Commission's rejections on the ground that the regulations were invalid, not because they were unreasonable, the Court didn't reach that question, but because the Commission had no power to issue such regulations it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.308" offset="1284577">It held that the Power Commission cannot deny certificate applications without the hearing provided in the certificate sections of the Act, Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.486" offset="1329298">And that the Commission cannot refuse to allow rates without the hearing provided in Sections 4 and 5, the rate sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.783" offset="1370467">While our petition for certiorari was pending in this Court, the Ninth Circuit in a -- exactly -- in an exactly parallel case, the Superior Oil Company case reached the opposite result, upheld a Commission rejection under corresponding situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.334" offset="1460746">And Superior's petition for certiorari is -- and our acquiescences are pending before this Court because of the square inter circuit conflict on the question, "Can the Federal Power Commission by a general regulation refuse to consider certificate applications and rate filings where the governing contracts contained pricing clauses, the Commission has determined are incompatible with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.375" offset="1588851">These regulations were developed in a series of cautious steps over a period of some eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.122" offset="1619884">The first step was taken in May of 1954 shortly before the Phillips decision holding producer rates and sales subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.715" offset="1674219">The rule-making proceeding was initiated in accordance with the -- the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act for a rule with respect to the clauses of this kind and its chief importance now is in the early recognition or the recognition at least at that time of the existence of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.128" offset="1779858">Two years later, the Commission initiated a second rule-making proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.436" offset="1801070">In the light of the experience, it had by that time had with producer rate filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.340" offset="1828760">And in the light of that experience, it appeared that if indefinite pricing clauses could be proper -- properly and appropriately, outlawed by a general regulation large numbers of questionable increased rates could not be filed under the Mobile rule require -- prohibiting filing of rate increases contrary to the provisions of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.961" offset="1955192">But action was delayed in this rule-making proceeding until a decision was forced on the Commission by the Pure Oil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.738" offset="1994376">Pure Oil, a producer, filed for increases under its favored nation clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.489" offset="2029380">The purchaser, El Paso, objected, said that the favored nation clause had not been activated, had not been triggered by the transaction that it was relied upon, and therefore, under Mobile, the filing could not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.772" offset="2086431">The Public Utilities Commission and the people of California intervened in that proceeding before the Commission contending that these favored nation clauses were as it contended all favored nation clauses were unlawful and void the same contention that was made in the Wisconsin case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.359" offset="2168769">The Commission ruled that they were not void under existing laws and regulations as this Court ruled in the -- in the Wisconsin case, but that they should be outlawed in future contracts and issued its regulation 232 which contains much of the substance of the regulation now in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.195" offset="2264168">The Pure Oil opinion is important here for what it reveals about the indefinite pricing clause problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.892" offset="2294888">And I referred to it not to argue the reasonableness of the regulation because that question was not passed on by the court below and we have not attempted to argue it in our briefs here but to show something of the nature of the problem with which these regulations attempted to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.156" offset="2363956">The first element that the Commission's opinion in the Pure Oil case discloses is that so long as such clauses are allowed, there need be no economic or other substantial justification for the increased rate, it can be filed any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.806" offset="2434591">And as long as it can be, the experience has shown that most in -- almost every case, in most cases, the increase is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.649" offset="2470013">The mere fact that a higher price is paid to some other producer would be sufficient to activate the -- the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.656" offset="2505958">The opinion refers to the lack of any substantial relationship to the factors, which bear on the value of the gas or on a determination of a reasonable level of rate for that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.915" offset="2555068">A second factor discussed in the opinion is the interacting and cumulative effect of these clauses in numerous contracts in the same area, one acting upon the other, triggering the others and this in turn triggering more until a chain reaction is produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.178" offset="2640123">It was estimated by El Paso in that case -- in the Pure Oil case that if that chain reaction which had occurred there stood, El Paso's costs of purchased gas each year would increase from 35 or up to possibly $51 million, the increase of $35 million to $51 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.124" offset="2739911">A third element referred to in the Pure Oil opinion was that the pos -- that the possibility of such increases under indefinite pricing clauses makes it impossible when an application for a certificate is before the Commission for the Commission to judge what the pipelines cost of gas is going to be if the initial price is subject to be increased and the event anybody else increases his price, the Commission cannot determine whether the pipeline addition or the new pipeline should be -- will be economically feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.401" offset="2877001">And the fourth element that the Commission mentioned is that these favored -- these indefinite pricing clauses have given rise to difficult problems of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.214" offset="2920260">Under the Mobile decision, the Court -- the Commission must determine whether an increase filed under one of these clauses maybe accepted whether it is or it's not in accordance with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.486" offset="2973341">And if it is not, it must reject it.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.052" offset="2983581">And this has raised exceedingly difficult and complex questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.437" offset="3001135">One of those questions took seven years to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.237" offset="3024332">It was in the Court's four years came to this Court on the merits once and the second time this Court -- or after the court below had affirmed the Commission's interpretation of the clause, this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.395" offset="3076995">Another one where both factual and legal questions were involved took -- has already taken over four years and it's now pending in the Third Circuit on a record that was made before the Commission of more than 7000 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.630" offset="3137912">And while this preliminary threshold jurisdictional question is being considered and awaits decision by the Commission and by the courts, the Commission is prevented from reaching the question of the reasonableness of the rate which is proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.022" offset="3207502">And that question, the statute says is one that the Commission must give preference to over all other questions pending before it and decide as speedily as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.902" offset="3254941">Now, this indicates the kind of problems that were sought to be dealt with by Order 232.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.360" offset="3276779">And in contract executed thereafter, that Order provided, that indefinite pricing clauses should be inoperative and of no legal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.956" offset="3319202">But the Commission invited further comments and in effect, it enunciated a further rule-making proceeding in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act by inviting further comments and publishing that request in the Federal Register and serving it on natural gas companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.745" offset="3390360">And as a result of the comments which were received, some 30 comments being received, the Commission's substantially modified or ameliorated 232 to permit some indefinite pricing clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.723" offset="3446262">If they were not operative more than once in any five-year period, during which no fixed escalations occurred and if the prices which were used as a point of reference for the increase where prices which were themselves subject to the Commission's jurisdiction and the Commission had not questioned those prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.121" offset="3815842">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.624" offset="3825873">Now, I do want to just first speak of the inadequacies which remained and led to the further -- the final form of this present regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.988" offset="3867355">By outlawing these provisions saying they should be inoperative and of no effect certain inadequacies were still failure to deal with the problems, still remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.926" offset="3907062">The certificate applications and rates which contained such clauses could still be filed with the Commission and if they were filed, even though there was no economic justification or it appeared to be none for them, the Commission would have to conduct a proceeding on each one and they would still produce these chain reactions of which I have spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.053" offset="3999535">So in October of 1961, the Commission issued its third rule-making proceeding and the effect of that was to provide for the rejections.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.347" offset="4044779">That brings us then to the question of whether rejections under such a regulation are valid, whether the Commission has power.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.264" offset="4084381">And we submit that the Federal Power Commission's choice to proceed by regulation rather than as the court below indicated it should by a trial like hearing in every case was basically simply an attempt to deal with a general problem in a general way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.568" offset="4173615">The two-frequent failure of regulatory agencies to do more of this kind of thing was strongly criticized by Mr. James M. Landis and his report to President elected Kennedy in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.251" offset="4232338">His report emphasized that agency should devote more attention to the formulation of policy and to the embodiment of policy in general rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.996" offset="4271313">Instead of getting submerged in the ad hoc adjudication of individual cases and it is interesting that so modest and attempt to do what Mr. Landis urged that a regulation so cautiously developed as this by successive commissioners in office over a span of eight years and a regulation aimed at the problem singled out by Mr. Landis as Exhibit A in his museum of administrative horrors should, in the succeeding three years have drawn us into Court, into Courts of Appeals in 7 -- in 17 cases and ultimately here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.712" offset="4430242">Perhaps the broadest ground on which the Tenth Circuit ruled that the Commission lack of power here was that proceeding by general rule instead of ad hoc adjudication violates the Mobile principle, which Mr. Justice Brennan in the Sunray Mid-Continent case characterized as recognition of the integrity of private contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.090" offset="4531702">But the Tenth Circuit never faces up to the obvious question why does a general regulation violate that principle anymore than case-by-case elimination of indefinite pricing clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.782" offset="4594500">Suppose the Commission were to depend on the case-by-case approach, and I think Mr. Justice Goldberg that I answer your question now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.598" offset="4633788">If in that case, if it were to proceed case-by-case, the Commission would have to accept each producer's certificate application although it was based on a clause or contract that contained such a clause as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.899" offset="4686973">It would have to hold a hearing in all of the usual -- on all of the usual questions of issues of public convenience and necessity such as the level of the initial price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.945" offset="4747160">And in addition, it would have to hold the question on whether this indefinite pricing clause was compatible with the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.113" offset="4783835">Now, probably there would be interventions on questions of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.995" offset="4803375">The Commissions in the States of California and Wisconsin, the Public Service Commission of New York had been intervening.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.450" offset="4841200">There would be an examiner's decision after the hearing and exceptions to it and breathing an oral argument before the Commission and the Commission decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.741" offset="4874324">Now, assume that the Commission should decide in such a case that the indefinite pricing clause is incompatible with the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.651" offset="4905984">Under the teaching of CATCO, it can do one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.250" offset="4916328">It can deny the certificate or it can condition the certificate presumably upon the elimination of the indefinite pricing clause, and the producer can take it or leave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.603" offset="4965752">Each such producer in such a proceeding, case-by-case proceeding, would be in the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.008" offset="4999398">It is in under this general regulation if it applies for a reg -- for a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.927" offset="5031058">It has the same burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.863" offset="5042866">It has the same risk of drainage if there's a risk of drainage pending the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.127" offset="5067839">It has the same possibility of meeting that by emergency steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.479" offset="5093334">The only difference is that the Commission must repeat the same kind of proceeding every time a producer brings it in, scores maybe hundreds of time and decide again the same question, the question which so far as anything that has yet been developed shows there is no substantial difference between cases on and decide that time and again every time a producer comes in and brings it before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.850" offset="5194794">Because unless there is a rule such as we have here, the Commission cannot refuse to consider the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.965" offset="5511189">Well, the Commission has referred to it in the Pure Oil opinion and subsequently as floods of these filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.280" offset="5544521">As this Court as made clear, the choice between the ad hoc adjudicatory process and the general rule-making process is one for the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.868" offset="5594885">In the Chenery case the Court said, this is the second Chenery case, the function of filling in the interstices of the Act should be performed as much as possible through this quasi-legislative promulgation of rules to be applied in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.572" offset="5661654">The choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual ad hoc litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.484" offset="5713272">Now, a closely related ground that seems to be interwoven in the opinion of the court below for the decision it reached, it seems to be that because the statutory restriction of sales of gas to those sales that are required by the public convenience and necessity is coupled in the statute with provisions to accomplish that objective by certificates issued in accordance with the proscribed hearing and other procedural requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.331" offset="5836675">The Commission is barred from using its general rule-making power to aid in accomplishing the same objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.535" offset="5869484">And similarly that because the statutory requirement that contracts relating to rates shall be just and reasonable, it is coupled with provisions to accomplish that objective through hearings to fix just and reasonable rates and contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.397" offset="5936985">The Commission is barred from using its general rule-making powers to aid in accomplishing that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.454" offset="5969168">But we think that the definitive answer to the court below is that this Court has already passed on this question in the Storer case, United States against Storer, in 351 U.S., page 192, opinion written by Mr. Justice Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.963" offset="6043251">And while there were dissents, there was no dissent on this point, no expressed dissent on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.307" offset="6072613">In that case, the Federal Communications rule-making power under which it had acted is certainly no broader than that of the Federal Power Commission under which the Power Commission acted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.190" offset="6124126">The rule, which was promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, was promulgated under the same Administrative Procedure Act provisions under which the Power Commission acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.941" offset="6179088">It invited comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.128" offset="6187865">It did not hold a trial like hearing, the same as true with the Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.333" offset="6208658">That rule of the Federal -- of the Federal Communications Commission barred the issuance of station licenses to any person already interested in more than a specified number of stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.041" offset="6259545">And the Communications Act, like the Gas Act, the Communications Act in the Section 309 provides for the issuance of licenses after a hearing requires that a hearing be held before an application can be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.227" offset="6344286">It was contended in that case that the rule of the Federal Communications Commission was invalid because it constituted a denial of a license application without a hearing, the same ground on which the court below relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.650" offset="6410010">And this Court upheld the Communications Commission's rule in these -- these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.202" offset="6436133">At least I might mention these two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.075" offset="6447626">We agree with the contention of the Commission that a full hearing such as this required by Section 309 would not be necessary on all such applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.347" offset="6492766">As the Commission has promulgated its rules after extensive administrative hearings, it is necessary for the accompanying papers to set forth reasons, sufficient if true to justify a change or waiver of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.818" offset="6558595">We do not think that Congress intended the Commission to waste time on applications that do not state a valid basis for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.773" offset="6606451">Now, that decision of this Court was argued extensively in -- in our briefs and in oral argument to the Commission below, extensively by us and to a certain extent, by our opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.665" offset="6666010">And though it was so argued, it is not even mentioned in the Court's opinion except on another point with relation to jurisdiction, which was also an issue in the Storer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.409" offset="6729017">The Court -- the Tenth Circuit did, however say, argue seems to have been very much impressed with the consideration that there was no possibility of effective judicial review in the absence of a trial-like hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.920" offset="6795055">But as the Ninth Circuit in the Superior case pointed out, this would require that all general rule-making by administrative agencies be based on a trial-like hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.326" offset="6856704">Other courts have found no difficulty in passing on the reasonableness of agency rules adopted by the same procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.081" offset="6887737">That was true in the Storer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.295" offset="6900590">It was true by the Ninth Circuit's Superior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.006" offset="6915427">The Ninth Circuit did pass on the reasonableness of this very regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.283" offset="6932459">It was true in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the recent Public Service Commission of the New York against the Federal Power Commission where the District of Columbia Circuit had under consideration the validity of the Power Commission's regulation governing the issuance of temporary certificates of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.677" offset="7026082">So Tenth Circuit goes on to say that there was no finding by the Commission in haec verba that these provisions of the contracts are not just and reasonable, the finding that is specified in the rate sections of the Act and no explicit finding in haec verba that the clauses are incompatible with the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.714" offset="7150216">But here again, we should point out that the Commission was acting under Section 16, its power to enact general rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.483" offset="7205282">It was not acting under the specific rate and certificate sections which require hearings or require findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.723" offset="7238301">Section 16 requires no finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.676" offset="7250108">It only specifies that the rule be one which is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.208" offset="7284172">The procedures for accomplishing that kind of rule-making have been prescribed in the Administrative Procedure Act, Section 4 (b) of that Act, provides for participation by the submission of comments, data, and argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.921" offset="7351045">But expressly -- expressly says that this may or may not be in the discussion of the agency include oral presentation of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.715" offset="7406216">In Section 4 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act does not require any findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.421" offset="7433070">It only specifies that after consideration of all relevant matter presented, the agency shall incorporate in any rules adopted a concise, general statement of their basis and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.320" offset="7488658">There is no contention that the Power Commission has failed to comply with that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.849" offset="7514781">And even if we go on to argue in our brief, even if the hearing requirements of Sections 4 and 5 and 7 were applicable and did have to be made, the Commission's statements made in issuing Order 232.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.517" offset="7593462">And in -- by reference in its opinion in the Pure Oil case, we show under repeated decisions are sufficient to meet the substance of the findings requirements of those sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.902" offset="7658977">Now, insofar as the Tenth Circuit rested on the ground that the Commission lacks power to regulate contracts under the principle of the Mobile case, we submit that it is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.746" offset="7738389">Because there was no question before this Court in the Mobile case of the Commission's power to regulate contracts and no decision reached on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.101" offset="7783737">The question there was of the Company's power to file rate increases with the Commission in violation of its contracts, not of the Commission's power to regulate contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.994" offset="7839326">And though there was no question of the Commission's power to regulate contracts, this Court was careful in the opinion written for the Court by Mr. Justice Harlan to make it plain that it had not passed on that question and that there should be no implication of that kind drawn from the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.683" offset="7906095">Because it is stated in that opinion at page 344 and I quote a part of the language, "denying to natural gas companies the power unilaterally to change their contracts in no way impairs the regulatory powers of the Commission for the contracts remained fully subject to the paramount power of the Commission, to modify them when necessary in the public interest."</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.825" offset="8022706">This reading was confirmed in the subsequent opinion of this Court in the Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Company case where Mr. Justice Brennan wrote the opinion for the Court and he said this, "The short of the matter is that Mobile recognized that there were two sources of price and supply stability inherent in the regulatory system established by the Natural Gas Act, the provisions of private contracts and the public regulatory power."</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.841" offset="8154781">Now in our brief, we review the explicit language of Sections 4 and 5, and the numerous cases which have uniformly upheld Commission orders requiring modifications of contract, uniformly upheld Commission orders requiring modifications of contracts, done so both in cases on the regulation of rates and service and in cases involving the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.838" offset="8286751">Now, I believe that it is unnecessary at this time to shake more time here on that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.636" offset="9657866">Texaco, one of the two respondents here, after having taken several previous cases for involving Federal Power Commission orders to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and then having taken one to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit under the Principal Place of Business Clause of Section 19 (b) of the Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.560" offset="9777612">In this case, went to the Tenth Circuit under a claim that it, Texaco, is located in the Tenth Circuit within the meaning of Section 19 (b), although under the normal meaning of the word "located" as the legal residence which in the case of a corporation is the state in which it is incorporated, Texaco should have gone to the Third Circuit, it being incorporated in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.494" offset="9913344">But the Tenth Circuit held that it had venue this -- of this case and there are, in its opinion, at least three discernible grounds for that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.395" offset="9968933">The first is, its statement in its opinion that Texaco and I quote, "conducts extensive operations in that circuit referring to the Tenth Circuit."</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.704" offset="10022222">But if "located" is the equivalent of the place where extensive business is done, Congress would not have needed to have added in Section 19 (b) a provision for venue upon the basis of the principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.726" offset="10118248">If doing some business, if doing extensive business is enough, Congress wouldn't have had, then go on and add a principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.696" offset="10174151">In fact, the Tenth Circuit's opinion deprives the language of principal place of business as any meaning or purpose in Section 19 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.562" offset="10221589">It makes it a pure redundancy in violation of the -- the usual important and helpful rules of statutory interpretation that meaning shall be given to all provisions of the statute if that's reasonably possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.897" offset="10294941">The Tenth Circuit admitted in its opinion, admitted as much, when it said that there was overlapped in the provisions and it has -- it had construed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.156" offset="10336005">But it said that the overlap was for the purpose of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.712" offset="10354186">Well, that doesn't seem to be any need for clarity if the clauses are properly interpreted and probably, this kind of an explanation could be made in -- against every case in which courts attempt to give meaning to all provisions of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.858" offset="10434853">And it's not necessary here because if lo -- located is construed in its normal meaning of legal residence and principal place of business is given its normal meaning, both are given meaning, both are consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.893" offset="10506951">The second ground on which the Tenth Circuit seems to have denied venue -- or upheld venue is this and I quote its language."</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.668" offset="10546030">More importantly, the gas is produced in the Tenth Circuit and the performance of the contract occurs in the Tenth Circuit."</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.875" offset="10590856">Now, that maybe a good conflict of laws' rule for determining the State whose laws shall govern the contract but there is no authority that we know of in statute or in case law or anywhere for the proposition that Texaco's performance of its contract in the Tenth Circuit shows that Texaco is located, the company is located there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.235" offset="12624332">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.068" offset="12639692">To clarify one point about the matters of substance, I am appearing on behalf of Pan American Petroleum Corporation, who is also a respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.928" offset="12683055">As to it, there is no venue of question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.072" offset="12699669">Mr. DeCrane, who will follow me, will respond as to the venue of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.875" offset="12718895">My remarks are directed solely to the question of validity of these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.209" offset="12744182">At the outset, I would say that the Commission counsel referred to Dean Landis report and made reference to museums of administrative horrors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.752" offset="12782425">In our view, the Tenth Circuit correctly consigned these particular regulations to that museum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.505" offset="12817429">The important thing before the Court today is that these regulations do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.967" offset="12843238">They're not only purport to declare in operative and therefore, outlaw certain types of contract clauses that historically have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.242" offset="12892348">They also prescribed affirmatively the only permissible clauses that hereafter may be used by producers in selling natural gas in interstate commerce to pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.353" offset="12948773">The Commission, therefore, did two substantive things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.163" offset="12967999">Commission counsel has argued primarily a form of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.837" offset="12986702">I would like to direct the Court's attention primarily to the substance of what the Commission has done because the gist of the holdings of the Tenth Circuit relates to the substance of the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.026" offset="13055457">That holding is, first, that the Commission has no substantive powers to prescribe or proscribe clauses in this fashion in advance of its review of the contracts as to which it is acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.765" offset="13122435">The Tenth Circuit, in our view, correctly read this Court's opinion in the Mobile case to lay out the dichotomy under this statute of the powers of the Commission on -- on the one hand with respect to contracts and the powers left to regulated companies with respect to contracts on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.951" offset="13207176">The Court there held that this Act did not abrogate contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.349" offset="13224730">The Court further pointed out that the Commission's power with respect contracts is that of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.465" offset="13257226">Review of contracts in the Court's language made in the first instance by regulated companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.597" offset="13289723">I would like to illustrate briefly what in our view is the proper operation of this Act with respect to contracts under the constructions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.444" offset="13341132">We are not in the position that the Commission apparently would put us in saying to the Court that the Commission has no power to change contracts, the questions actually are, "How upon what facts in applying what standards the Commission may outlaw contracts and then prescribe alternatives in substantives?"</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.369" offset="13668812">And it specifically says, "That anyone who comes to the Commission with a contract that contains a clause different from those that were previously set out in the Order 232A, is denied the hearing that Section 7 specifies and is relegated to a status under which he has no right of hearing, he -- his contract is never judged under the Act's standards and he is told that the only clause he may have is a clause such as that set forth in Order 232.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.397" offset="13836936">And those clauses themselves have not been tested under the Act's standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3714.604" offset="14961768">Now, our position is as to existing contracts and clauses in those proceedings with the California Commission there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.279" offset="14992488">With us there, the Commission staff there and the technicians and the questions that are involved when you prescribe and proscribe clauses, there's a fact finding process, a decision consistent with the statutory standards would have to come out with respect to contracts that are not yet written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.966" offset="15083186">As we read Mobile, the Commission is without substantive power to pull out of the blue the clauses that will be in those contracts to post the rule and say from this day forward, the only contracts that are consistent with public convenience and necessity and just and reasonable of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.131" offset="15179943">Now, our reason for that is historically this, and I would emphasize just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.487" offset="15213275">That is a rate regulatory standard with constitutional routes and you apply it to facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3840.297" offset="15464573">It removes the decision on a clause from the statutory standards that Congress has set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.296" offset="15496547">Instead of having a proceeding under Section 7 as to public convenience and necessity or a proceeding under Section 4 or 5 where just and reasonable as the standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3870.007" offset="15583378">It maybe the whim of the various -- I don't mean this derogatorily but commissioners are birds of passage in the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.542" offset="15629563">It is removing the decision that is made on the most vital part of a contract, the rate fixing provisions from the statutory standards that Congress set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.839" offset="15682748">Now, the practical part of it is probably more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.794" offset="15702497">It is not possible once this Court decides this case, assuming it affirmed the Commission for a producer to get a contract upon which to seek waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.919" offset="15751084">The hooker in it is a provision of Order Number 242 that applies to the pipeline companies as well as the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.432" offset="15785148">There is a provision that if a pipeline company, which has to get a certificate also, comes before the Commission with a reserve, a gas supply that is covered by a contract with one of the so-called odious clauses in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.448" offset="15849200">That reserve and that gas supply, the Commission will not consider as committed to pipeline, that goes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.301" offset="15880547">Now, a pipeline cannot get a certificate without a reserve showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.429" offset="15901132">In fact, it also cannot get financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.355" offset="15916805">So that places on the other side of the bargaining table, from the pipeline side, an impediment in ever putting that pipeline's name on a contract that has a provision other than this that have been posted on the board by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.095" offset="15983783">There have been and -- to our knowledge in this vague area that we're in now until there's a final decision, cases that I would call flukes, and in fact that two that are before this Court today are, they result in part from misunderstanding of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.914" offset="16062986">The Commission had referred to the Atlantic two-way route cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.077" offset="16087646">Texaco, in the blue colored brief before you, I believe in the appendix has set out for this Court exactly what has happened in those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.898" offset="16131009">In the first case, a so-called hearing was started and all of the evidence with respect to the contract clause except the name and qualifications of the witness was stricken on the grounds that it was a question of law that the contract complied with these regulations or did -- or did it not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.437" offset="16221080">All the evidence was not even received.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.782" offset="16234454">The next Atlantic Clause which resulted in a granting of rehearing ultimately resulted in the fact that because of economic and business compulsion, Atlantic could not hold out and it no longer has the clause and therefore, there is no such hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.076" offset="16323688">It is quite true that in theory, that may appear to have a gloss of some type of out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.654" offset="16369977">But in practice, it does not -- and we would say, even if it purported to, the Commission cannot remove the testing of applications from Section 7 and from the public convenience and necessity test and make the standards something unwritten, unknown and unstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.392" offset="16460988">It also cannot remove the decision as to a just and reasonable clause from that standard of the Section 4 or 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.788" offset="16498500">I would say quite frankly that there is quite a bit more involved to the problem than just these particular clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.508" offset="16529429">Because the standards of this statute that are involved here and the test for determining whether a clause meets the statutory standard are also the procedures and the standards that apply to fixing the rate level itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.464" offset="16605184">There is no -- would be no difference at all between what the Commission did here than setting up a notice as it did here in giving people 17 days to comment and these comments incidentally are not served by another participants and then coming out with a rule and saying, "These are the permissible rates in certain areas."</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.156" offset="16708002">Now, as the Court knows in the Wisconsin case, the Commission has come out with a statement of general policy that sets out in areas' particular rate levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.850" offset="16754813">The Commission bear, makes known to the industry that if you come in with a contract with a rate that is higher than that, you are going to have to go to hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.935" offset="16799117">The Tenth Circuit has left standing in the same posture, this Order 232A.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.670" offset="16826075">It says that the Commission certainly can leave Order 232A standing as an expression of the Commission's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.621" offset="16857840">Every producer in the country is on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.510" offset="16873409">You are guided by that if you come to the Commission as we did with this renegotiation clause, operating in 1983, a clause that is not accord with Order 232A.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.623" offset="16933909">The -- all that the Tenth Circuit requires is that with such a clause, the Section 7 process be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.220" offset="16968286">Now, when we would arrive at the Commission with that clause, we of course have the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.667" offset="16993991">The 20 or so other producers were involved in the same project and in the pipeline would be in the same hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.692" offset="17022098">This can be looked at in relation to the particular area in Wyoming to the predictions as to what will be our requirements over the life of this contract to have access to filings under Section 4 and the Commission can write a reasoned determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.795" offset="17094510">If this clause falls, then the question then is a substitute which would also enable us to have access to Section 4 of the Act and therein the form in which we may attempt down the road to prove a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.183" offset="17172146">In our view substantively, what the Commission has done is create a straitjacket which it had no power to do in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.911" offset="17207045">It has done it in a manner that the Act does not commit and has placed us in the position as we are here today before this Court with no record upon which we can refute or respond to the condemnation that the Court heard for roughly an hour of these contract clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.187" offset="17300146">As the Court may note in view of the holding below, the only record that is before this Court today because of the way the Commission has proceeded in its view of rule-making consist solely of the papers that we filed before the Commission, a letter rejecting our application and the regulations on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.833" offset="17394709">There is no record here from the rule-making proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.415" offset="17409024">There is no record here on the questions or to substantiate the argument that Mr. Wahrenbrock made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.886" offset="17446954">There is no record here that would substantiate our questioning of the statements he made or our attempts to show that the particular renegotiation clause that we have here is compatible with the public convenience and necessity standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.482" offset="17521351">I think in -- in brief, the Tenth Circuit reading this Court's decision in Mobile, citing what this Court said in Memphis about the importance of flexibility under this statute correctly concluded that the Commission is without substantive power to prescribe clauses in advance because of the nature of the function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.017" offset="17627408">It also correctly concluded that when the Commission acts as to clauses like this and bearing in mind that it is doing two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.080" offset="17663666">It is wiping out, one and prescribing another, and both have to be just and reasonable according to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.959" offset="17695222">When it is doing that Act, the Tenth Circuit holds that the Act's specification of hearing is required because that requires fact finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.737" offset="17746317">The Tenth Circuit, likewise, holds that the standard of the Act must be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.995" offset="17771395">Now, the Tenth Circuit has looked at what the Commission has said and has correctly concluded that everything that the Commission discussed in promulgating these rules could be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.113" offset="17827819">But these still are not the relevant factors that control determining public convenience and necessity under this statute or justness and reasonableness, both of which are standards that have been construed by this Court, both of which are imported into this statute from the long history of federal regulation of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.927" offset="17931055">And they have that history back of them whether they're being applied to a pipeline, a producer or any other regulated entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.456" offset="17973164">Now, the fourth conclusion that the Tenth Circuit reached is that the methods that the Commission has here used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.136" offset="18003884">That is a so-called nonreviewable general order and a rejection letter operate to bar the Courts under Section 19 (b) of this Act from ever reviewing a decision as to propriety of a clause upon a factual record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.309" offset="18096567">The record that is presently before the Court is I think an example of the correctness of the Tenth Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.591" offset="18141706">I would like to mention just briefly what in our view the Commission is empowered to do and which the Tenth Circuit recognized, because we are as much concerned about how the Commission proceeds as it is the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.165" offset="18212028">First of all, the policy pronouncement method which Section 16 would permit is left to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.982" offset="18259257">These views of the Commission as to a specific clause are left standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.471" offset="18297292">The Commission, likewise, may consider these clauses or any other on consolidated bases under Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.986" offset="18331355">And as I mentioned earlier, that has always and historically been in relation to specific pipeline projects and specific areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.357" offset="18368763">The Commission, likewise, is left free to consider all of these clauses in the area rate proceedings under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.314" offset="18400632">We have cited in our brief the fact that today, the Commission has already in operation four of these proceedings and those four are said by the Commission to cover 75% of the gas that is presently moving in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.200" offset="18468133">In proceedings of that type, we may be heard persons who have views about these clauses may be heard and as I said, the result that comes out would be consistent with the just and reasonable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.719" offset="18550262">The last point that I would like to emphasize is that a long-term contract is something that the producer has to live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.687" offset="18598118">The Commission requires a pipeline to come to the Commission with a long term committed gas supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.899" offset="18626957">As the Court recognized in discussing the pipeline's problem in Memphis, this obviously means that when you sit down in 1963 to write a contract that is going to apply you -- to you, and in my client's case, this will be the next 30 years until the gas is completely exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.698" offset="18706160">You are going to have to have clauses that permit you to have access to Section 4 of this Act and if they're going to have any meaning at all, they cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.128" offset="18751927">Our guess now and can coning specific prices for 1970, 1975, 1983 and on to 1999, if they have any significance or meaning at all, they have to be related to external factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.918" offset="18823084">The Memphis Clause that the pipeline uses isn't related anything at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.567" offset="18841684">It simply says that the going rate and the pipeline is free to file a rate anytime it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.586" offset="18865716">This is the clause that was before the Court in Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.736" offset="18878360">Our clauses are far, far more limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.740" offset="18894346">Our view is that after a Section 7 hearing and after the area rate cases, when the Commission has finally decided what are the facts that determined reasonable rates under this statute, which is this Court knows the Commission has not yet done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.854" offset="18966758">When that is done, what should emanate from the area rate cases will be clauses which would be related to those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.534" offset="19005524">I think in a large measure, we could say that what the Commission has attempted to do here is wholly premature because it has been before this Court twice in the past two years telling the Court that today and until it decides that the first area rate case, it will not know and cannot tell this Court what specific facts determine reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.275" offset="19104475">Then how can the Commission today or in 1961 say that clauses in existence are not related to reasonable rates?</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.632" offset="19145853">It cannot answer that question until it answers the question of what facts generate a reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.779" offset="19178454">Having answered that, it then can look at clauses and if the external facts specified are not relevant to reasonableness, then that clause may fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.683" offset="19222131">And what the Commission prescribed that then should be related to its reasonableness factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.861" offset="19246791">Today, however, it has done this completely in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.045" offset="19263509">There is no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.042" offset="19267584">There has been no finding of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.643" offset="19277928">There has been solely comment and as to clauses not even in existence, the Commission has attempted to exercise powers that it does not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.396" offset="19324949">In our view, we are willing to sustain any burden of proof that the Act places upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.690" offset="19354102">But we believe the Tenth Circuit has correctly concluded that the Commission here is guilty of over reaching and that it must be channeled back into the Section 7, Section 4, and Section 5 process, both as to procedure and as to substantive standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.006" offset="19431424">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5436.441" offset="21849109">I would like to expand on a question just ask to counsel Gilliam by Mr. Justice Clark as to what would happen if this rule were sustained because there is in effect before the Court, substantially and basically, a power question, of question of power of this Commission under the statute which proscribes its responsibilities, the statute which was written by the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.836" offset="21954748">This Court has said on frequent occasions that under the Natural Gas Act, the consumer of natural gas has been given a complete and comprehensive scope of protection against exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.399" offset="22005008">But let's examine that for a minute because I believe that it cannot be denied, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.115" offset="22023816">That if you sustain what the Federal Power Commission has done here, there is nothing to prevent this Commission tomorrow from issuing a rule-making notice stating that after June 1, 1964, no contract will accepted for filing by this Commission which contains a price that exceeds 20 cents per 1000 cubic feet or a price that is less than 18 cents for 1000 cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.613" offset="22165817">Now, the consumers of natural gas may well feel that these prices are not in the range of what is just and reasonable and may seek the petition for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.012" offset="22199463">But when they petition for review from this rule, that is finally promulgated, they will be met as we were met by a record that contains absolutely no facts whatsoever by a Court of Appeals which says, "This is a bootstraps operation," if I ever saw one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.566" offset="22265605">And by the monster that Mr. Justice White was afraid off when he wrote the Burlington Truck Lines decision reported in 371, when he said that, "If we leave these agencies solely to their expertise, we shall have created a monster."</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.107" offset="22335822">Now, you said this can't happen under the Natural Gas Act, the Commission cannot promulgate a rule or regulation that says, "There'll be price of 20 cents, a minimum of 18 cents --"</text>

            <text syncTime="5624.599" offset="22601749">Because we contested the fact that they didn't really follow 4 (b) but we said that, "You didn't follow the second sentence of Section 4 (b)."</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.516" offset="22637484">So saying that we didn't contest they followed the first one is not really a statement of our position because the first sentence doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.378" offset="22664861">And this was the point I was starting to make a second ago, Your Honors that, why can't the Commission promulgate a rule or regulation that would establish what the price will be here after and permit no challenge, no facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.163" offset="22711986">Only because Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act says that the Federal Power Commission can only set a side a price for a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.038" offset="22751483">Remember, both are in the same sections, their authority over the setting aside of a rate as well as their authority over setting aside a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.961" offset="22795264">They are both spelled out in Section 5 (a) of the Natural Gas Act, and that Section says that the Commission may not set aside a rate and it may not prescribe any rate or any contract for the future unless there has been a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.139" offset="22863914">Now, Section 4 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act says that, "In a rulemaking proceeding where some other statute requires a hearing, then no rule can be promulgated without a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.684" offset="22950118">Now, it gets a little complex because we have to look at the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.788" offset="22962552">We have to look first at the Natural Gas Act which sets out the basic powers, responsibilities and scope of authority and then we must construe it along with the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5726.005" offset="23007378">Back in the time the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, Mr. Justice Clark was serving as the Attorney General of the United States, the office of the Attorney General, and the Department of Justice played a substantial role in the passage of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.022" offset="23059414">It helped Congress to investigate the various agency procedures and to offer comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.216" offset="23080208">It went further and set out after the Administrative Procedure Act was published, a handbook for the agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.691" offset="23106121">I wish to guide them to bring their rules, regulations and operations within the scope of this new legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.835" offset="23130676">And in there, the pages cited in our brief, the Attorney General and the Department of Justice decided what sentence 1 and sentence 2 of Section 4 (b) of the APA mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.566" offset="23177592">This -- this is the rule-making provision that the Commission claims to have followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.448" offset="23201207">"There, it is set forth that where another statute such as the Natural Gas Act," said the Attorney General at that time, "requires a hearing before the promulgation of a rule."</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.453" offset="23249168">Then that hearing must be allowed under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.744" offset="23270379">As Mr. Justice Goldberg brought out before and Chief Justice's question to Mr. Wahrenbrock, there is no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5797.921" offset="23295039">We're bothered to Mr. Chief Justice, by the fact that the Commission doesn't know how many of the filings are triggered by the clauses they've precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5805.407" offset="23325027">We raised that point in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.156" offset="23332028">They don't know anything else about any of these clauses either and we've asked for an opportunity to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.054" offset="23355538">If you look at page 46 of this record, you will find in our contract the clause that prescribes that if at sometime during this sale which will go on for some 20 years, it is necessary for the pipeline to treat the gas because it becomes contaminant in the reservoir and it is produced in a state that the pipeline cannot take into its system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.614" offset="23441847">The parties will negotiate and attempt to determine an adjustment in the price in order to take care of the pipeline's cost of doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.460" offset="23477164">Now, these are the problems we've faced in trying to negotiation contracts that are going to be in effect for 20 years and longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.053" offset="23503600">But if you also turn with finger in page 46 of this record -- to page 20 of the record, the page to which Mr. Gilliam referred you earlier, where the Commission has prescribed attack on the church door as it were, the precepts that we may follow in writing contracts, you'll find that this clause is not included nor is anything like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.864" offset="23594820">You will also find in the record and you also heard the Commission tell the Court this morning that there is no economic relationship between the types of clauses which have been proscribed and those which -- and -- and a producer's problems or a natural gas company's problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.636" offset="23661902">What more direct economic relationship is there than the fact that if the gas becomes contaminated and it cost money to do something about it, the parties will sit down and determine on the basis of the costs, what adjustments should be made of the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.726" offset="23722297">Now, you heard a lot about spiral clauses and favored nations' clauses, but you didn't hear anything about this type of clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.390" offset="23748942">But this is the type of clause which is also precluded and it is not included in those clauses which the Commission has prescribed for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.924" offset="23791052">We claim they can't do it because there is no finding that such clauses as I have just described are unjust and unreasonable and there is equally no finding before this Court, no record that you may look to as to why the clauses that were prescribed might be just and reasonable, which the Commission must find under Section 5 (a) of the Gas Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="6274.641" offset="25201977">Well essentially, what the Court here found in Storer was that the action of the Commission in promulgating the rules was in keeping with a fundamental statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6283.744" offset="25238340">But that is the exact opposite of this situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6286.952" offset="25251192">In the Memphis case, this Court considered the Natural Gas Act and found that it was essential for natural gas companies to have flexibility in their pricing so that they could keep the inflow and outflow of dollars and funds generally in balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.908" offset="25319006">But what has been prescribed here as you have heard the Solicitor of the Commission phrased it, is the elimination of flexibility, the elimination of flexible indefinite pricing clauses that permit something like that, so that is one essential difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.804" offset="25378565">The holding here is completely at variance with the holding below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6322.119" offset="25391835">Number two, this Court found in Storer that in promulgating those rules and regulations, the Commission -- the Federal Communications Commission had in fact applied the statutory standard of public interest, convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6337.729" offset="25454320">There has been no application of the statutory standard of justness and reasonableness in the findings or promulgations here that certain contracts -- certain contract pricing provisions are the only pricing provisions that should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.246" offset="25520358">In other words, there is this fundamental variance in the action of the Commission has taken here with the underlying statute that did not exist in Storer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.987" offset="25555362">In Storer, the Federal Communications Commission, under the Communications Act, is permitted to make findings as to the public interest, convenience and necessity without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6373.693" offset="25598098">Here, the Natural Gas Act specifically requires that there must be a hearing before that statute may be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="6391.859" offset="25670823">Yes, Your Honor, and there's an additional point of -- of substantial variance and that under the Communications Act, the FCC has absolutely no jurisdiction over rights, insofar as that section, the broadcast section is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.811" offset="25722650">Here, we're talking about the fundamental problem of the rate that a private party will be allowed to sell in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.678" offset="25754102">That to me is another substantial difference and for a court, such as the Ninth Circuit did to say that there is no difference between the situation in Storer and the underlying statute than -- than there is here, is -- is completely an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="6427.445" offset="25813138">The additional point that -- and another error of similar vain, an underlying error made by the Ninth Circuit in its decision on this -- on this similar matter was where it stated, of course the Commission has followed the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.338" offset="25876773">I tried to point out when I opened my remarks to the Court that they had done precisely the contrary, that the Administrative Procedure Act says that "in order to promulgate a rule," and mind you, Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act is a rule-making proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.906" offset="25939048">It is a proceeding whereby rates and charges for the future will be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6464.519" offset="25961409">That's rule-making under the definition in Section 2 of the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.936" offset="25983143">Thus, how the Commission can say, the rule-making statute of the Natural Gas Act says there must be a hearing before we can promulgate a price or a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.726" offset="26022327">And then say we don't have to follow that rule-making proceeding because the APA sets it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.391" offset="26044897">It most assuredly does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.335" offset="26052733">The Administrative Procedure Act, Your Honors, insist that where the underlying statute provides for a hearing, that hearing, that taking of evidence, that development of fact must be had, one in order to support findings that certain clauses should not be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6503.375" offset="26116890">And two, in order support -- to support a finding that only some other type of clause will be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6510.783" offset="26146461">Now, Your Honors, in the remaining minutes, I must confess that I'm the guilty party on the question of venue which intrigued the Court during Mr. Wahrenbock's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6517.897" offset="26174986">Texaco filed a suit in the -- in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6520.170" offset="26184077">We have briefed at -- this question at length in our brief and we feel that substantially all the points are covered there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.420" offset="26209050">There are perhaps two that I shall raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.781" offset="26218454">One is the question of redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6530.878" offset="26226918">The Commission places great weight on the fact that if our interpretation is sustained by this Court, there would be a redundancy in the Section 19 (b) of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6541.001" offset="26267355">I have two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.233" offset="26272266">One, I don't believe that redundancy is inherent because the Natural Gas Act defines natural gas companies as anyone selling in interstate commerce or at least among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.224" offset="26308315">That is done by individuals as well as corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.331" offset="26320645">So as to individuals, there -- if our -- there would be no redundancy when the -- when the Act is -- is applied insofar as this point of resides his concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.324" offset="26360665">Secondly, redundancy is not really as horrible as it seems because if you look to the general venue of the statute, 28 U.S.C. 1391 (c), corporations are described in a wholly redundant term.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.517" offset="26417403">They are described as where they're doing business or where they're incorporated and it -- it -- it's a complete overlap that Congress has used there but no one has knocked down the statute as being invalid or the fact that it shouldn't be interpreted as it obviously reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6592.612" offset="26473827">And that Section is also helpful on another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6595.567" offset="26485635">It is helpful on this point that -- I believe it was Mr. Justice Goldberg who asked or Mr. Justice Stewart, "What was so awkward about using the term "resides" insofar as a corporation was concerned?"</text>
