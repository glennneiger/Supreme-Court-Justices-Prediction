            <label>Mr. Scott P. Crampton</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">May it please the Court, we would like to comment briefly on the general approach of the government by looking at other statutes that have been enacted in this ten-year period to the extent that, that might be at all pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.036" offset="175522">It seems to us that there is no clear pattern evident from these enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.032" offset="195480">In some of them, Congress said to taxpayers, we're going to give you a benefit, but if you want to take advantage of this benefit why then we want you to file a claim for refund within six months or a year or some shorter period.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.914" offset="251068">It seems to us that that's clearly within the power of Congress to shorten that.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.819" offset="270608">In one instance Congress in 1951, changed the law to give taxpayers a retroactive benefit for the years 1941 to 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.020" offset="319404">In other words they went back ten years, but as here they said nothing about the Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.081" offset="351692">The problem was presented to Congress in 1955 and Congress then amended the original amendment to provide for filing claims and in the legislative history said they wanted to correct what was apparently an oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.865" offset="414804">It seems logical to us to think that if this matter had been presented to Congress specifically that was regard to Section 117 (q) it would have probably corrected what it may have considered to have been an oversight just as it did in the 1951 Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott P. Crampton</label>
            <text syncTime="106.628" offset="529847">For the benefit of serviceman killed an action I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.018" offset="543431">It was some type of a remedy that they waned to give serviceman or their beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.332" offset="572688">We submit that in determining the issue here, the court should look to Section 117 (q) alone and that in doing so it should be remembered that this statute created entirely new rights as to professional inventors and as to taxpayers having any problem with the holding period it made those rights expressly applicable to the year 1952, which was otherwise barred here and the same would be true of 1951, and that under well established rules in statutory construction, the new legalization is entitled to a reasonable construction to make it fully effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.816" offset="742588">We believe that the holding of the court of claims does so by giving full effect to Section 117 (q) and by then applying the Statute of Limitations to Section 117 (q) from the time of its enactment to the extent that this constructive payment may seen like somewhat of a new concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.269" offset="832449">It occurs thus that it just the reverse of the coin in that the Internal Revenue Service is often collecting taxes on theories of constructive payment and it's a situation where perhaps the same rules should work both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.508" offset="893367">Finally, it seems to us that if there is any doubt in the interpretation of this problem that the interpretation should be against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue because of his position in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.924" offset="951045">We submit that it is poor tax administration for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to tell people in this four-year period that they should report their royalties as ordinary income and then after Congress changes the law to come into this Court and in substance say well you shouldn't have believed what I told, you should have filed claims for refund even though as we say from a point of view of a profession inventor there was absolutely no basis for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.811" offset="1070582">In short, this taxpayer should not be penalized for having followed the government's instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.430" offset="1097122">As to this particular statute applied to this particular taxpayer, it seems to us that the Court of Claims was entirely correct in saying that the entire enactment would have been an idle gesture if Congress in giving this benefit for 1952 did not intend taxpayers to get benefit because of the previously outstanding Statute of Limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.689" offset="1494079">This is a statement made by The Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Congressman Mills in connection with 1960 Amendment, which was passed by both houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.316" offset="1540681">It was subsequently vetoed by the President, but this is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.640" offset="1557922">The amendments contained in HR 6482 will apply to calendar years beginning after 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.520" offset="1585403">Since the effective date provision does not refer to a period of limitations for claiming credit or refund no refunds or credits will be allowed where the calendar year involved is closed by the running of the Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.802" offset="1646529">Now, this is a general principle and we submit that this principle will become absolutely clear to anyone who reads all these 47 measures that we've set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.422" offset="1705044">In isolation it's hard to convey this, I think, in oral argument, but, I think, a reading of all these statutes, a reading of the 30 statutes in which Congress has specifically dealt with this problem makes it perfectly clear that Congress itself is applying the rule that we say should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.656" offset="1786023">Now, that being true I don't think a Court can really go beyond that.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.026" offset="1847463">No, we say for the purpose of this case it makes absolutely no difference and the reason we say that is if we are correct that Congress in enacting 117 (q) did not intend to reopen barred years for amateurs, for example, clearly they didn't intend to reopen barred years for professionals, because as the legislative history shows I don't think Congress was concerned or perhaps only interdentally concerned with the professional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.521" offset="1977448">The amateur problem was what they were directing their attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.120" offset="1991868">I think the only reason that professionals, in fact, are covered by this legislation is that the legislative solution Congress adopted was to in corporate in 117 (q) almost verbatim the language of Section 1235.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.300" offset="2060622">This was the 1954 Code prospective provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.015" offset="2075460">Now, it was concerned with three problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.713" offset="2090193">As I said before, 117 (q) was concerned with only one of those three, but it happened to just adopt the language so that in substantive terms it actually covers all three, but in terms of retroactive effect, it was only directed, I think, at one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.089" offset="2167724">I'd just like to say one other thing about the question whether Congress thought it was extending or restricting the law otherwise applicable when it adopted these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.073" offset="2211715">On Pages 27 to 32 of our brief, we've set out a number of statutes in which the legislative history makes it perfectly clear, I think, that Congress thought it was providing relief otherwise barred when it added these express provisions reopening barred years.</text>
