            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="12.689" offset="154102">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.329" offset="168730">Yesterday, I pointed out that this case and the Servette case to follow focused upon the words that appear in our comparative print of the statute on page 2, just below the middle of that page, “making it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce for the purpose where an objective is to induce him to stop dealing with some other person to induce the -- to coerce the primary employ -- the secondary employer for the purpose of requiring him to stop doing business with the primary employer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="62.036" offset="351483">Those words were added to the statute in 1959, and I've pointed out that one of the reasons for adding them was in order to move the protection for both the primary and secondary employer back from where it had been under the original Act where there could -- was no unfair labor practice and could be no protection until there had been inducement to the secondary employer's distraint back to the points of threats before any harm had actually eventuated, but it was made quite clear in the course of the debate that this was not intended to reach request to the secondary employer or persuasion of the secondary employer voluntarily to stop doing business with the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.223" offset="540296">These words were put into the statute after the bill had left the Senate, after the bill had left the House Labor Committee, and on the Floor of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.820" offset="590660">When they were put in by the House, a second controversy arose, which is also of the essence and in some respects closer to these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.569" offset="633605">And, that had to do with the bearing of the words “on efforts to induce consumers not to buy a product from a secondary employer, or perhaps not to deal with the secondary employer at all, for the purpose of making him stop doing business with the primary employer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="155.940" offset="727124">Under the Taft-Hartley version of Section 8 (b)(4), it was all together clear that that conduct was not unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.738" offset="762337">To put the illustration that was used in a memorandum circulated by Senator Kennedy and Congressman Thompson, they used the illustration of a strike against the Coors Brewery up in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.222" offset="820224">And, they pointed out that under the Taft-Hartley version, while it would be an unfair labor practice to induce the employees of packing stores or bars and taverns not to handle Coors beer, or to go on strike, or to induce the truck drivers not to deliver it to the taverns or packing stores, that it would have been permissible under the earlier statute to persuade the public not to buy that product in the packing stores or taverns.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.419" offset="941014">And, that this language “threaten, coerce, or restrain any person” would cutoff what they described is one of the fundamental rights of labor to seek public assistance in its dispute with the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.914" offset="1007052">There was, as I read the record, no denying that the words “threaten, coerce, or restrain” would reach that conduct, and this horns were loc -- they locked horns on this question and it became one of the critical issues in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.184" offset="1080090">One of those problems that carried the conference that you can see from the record, right down to the last moment when it almost split up without any agreement between the House and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.554" offset="1117602">The resolution of the conflict appears over on page 4 of the statute, where the Conference Committee resorted to one of the many provisos that you will find in this Act qualifying what precedes, not the best draftsmanship in the world but the only way, apparently, the agreement could be reached at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.157" offset="1223973">Of your brief?</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="280.491" stopTime="283.167">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="280.491" offset="1225331">Very thin comparative print that I have had distributed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="283.167" stopTime="285.905">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="283.167" offset="1235989">I see, yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="285.905" stopTime="652.411">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="285.905" offset="1246960">And the proviso reads “provided that, for the purpose of this paragraph 4 only, nothing contained in such paragraph shall be construed to prohibit publicity other than picketing for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers and members of the labor organization, that a product or products are produced by an employer, with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute, and are distributed by another employer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="313.610" offset="1357824">So that, it would seem, from the face of the language at least, that it was quite plain that the compromise was that the statute would not interfere with the right to engage in publicity other than picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.296" offset="1416547">But, the effort of Senator Kennedy and the Senate conferees, to have a broader proviso that would accept picketing at the site of the secondary employer where he sold the goods of a manufacturer with whom the Union had a dispute, was excluded from the proviso and by implication and also, we say, by the necessary words included in the prohibition as an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.955" offset="1531173">And, there's no doubt that the explanations of the conference agreement, at least in general terms, were that the Senate had been unsuccessful in its position with respect to picketing but that it had succeeded in creating an exception from the words “threaten, coerce, or restrain” with respect to hand-billing and all other forms of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.575" offset="1629706">Against that background, I come to the facts of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.952" offset="1655202">They're very simple and not at all in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.763" offset="1674428">The Union, Teamsters Local 760, was in a labor dispute with Tree Fruits, an organization which represented and which we may think of as the packers of Washington State Apples around Yakima, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.172" offset="1740048">Being unable to win its -- in a -- by a strike, in an effort to put more economic pressure on Tree Fruits, the producers or packers of the apples, the Teamsters posted pickets at a number of Safeway stores in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.587" offset="1813713">The picket signs, which appear on page 5 of my brief, simply read "To Consumers Non-Union Washington State Apples are being sold at this store.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.360" offset="1856763">Please do not purchase such apples,” and then, “Teamsters Local 760.”</text>
            <text syncTime="444.649" offset="1881945">It was charged that that conduct violated this subdivision we've been talking about, Section 8 (b)(4)(II) because the picketing did threaten, coerce, or restrain Safeway where an object was to -- for Safeway to stop doing business with Tree Fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.020" offset="1991450">The Board so held, although there was no proof as to whether the picketing did any actual injury to Safeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.498" offset="2025409">The Court of Appeals for the District Columbia Circuit set aside the Board's order on the ground that there was no proof that the picketing had done substantial injury to Safeway or that it was likely to do sufficient injury to Safeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.446" offset="2085177">And, we then brought the case here, arguing that the Court of Appeals was wrong in saying that the case was incomplete without proof of -- that the da -- that the picketing would do substantial injury to Safeway or had done substantial injury to Safeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.034" offset="2163545">We submit the Court of Appeals requirement -- now, I come to the somewhat different argument made by counsel a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.707" offset="2194160">We submit the Court of Appeals requirement, that there be affirmative evidence that the picketing has caused substantial harm or is about to cause substantial harm, is wrong for, I think, six independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.990" offset="2259362">First, it seems to us that it's inconsistent with the plain meaning of the words of Section 8 (b)(4)(II).</text>
            <text syncTime="549.022" offset="2299486">To picket a retail store is certainly to threaten the owner and operator of the store with loss of patronage if he doesn't give in to the Union's wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.890" offset="2358941">The presence of the picket today indicates that it'll be there tomorrow unless you stop selling, in this case, the Washington State Apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.950" offset="2387153">If there's any doubt about that, it's removed by the communication that the Teamsters gave to the Safeway stores, saying “if we're wrong in thinking that you are selling Washington State Apples, we'll take the pickets away.”</text>
            <text syncTime="582.725" offset="2434278">It wasn't put in terms of a threat but no one could miss the message.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.849" offset="2458728">It seems to me, it was just as much of a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.158" offset="2471999">Also, no one could know what the damage might be as a man pointing a gun at a bank cashier and say “give me your money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="602.095" offset="2511705">The gun might not go off, might not be loaded, might even be an imitation gun, but those possibilities do not detract from the fact that it is a threat and so, here, the possibility that the picket line may be wholly ineffective does not detract from the fact that it is something calculated to cause economic loss and intended to put economic pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.312" offset="2616613">Equally, it seems to me that it's a restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.302" offset="2628629">It was intended not to leave the decision whether to sell the Washington State Apples to Safeway but to overbear Safeway's will to prevent it from selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.670" offset="2678053">And, surely, nobody can say that the objective was not to prevent Safeway from dealing with Tree Fruits.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.540" offset="3501537">The purpose, as I explained yesterday, was to carry the protection back farther to enable the primary employer and the secondary employer when confronted with a threat, to enable the secondary employer to get protection at that stage instead of waiting until the harm was done and to relieve the primary employer from the risk that the secondary employer, instead of waiting to see what would happen to him, to relieve him from the secondary employer simply giving in and to give the primary employer protection against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.811" offset="3658585">Now, I suggest that this becomes quite clear if you think in terms not of a consumer picket line, but of a picket line directed at the loading platforms or the employee's entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.690" offset="3710098">If it were shown that they were picketing there or that there were a threat that the Union would picket there, and it was charged that this was coercion or -- threatening, coercion, or restraining the employer, no one would suggest that it was a defense to say, “well, we can't tell whether anybody will honor the picket line or we can't tell how much damage the picket line will do, or we can't tell whether the strike or refusal to load or unload goods will really hurt the secondary employer's business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="930.246" offset="3824306">And, by the same token, that inquiry is not permissible here.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.741" offset="3846353">Third, I point out this was held in the Fifth Circuit in a case in conflict with this one, that the -- any inquiry into the amount of harm done leads into a morass.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.573" offset="3893687">How much economic loss does it take to be coercion?</text>
            <text syncTime="953.391" offset="3916988">Does it have to be 1 product, 10 products, 20 products, 1 customer, 10 customers, 20 customers?</text>
            <text syncTime="960.849" offset="3946768">It's a fruitless inquiry and one which, fairness to the Union, does not require because if they're aim isn't to induce customers not to buy these apples, if it really is just to publicize their dispute with Tree Fruits, there're plenty of other places where they can publicize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.781" offset="4026493">The only purpose of doing it here is to have economic pressure against Tree Fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.102" offset="4055751">Next, I point that the interpretation is wholly inconsistent with the settled reasoning under other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.899" offset="4090964">Section 8 (a)(1) speaks of the interference, coercion, or restraint of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.813" offset="4114578">It's always been held that when the employer engages in questioning employees about their Union membership or when he conducts surveillance of their activities, that it's irrelevant whether any employee actually felt coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.556" offset="4173615">It's the kind of conduct and the intent of the conduct or tendency of the conduct that one looks to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.362" offset="4204857">Similarly, in Section 8 (b)(1), speaking of coercion and restraint of employees, the same rule had always been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.464" offset="4241220">Under 8 (b)(4), in speaking of inducing or encouraging employees to engage in a strike, it had always been held and always has been held that it applies to picketing regardless of any showing as to what effect the picketing has actually had on the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.573" offset="4309661">And, in speaking of forcing and requiring the secondary employer to stop doing business with the primary employer, nobody has ever inquired whether it actually did so force or require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.380" offset="4356890">And, we think that Congress, here, must be taken in using a very similar phrase to have had a very similar intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.409" offset="4397014">Next, I point out that the legislative history on this point is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.448" offset="4425122">It was stated, first, in objection to the words “threaten, coerce, and restrain” before the proviso was put in, that they -- that it would cutoff the right to engage in consumer picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.158" offset="4484054">And, after the proviso was put in, which as I say was one of the critical issue, it was clearly stated on the Floor of the Senate and in the House that the Senate had lost out in its views about consumer picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.385" offset="4556884">I think, perhaps, the clearest statement is the one on page 24 of my brief which Senator Kennedy made in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.510" offset="4589380">“We were not able to persuade the House conferees to permit picketing in front of that secondary shop, but we were able to persuade them to agree that the Union shall be free to conduct informational activity short of picketing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.682" offset="4658134">For those reasons, it seemed --</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.350" offset="5028760">I think there's a constitutional problem here and I would say that it was one that had to be faced up to, that the intention of congress is so clear that this is a case where the, as Justice Cardozo said in Hopkins Savings Association against Cleary, that where the intent is distinctly revealed, the court cannot avoid the constitutional issue by disingenuous reasoning -- reading that the issue has to be faced up to an answer, and I think this is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.537" offset="5165537">Before I come to the constitutional issue, there is one more point with which I must deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.698" offset="5194167">As I understand Mr. Previant's brief, he suggest another interpretation than that of the Court of Appeals, or be it without abandoning the Court of Appeals' interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.303" offset="5244635">He says it suggest that it all depends on the wording of the picket sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.377" offset="5268877">That if the picket here had said “please don't buy from Safeway,” then he would think that we had, I'm not sure you'd agree with this but that we have a stronger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.052" offset="5311613">But he says if it says “please don't buy Washington Apples,” then that isn't within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.459" offset="5345259">Well, I suggest that it is still a threat, it is still within the purpose of the statute in terms of the protection of the secondary employer and the primary employer that it still certainly can reasonably be found to have the prohibited objective, and I think the legislative history is pretty plainly against Mr. Previant upon this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.228" offset="5452257">Most of the statements, like the one that I read from Senator Kennedy before, speak in general terms of picketing in front of that secondary shop and I would guess I would be doubtful whether anybody could fairly say that those read on this exact question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.661" offset="5533968">But, there are two, at least, positive indications that the Senators and House were thinking in terms of what might be called product picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.791" offset="5586526">In the first place, the example of the Coors Brewery that I mentioned earlier was specifically put in terms of appeals to -- was specifically put in terms of signs asking the public not to buy the product and Senator Morse, who is certainly one of the leading experts on the labor in the House, perhaps to more labor laws than any other Senator, specifically stated that one of the reasons he had refused to sign the conference report was that it prevented employees from picketing at an establishment and -- at retail establishment and asking the public not to buy the product made of a manufacturer with whom the Union had a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.189" offset="5784116">Those two instances, I think, are precise and on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.346" offset="5804805">I might also suggest that I frankly am skeptical, although my experience doesn't go far enough to state definitely, as to whether the way the s -- whether the wording of the sign makes a great deal of difference in what actually happens in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.341" offset="5868753">I would guess that, perhaps, half of the people, influenced by the fact there was picketing at the Safeway store, figured they better go to Furness entirely rather than just not buy the apples, but that's -- I enter that simply as a note of skepticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.695" offset="5938134">For that reason, we think there is no greater merit to the argument that is presented by the respondents here and that the statute will not bare a discrimination between picketing of -- in front of the store ,generally, and picketing of the particular product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.037" offset="6023502">That brings me to the final issue which, of course, the Court of Appeals didn't have to consider, and that is whether this restriction is in accordance with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.334" offset="6072717">The argument is that that this picketing in front of the retail outlet is a form of communication and that Congress does not have power, under these circumstances, to restrict it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.508" offset="6133426">I would emphasize, first, two qualities of picketing one cut strongly in our favor, the other cut strongly in favor of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.850" offset="6182745">First, I would emphasize that this is picketing in front of a neutral employer who has no interest in the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.479" offset="6229243">It's 100 or more miles away from the dispute and there is nothing he has done, except sell his wares and continue to buy and sell his wares, that in any way that prejudices the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.959" offset="6291205">That seems to me to cut most strongly in our favor, secondary picketing has always been treated as somewhat different from picketing at the scene of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.209" offset="6328195">The second fact that I think everybody should have firmly in mind is that this was picketing not to employees or to truck drivers or to a group -- particularly to a group of Union members in their capacity as workers but was addressed to a general public in Seattle, to a general public, a very large percentage of whom are -- well, not a large percentage, a very large number of whom are members of the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.580" offset="6449716">It's a very strong Teamsters town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.835" offset="6462673">That cuts, I think, in Mr. Previant's way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.368" offset="6476884">Now, we say, first, that this issue is settled in favor of the constitutionality of the statute by this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.431" offset="6517112">In the Vault case, the Court laid down the formula that a legislature, the same rule which earlier applied to congress, has the power to formulate a policy with respect to this economic contest and then to forbid picketing, the purpose of which is contrary to that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.360" offset="6612825">Here, the policy was to protect secondary employers against injury in a dispute to which they were not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.314" offset="6648665">It was to prevent -- protect primary employers against what many people felt was the unfair weapon of conscripting neutrals who would find it easier to stop dealing with them and keep out of labor trouble than it would be to continue dealing with the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.626" offset="6725883">The picketing, also addressed to consumers, has an objective inconsistent with that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.294" offset="6756498">And, under the reasoning of the Vault case and the others that follow it, this would, therefore, seem to be constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.837" offset="9694751">And, as I understand the facts of the Servette case to follow, it's agreed that that was handbilling and there is no argument that it was picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.947" offset="9731114">So, I think, Your Honor's case is one that the Board would have to rule out in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.295" offset="9752534">I've given the best answer I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.927" offset="9759117">I think if he has a picket sign, even if he stands pretty still, he's probably picketing but that's just a quick call for tough judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2483.397" offset="10036955">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.460" offset="10053256">I think this last colloquy does emphasize something that confronts the Court in all of these cases because whether there's a stipulation that there's picketing or not, there are different kinds of picketing and different ways of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.856" offset="10118771">Our client suggested last night after hearing Justice Stewart's question that if he had mo -- marched in front of this store merely with handbills but held the handbill in front of him and then, as the people went by, handed them a handbill as much as you see newspaper purveyors on the street corners or they had their newspaper up in front of them with the big headline there that he said “well, what I -- what would I be doing then?</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.653" offset="10218036">Would I be picketing or handbilling?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.002" offset="10227336">I think it's a good question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.812" offset="10234650">I don't know that it has to be met in this case, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.950" offset="10247189">I do think that the nature of the problem in the case requires, however, a little more of attention to the facts than the General gave us this morning because if there is a difference in types of picketing or in picketing as such, then it seems to us that in each case there is a burden on the Board in the first instance to determine whether or not the particular means which a Union employs in order to bring its particular cause to triumph is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.136" offset="10415940">And, that you cannot do, as the Board did here and as believe the Solicitor General asked this Court to do, assume from the mere fact of picketing a per se threat or coercion which the Congress intended to ban by this statute without saying so specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.778" offset="10502457">The facts in this case show that, after the strike which involves some-1,500 employees and which unfortunately was a short duration because of the willingness of these strike-breakers and others to return to work, the Union thought that the economic pressure which it could assert against Tree Fruits could best be accomplished by asking the consumers not to buy the apples which Tree Fruits packed, warehoused, and shipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.146" offset="10651982">And, in accordance with that determination, they then went to the large chain of supermarkets in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.724" offset="10694301">They advised the managers of those stores what their problem was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.475" offset="10713318">They gave them a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.281" offset="10720528">They told them the history of their dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.805" offset="10730559">They told them how they'd been willing to submit to mediation or arbitration and how the employer turned it down and that, finally, this strike occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.467" offset="10765249">That in spite of the strike, the 21 employers who are part of the Tree Fruits Association were, nevertheless, engaged in what was almost normal operation that is packing, warehousing, shipping, the Washington State Apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.295" offset="10824600">They advised this manager that they were going to ask the public not to buy the apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.464" offset="10857200">They told him that they had given specific instructions to the pickets in that regard and they handed him the instructions to the pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.245" offset="10900355">They were instructed to patrol peacefully at the consumer entrance of the stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.896" offset="10927000">They were to stay away from the delivery entrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.823" offset="10942673">They were not to interfere with any of the employees in the stores, the clerks or others, nor were they to interfere with any drivers or any other persons who entered upon the store premises, either for the purpose of making pickups or for the purpose of making deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.917" offset="11007039">And, they were going to circulate a handbill which they, in turn, gave a copy to the manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.121" offset="11035878">They even suggested to the manager that there should be no doubt about their intention that all of this be posted on the bulletin board so that the employees in that store know that there was no pressure intended or asserted against Safeway or its employees or even at its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.566" offset="11113618">Mr. Justice Goldberg has pointed to the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.299" offset="11128560">These two middle-aged, probably middle-classed, ladies carrying their little aprons, walking in front of that store, merely saying “non-Union Washington State Apples are being sold at this store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.174" offset="11196061">Please do not purchase such apples.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.465" offset="11205256">And, the picture will show that the “please do not purchase such apples” is not a footnote but is as large almost as the word "non-Union Washington State Apples."</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.529" offset="11253530">The handbills did the same thing, and they emphasized that this is not a strike against any store or market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.971" offset="11295222">This picketing started after the store opened for business so there'll be no interference with deliveries or with employees and it was concluded before the store closed its business that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.416" offset="11345063">There were generally only two pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.305" offset="11352586">On one occasion, there were three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.684" offset="11362095">There's no dispute that this was entirely peaceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.439" offset="11373171">There was no blocking in any egrets or anywhere as to the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.403" offset="11388949">The handbills were passed out to only those who would accept them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.970" offset="11399293">They did not confront customers or forced these handbills on the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.776" offset="11418520">The store employees worked as usual, the deliveries and pickups continued as usual and, even in those instances where the store was at the rear of a parking lot, they had to picket out in front of the parking lot where they couldn't distribute the handbills which is one example of why distributing handbills is not always as effective as picketing because, here, the people are driving into the parking lot and they could not even -- if there were a distribution of handbills, they could not have been given those handbills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.740" offset="11542340">These, then, are the facts which the Board would have a say, leads to the per se conclusion, a priori assumption that this is picketing which threatens, coerces, and restrains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.757" offset="11594376">That this is picketing which the Congress had in mind when it was talking about secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.566" offset="11665638">Now, the court below, we believe, did what was proper under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.527" offset="11701478">It said that the only plausible reading of the statute was that the determination to be made by the Board was whether or not picketing in fact threatens, coerces, or restrains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.483" offset="11765321">That you cannot assume from the mere act of picketing, it constitutes a threat any more than a newspaper ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.457" offset="11801161">That it constitutes coercion any more than any other form of persuasion or that it constitutes a restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.746" offset="11834389">And, the court did not say that because there was no damage, there was no threat, coercion, or restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.739" offset="11866363">The court mentioned that part of the case in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.584" offset="11893739">It said, as to the question of whether there is a threat, coercion, or restraint, we consider the impact of this conduct along with all other elements in the case, which is what the Board should have done according to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.561" offset="11957582">We considered with -- along the fact that there was no work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.042" offset="11971584">There was no delivery stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.392" offset="11976913">There was no confrontation of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.573" offset="11985690">There was no embargo of that store and no evidence indicating in anyway that this picket, only asking the consumer not to buy Washington State Apples, turned away any other customer as a result of that sign who intended to enter that store for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.957" offset="12067192">That, in it of itself, would not be conclusive but the court enumerated all of these things, including the element of damage and said “as we look at this total picture, we can find no basis for a conclusion that this picketing constituted a threat or that it was coercion or that it restrained as contemplated by the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.610" offset="12181817">It was a -- it was a rejection of the Board's conclusion because the Board could not find that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.519" offset="12201462">It was, in that sense, a finding of fact, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4116.282" offset="16568508">He said that, first of all, he defined a secondary boycott as involving the application of pressure, usually economic pressure, on one company for the purpose of forcing it to stop doing business with another.He says there are two kinds.</text>

            <text syncTime="4238.814" offset="17058670">Incidentally, getting back, I re -- now to this question of a threat, I note that the Board does not, even as late as November 21, 1963, predicate its decisions in this area on the word “threat” in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.143" offset="17175907">In the case of Dairylea Dairy Distributors, 145 NLRB No. 14, 54 LRRM 1326, the Board says “with respect to respondent's reliance upon the Court's decision in Fruit and Vegetable Packers and Warehousemen, Local 760, the petition for certiorari granted, we note that the Board is respectfully adhering to its position that consumer picketing of a secondary establishment constitutes restraint and coercion, not threat.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.275" offset="17336508">I think the Board accepts the fact that it is a different kind of threat, not the dictionary term that was used in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.743" offset="17370363">And, we point out in our brief, as do the briefs of amicus in this case, that this Court, in another case involving similar language but used another section of the statute, the statute says you shall not coerce or restrain employees in the exercise of their right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.334" offset="17460746">This Court said that this is to be used only in a particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.366" offset="17488854">It's a restrictive phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.563" offset="17497631">It is to be equated with threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.542" offset="17529501">Now, admittedly, what may not be coercive as to an employee maybe coercive as to an employer, but we submit that when the legislature uses -- the Congress uses precisely the same language which appeared in another part of the Act, and which now has on it the gloss of the interpretation of this Court in the Local 639 case, that they must be deemed to have adopted that interpretation and that, there and here as in there, Court said there in the 639 case, Curtis Furniture, that coerce and restrain means violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.256" offset="17712358">It means the usual overbearing kind of conduct, not whatever to arrest some person may find in his mind because of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.796" offset="17754572">The Court refused to use that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.041" offset="17763558">The Court refused to say that there was a subjective test when that precise phrase was used in a -- in the preceding section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.888" offset="17798875">We say that we want to assume that the Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.937" offset="17807130">Now, why do we quarrel with the interpretation here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.647" offset="17829909">We think we have a strong constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.255" offset="17844433">We may have a very strong constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.268" offset="17856449">But we say that we have an obligation and we believe the Court has an obligation to look at a statute and, if upon reading that statute, it appears that any one of two constructions of that statute are perfectly reasonable, then it should adopt that construction which avoids the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.782" offset="17966477">Solicitor General feels that this rule does not apply because he says it's so clear here what the Congress intended that this Court would, although he doesn't say so but I think the thrust of the argument is such, would in fact be legislating if, they said the Congress didn't do so, merely to avoid the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.156" offset="18044008">But, we invite the examination of the statutory language of the legislative materials of the prior cases of this Court and we say that a perfectly rational interpretation of the statute, a perfectly plausible interpretation, more than plausible is a bad word, a real sound interpretation of this statute will avoid the constitutional question by the s -- just the holding, as the court below did.</text>
