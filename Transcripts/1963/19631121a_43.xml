            <text syncTime="27.888" offset="214915">My name is Fuston sir, it's a common mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.825" offset="230693">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.575" offset="249710">This is a labor case involved in preemption that arose in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.405" offset="280952">It's a case where peaceful picketing was enjoined by a state court and the Court held that there was no labor dispute and no interstate commerce involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.945" offset="355140">The separate injunction was made permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.655" offset="369977">The case was duly appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eastern Section of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.002" offset="395368">The case, after have been for some time, it was affirmed in the opinion of the Court of Appeals was fortified but then holding that the construction project was completed and the case was moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.928" offset="443120">We get to the certiorari case to the Supreme Court of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.056" offset="459630">The certiorari was denied and within certiorari, the case to this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.995" offset="487320">May it please the Court, the facts that precipitated this had been occurred as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.987" offset="519293">The Chattanooga Building Trades is composed of all the craft unions and it is interested all craft unions are in getting all the work possible for its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.767" offset="570389">They knew back in 1960, that Jafco, was going to build a huge shopping center in the City of Cleveland, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.566" offset="609677">It would cover several -- equivalent of several city blocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.536" offset="625560">It would have many tenants including a bank, bowling alley, chain stores and whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.583" offset="653667">The unions carefully awaited to see who the prime contractor would be and finally, it was announced that the Rea Construction Company would be the prime contractor and they learned that the Rea Construction Company was from Charlotte, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.343" offset="720750">As in all this type of cases and in this particular case, the Chattanooga Building Trades then called the Charlotte Building Trades, trying to find out something about this contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.076" offset="775711">Usually, they get an answer that a contractor is what they call a fair contractor or employs union man or he employs non-union man or a combination of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.111" offset="819806">And they were informed on this particular occasion, that the Jones family had two corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.655" offset="846033">One was called the A.J. Jones Construction Company which was union.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.183" offset="868080">They also had a sister corporation called the Rea Construction Company which was strictly nonunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.592" offset="897755">And in this particular case, they learned that it would be the nonunion corporation that had gotten this particular job and soon after work started, the Chattanooga Building Trades considered putting a picket on the job to every task, the fact that it was nonunion to advertise about their working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.066" offset="999633">But before they did, a business agent for the Hod-Carriers Union with by the construction site and talked to some of the laborers working there.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.880" offset="1046862">They were in the rough stages at that time, bulldozing and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.568" offset="1065671">The laborers said, "Mr. Elkins, we're only getting a dollar in a half an hour on this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.307" offset="1096600">Can't you please do something for us?"</text>
            <text syncTime="251.399" offset="1108929">And he said, "Well, I will see what can be done."</text>
            <text syncTime="253.965" offset="1119274">He then went to the Chattanooga Building Trades, he learned that they had already considered placing a picket on the job and the next day, one picket arrived and again, patrolling the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.238" offset="1172355">But in just a few minutes, after the picketing had begun, the picketing was stopped by an ex parte injunction issued by a State Chancery Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.962" offset="1227212">We duly file a motion to have the case dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.649" offset="1246020">One of the defenses was the doctrine of preemption based upon this Court's decision of San Diego versus Garmon and other relevant cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.857" offset="1290846">At the show course here and the judge that had issued an injunction, had another judge to set for him here and this judge refused to resolve the injunction until it final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.308" offset="1340583">We had the final hearing and the judge at that time had a lengthy opinion, held that there was no labor dispute by any stretch of imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.915" offset="1398993">He held that interstate commerce was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.705" offset="1414144">He cited absolutely a no authorities, no decisions, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.369" offset="1432848">The only decision that is decided -- that is cited in his entire opinion is a case involving intrastate commerce that is not even relevant to the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.988" offset="1487287">The very next day, we had this case on the road to the Court of Appeals and we filed a motion in that court to move the case up because we were afraid that the construction project would be completed and we would not have an opportunity to have our case determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.602" offset="1581746">The Court of Appeals listened to us and then announced that they would not move the case up on the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.193" offset="1612152">Later, the case came home for hearing in its regular term and we ordered the case at which then the court wanted to know when the construction project would be over.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.951" offset="1651127">And both counsel for the defendants and counsel for myself and asked to the court that duty in here, the lace whether one thing or another, it'd be a several weeks before the work would be over.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.312" offset="1700655">The Court of Appeals then held the case from September until the following January and then adopted the trial court's decision verbatim and also added that the case was moot because the project had just been completed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.955" offset="1779231">And, we say if the Court please, that the case is not moot that there was a labor dispute and that interstate commerce was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.353" offset="1832835">First of all, we think that the -- this Court's decision in the case of -- of Marine Engineers versus the Interlake Steamship Company is controlling as to these terms, as true that the -- this Court's opinion was not available at that time, I think it was two or three months after this decision was written when this Court acted in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.422" offset="1945057">But I used the precise language as identical in all my pleadings and it was the argument that I had made to each court and that is that the definitions of the terms under National Labor Relations Act should be left to the tribunal that Congress has chosen to administer the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.951" offset="2035127">And this Court held that in the Interlake case as I understand it, that the -- that the words or labor organizations defined by the Act and the state courts have no right to interpret that.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.304" offset="2080580">It should go to the N.L.R.B. Since that time and since that -- since I've written my brief, there's been another case by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.216" offset="2120286">It's a Local 1207, Bridge Workers versus Perko, decided this summer and the opinioned by his Honor, Mr. Justice Harlan and it follows the Interlake case and says that, "An employee which defined by the Act, should be left to the National Labor Relations Board when a case of reasonable argument is made to that effect."</text>
            <text syncTime="529.897" offset="2223000">That seems highly illogical to us that you should say that certain words that are defined in the Act should be left to the tribunal that has been chosen to administer the Act and that in this case, to say that other definitions appear in the Act should not be left to the same tribunal, and that would be labor dispute which is defined by the Act and it would also be commerce as defined by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.767" offset="2346402">In this particular case, the complaint was that we were picketing to cause a breach of contracts between these Jafco Corporation and Rea Construction Company or the Rea Construction Company and -- and with other companies has been one of the -- that business has been raised time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.813" offset="2462595">And in fact that we had a great deal -- great deal of difficulty with that argument until the so-called Landrum-Griffin amendments to the Taft-Hartley laws were paced in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.661" offset="2514004">The Court, I'm sure, will recall that Section 8 (b) (4) (1), was left the same but a new Section was added which is 8 (b) (4) (ii).</text>
            <text syncTime="615.464" offset="2565204">And the (ii) Section says that it's an unfair labor practice in so many words, if you attempt to cause a cessation of business between one person and another is very much more broad than just causing a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.752" offset="2630405">You can have a situation where two people just deal with each other without a written contract and it could be unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.292" offset="2656528">And we say that, even if we take the statements that they say are true in their bill or complaint, that it is a matter they discovered by the unfair labor practice Section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.712" offset="2718177">Of course, we contend that it's protected activity under Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.132" offset="2743881">And we say if the Court please, that the Interlake case and the Perko cases are authority for the proposition that this issue should be left to the N.L.R.B.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.089" offset="2795708">We went ahead and actually proved the time of trial -- time came around that Rea Construction Company was involved in interstate commerce and just on this one project alone, that it purchased materials from outside State, mine to at least three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.786" offset="2870523">The jurisdiction or requirements set by the -- by the N.L.R.B. and which was frozen by the Landrum-Griffin Acts of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.271" offset="2908453">But the court just ignored it and referred to those facts and referred to no decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.782" offset="2934471">We beg if the Court please that the big question that we have here today is this question of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.067" offset="2971669">It's a question that hovers over every one of these cases where you have a construction project because at sometime, you don't know exactly when a construction project is going to be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.268" offset="3036453">If the state court takes juris -- jurisdiction which we say is illegal and arbitrary, we -- there is nothing, we're powerless to do anything and we can't do anything except take it up to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.337" offset="3100714">And you usually get best so far as your Court of Appeals in your State, when the project is completed, if you get that fat at all, and that court acts and thereafter, you can't go to your State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.735" offset="3162363">It's -- they say, “Well, the construction project is over the question is moot, we will not hear you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="770.167" offset="3183992">Now, we say that the question is not moot for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.626" offset="3205831">In the very first case that arose under the Act, my law partner Mr. King who was here yesterday and introduced me held before the Board, that case by different rounds went to the Supreme Court of Tennessee where we got a ruling which I have cited in my brief under Watson Versus Wilson, it also went the Board route through the Sixth Circuit to this Honorable Court, for we had decision or other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.631" offset="3333935">But the facts in that case were briefly this.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.568" offset="3349608">They had a speculative contractor in Chattanooga who was building houses and the unions, the Chattanooga Building Trades and especially the carpenters decided to put a picket on one of these construction projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.071" offset="3411675">And on the day before the 1947 Act went into effect, picketing stopped and the next day, the prime contractor went to the Board wanting a cease-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.603" offset="3485759">And based upon those facts, this Court held in the first case that it could have acted on a state of facts similar to what we have here today, that the underlying dispute had not been resolved and therefore, the Board was entitled to the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.724" offset="3570291">Now here, we come here several years later and the -- she was on the under court.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.215" offset="3596204">We think that at this time since the matter is arguably before the Board in the first place and since the underlying dispute has never been resolved, that for that reason, the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.223" offset="3680214">Another case that somewhat similar to it was a case that we did not have at the time that we order a brief which was decided this summer by this Court is the case of -- Division 1287 Street Electric and Motor Coach Employees versus Missouri and the case was written -- the opinion is written by his Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.846" offset="3790764">And in that case as we read it, there was an Act by the Governor of Missouri and they had action in the state court and this -- in the state -- the court states that the very threshold meant with the -- with the question of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.363" offset="3860773">And because where time that the case got to this Honorable Court, the Governor had removed his authority and taken over the -- the business of public utility in -- in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.148" offset="3923989">And in the opinion of this Court again stated no less than three months ago, that the case was not moot because the underlying dispute had not been resolved between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.166" offset="3972054">And we say for that reason that the case was not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.015" offset="3991385">For our second reason, we say this, --</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.589" offset="6285772">That clearly, a higher court has the right to review any question and give her advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.111" offset="6331852">Now, if the Court of Appeals for the Eastern Section had said the case is moot, we refuse to consider it any further, that would have been one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.527" offset="6385455">But the Court of Appeals said the case is moot but in spite of it being moot, we hold that this picketing was illegal and they made some more statements about it and then they stated that they adopted the decision of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.420" offset="6453060">Now, if the Court of Appeals has a right to give an advisory opinion and certainly, it seems to us that a higher court has the privilege to redo that advisory opinion as to ascertain whether or not they gave the correct advisory opinion and we say for that reason, if the Court please, that the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.805" offset="6558595">In short, the Court please, we feel that this as a case as very similar to all these picketing cases that we have involved in construction projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.344" offset="6600704">We have this -- this question of mootness always hovering over and because we can't get them up fast enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.923" offset="6631111">For example, in about three weeks I think that you'll have the -- keep your birthday of Garner versus Teamsters as I recall, it was about the middle of December 1953 when this Court rendered the opinion on rather famous case now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.658" offset="6697984">I know I was in Charlotte, North Carolina on that occasion or in the -- the same kind of case before the Superior Court in Charlotte, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.464" offset="6733197">And if you will look on the date that the -- that the Garner versus Teamsters case came out, you'll find that it made the headlines in the Charlotte Observer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.104" offset="6779800">And I was eating my lunch and I had the case argued about this time of the day and I was arguing the case of preemption to the -- to the Superior Court there where they were building the airport and argued it with the newspaper in my hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.921" offset="6839045">The opinion I got from the Charlotte paper was very short but I was familiar with the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and it stated in the article that -- that that court had been affirmed and I was arguing that was the -- that was, I had that case and -- a case of Oliver versus (Inaudible) of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.598" offset="6921801">I think that Tennessee Supreme Court actually was the first state court from my research that written as a doctrine of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.822" offset="6954611">And with those two cases and with the newspaper clipping that I had, I was arguing preemption to that court down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.879" offset="6986898">As soon as I got to of to the argument, I felt pretty good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.217" offset="6996198">I wanted to stand up and get the decision of this Court, have it flown back in for the -- for the trial judge the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.093" offset="7023783">And if you'll read the next issue of the Charlotte Observer, you will see that this judge granted the injunction with the remarks, "Mr. Fuston, I going to grant the injunction in this case and you can take me to the Supreme Court and reverse me."</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.767" offset="7094418">But in the meantime, our airport will be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.324" offset="7108629">And he was absolutely right because at all of these cases, you have this question of whether or not you can get a case up to a higher court before the project is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.937" offset="7163068">Now, we say if the Court please, that on a basis of the decision of this Court since the Garner case that this is a case in which the opinion of the Court of Appeals of the Eastern Section of Tennessee should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.711" offset="7222209">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.737" offset="7246346">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.435" offset="7253138">Before I begin to talk, I would like to say something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.090" offset="7271737">This is indeed a small world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.174" offset="7284067">This is the first time I've had occasion to come before this Court and one of the cases this morning came from the Court of Claims on which my Uncle Sam Whittaker has become a fixture and it was very interesting and difficult case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.054" offset="7343626">The other one came from Louisiana where my wife was born, where I visit frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.922" offset="7371107">And I couldn't but think as I listen to that case on the fact that although I'm not a Chinese, I have a Chinese godson in Hong Kong and should he wish to run from office in Louisiana, I would hate to think that he would have to designate himself as a Mongoloid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.699" offset="7450206">Now, with those remarks back, I mean, I will turn to discussion of the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.551" offset="7473612">The most delicious part of having a case before this Court is that as my friend and hero, Mr. Justice Vanderbilt once said, "This Court is of necessity more interested in what the law ought to be than in what the law is, not own any purely ad hoc basis but on the basis of our scheme of ordered liberty."</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.240" offset="7600358">Now, law is of course a substitute for warfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.191" offset="7616136">It is the modern equivalent of war, we hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.732" offset="7630346">And you are of course interested in the rights of people and we remember it all the times that one's rights end where one's wrongs begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.213" offset="7684263">This Court has very difficult cases to hear and to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.451" offset="7701191">In this matter of peaceful picketing for example, it was first held by this Court that peaceful picketing was tantamount to free speech and then it was later recognized that that was not true, that peaceful picketing is more than free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.488" offset="7769318">Now, the case we have here today does not involve a claim of the right of picketing on the ground of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.500" offset="7801396">It involves rather only the issue of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.930" offset="7815084">That is the only thing involved here and it's based upon such cases as the San Diego Building Trades Council case, the Engineers Association case and the current case from Atlanta which is very close to kin to the case at bar, but is quite distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.000" offset="7895333">All of these cases held, that a situation that is arguably one for the National Labor Relations Board must be handled by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.630" offset="7957922">Now, it's true that the Engineers Association case went a bit further than that, by saying that it must be reasonably arguable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.370" offset="7996897">Now in this case, we think that it is not reasonably arguable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.110" offset="8023855">One of the facts in this case, Jafco wished to build a $2 million shopping center in Cleveland, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.470" offset="8069204">They made a contract with Rea Construction Company of North Carolina to do the job and this is a company that operates on an open shop basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.664" offset="8114030">It is not nonunion, it is not union, it is on open shop basis, this appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.263" offset="8144436">Rea Construction Company in turn, contracted with the (Inaudible) to do the grading on the job and they went out there with this heavy earth moving equipment to do the grading on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.110" offset="8191770">A picket was placed, one single peaceful picket, bearing a sign in which it is stated, on which it was stated, "Rea Construction Company not under contract with Chattanooga Building Trades Council, Rea Construction Company not under contract with Chattanooga Building Trades Council.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.887" offset="8286960">Now, that picket was not removed in a manner of minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.760" offset="8302425">As a matter of fact, after the picket got there, my associate counsel in Cleveland called me, came down to Chattanooga and as I recall it, it was not until a day later that we were able to get the bills on and go the Chancellor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.257" offset="8364387">We went to the Chancellor because we felt on the basis of what we could see with our eyes and incidentally after that picket was placed immediately, all of these union heavy equipment people walked off the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.937" offset="8427081">The Lewis Brothers people left because they were afraid not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.286" offset="8444531">They were afraid of reprisal and the whole job was shutdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.937" offset="8459160">The job had a deadline, it had a time limit and the whole thing was shutdown completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.065" offset="8487581">We filed this bill in Chancery and in Tennessee, we still have separate Courts of Chancery and law and we sought an injunction because we say that the picketing was seeking a breach of a contract that existed between other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.197" offset="8564172">And there, you see statute in Tennessee that provides that that is unlawful and provides treble damages therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.185" offset="8592071">We also said that this picketing sought to effect a violation of the Tennessee right-to-work law, such as was insisted in the Curry case, because in Tennessee it is illegal to distinguish between union and nonunion employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.655" offset="8654033">We also ask damages for what we regarded as the illegal picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.097" offset="8679737">And in the course of our bill, we charged in paragraph 7 that there was no labor dispute in existence between the plaintiffs and the defendants</text>

            <text syncTime="2196.242" offset="8888299">Now, the answer in this case, the answer in this case did not -- did not reply at all to this question of whether there was a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.889" offset="8942947">In our Chancery procedure down there, we state our points paragraph-by-paragraph and they're answered paragraph-by-paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.358" offset="8980773">In the answer in this case, they completely ignored the charge that there was no labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.972" offset="8999267">They just did not answer that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.328" offset="9008671">They did deny in their answer that they were seeking to affect a breach of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.433" offset="9037093">They said, “We're not interested in affecting a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.294" offset="9052557">They did deny that they were seeking to have union people hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.827" offset="9074709">They said, “We're not seeking to have union people hired there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.610" offset="9093831">They asserted and this is on page 14 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.219" offset="9120266">They asserted this, "These defendants which show to the court that the purpose of the picketing is to inform members of organized labor in Cleveland and vicinity, sympathizers of the labor movement and the public in general, that the complainant's project is not under contract with appropriate bargaining labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.442" offset="9221099">The effect that is sought is that persons who hire contractors hereafter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.453" offset="9245236">I remind -- I remind you, this is their sworn answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.617" offset="9257880">This is all they were seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.394" offset="9264985">The effect that is sought is that persons who hire contractors, hereafter, will know which are union contractors and which are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.934" offset="9303124">If those people desire to hire such contractors as complainants, they're so informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.047" offset="9327574">Now, that was their answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.336" offset="9344711">We then took the discovery deposition of the leader of the defendant group because we wanted to pin down just what the purpose of this picketing was and so we took the discovery deposition of one C Earl Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.804" offset="9402598">He is the same person who had sworn to this answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.693" offset="9422137">And the reason we wanted to pin him down was this, my opponent -- and I have been going around and around in this field for some years, we're a little bit like Tony Canzoneri and Barney Ross use to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.455" offset="9481174">And he adverted to the Watson case which was my case and to the Carpenters case which came up here and that was my case and we had another case down there a few years ago, in which again at Cleveland, Tennessee, a picket was placed which forced the breach of a contract between a nonunion contractor whom I represented and the people who're having the job done, and the job was taken from my man and was given to a union contractor and my man then brought suit and we tried the case, and my man collected treble damages for they're having done this to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.717" offset="9646268">And they were very anxious to avoid getting themselves in the position of again being liable for treble damages, and so they made it very play in their answer and then their sworn testimony, that they were not seeking a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.501" offset="9709380">In fact they said, “We're not seeking anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.283" offset="9720456">We don't want anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.920" offset="9727039">We have no dispute with these people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.406" offset="9736965">And that is the literal language of the chief defendant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.223" offset="9752221">We have no dispute with these people, we don't want anything, we don't want a contract, we don't want to bargain with them about wages, hours, and working conditions, we don't want anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.925" offset="9795062">Now, when I took his deposition on page 54 and 58, 59 and 60 of the record, I asked him this, I said, “Did you have any interest in whether Jafco had a contract use union labor our interest was that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.948" offset="9875205">“Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.488" offset="9877295">Question - “Did you do anything about it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.443" offset="9885132">“No sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.025" offset="9895476">“Did you take any action at all with reference to Jafco and his job up here that was being done?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.237" offset="9916270">Answer - “I don't know what you mean find the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.164" offset="9924002">Do you mean that I came and talked to Jafco?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.687" offset="9934137">Question - “Did you come or anyone else from the labor organization come that you know of?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.547" offset="9953573">Answer - “I don't know, I didn't come and talk to any body.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.019" offset="9967470">Question - “Do you know of anyone else who did?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.710" offset="9978232">Answer - “I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.545" offset="9981576">No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.514" offset="9989413">Then again, he -- he said that he was unhappy because they were paying a certain rate and I said to him, “Did you say on your picket sign or did you do anything about advertising the rates they were paying?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.056" offset="10051584">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.756" offset="10054405">I said, “Your only sign there now was that they're not under contract, you said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.657" offset="10074049">And that they were interested in -- if advertising to people that we hooked on future contracts, similar jobs that it would have an effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.398" offset="10112920">Now, he -- he, therefore, skirting around the question of seeking anything which of course was involved in the Curry case directly, I mean, they were seeking something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.451" offset="10161194">They frankly admitted that they have a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.965" offset="10171225">The union had gone to see the employer and they -- they have a labor dispute there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.555" offset="10193586">But in this instance, there wasn't any that -- of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.753" offset="10206333">Now, after this discovery deposition was taken and before the trial, opposing counsel, on behalf the union, wrote to the National Labor Relations Board and asked if they would take jurisdiction of the case like that, and the Board replied that they didn't know whether they would allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.180" offset="10280103">Now on the basis of all of this, our Tennessee courts then proceeded to hold that first, there was no labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.797" offset="10318555">Second, that the picketing was an unwarranted interference since the picketing people sought no gain from the thing at all, as far as these people were concerned, that it was unwarranted interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.734" offset="10370278">And then the Court of Appeals also held that the case had become moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.846" offset="10526804">Your Honor please, the Court of Appeals and its opinion went beyond there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.049" offset="10563584">This is on page 98 and it says this, "Defendants say that when they placed this picket on the line, it was merely to education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.651" offset="10613948">We cannot accept that explanation which does not explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.385" offset="10632861">They knew that when this picket was placed at this entrance to the work that it would result in union employees refusing to cross the line and this is exactly what happen thus causing a complete work stoppage."</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.406" offset="10672985">In short, we find that the action of the defendants was frightful and malicious and in an attempt to injure both Jafco Incorporated and Rea Construction Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="2659.773" offset="10742471">Your Honor please, they do not specifically say that we could collect damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2685.175" offset="10844035">Now, I would like to distinguish just very briefly, this -- this Curry opinion which Mr. Justice White handed down last January.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.305" offset="10888547">In that case, the unions involved visited the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.654" offset="10905997">In other words, they went to see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.313" offset="10912580">They talked to them about the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.164" offset="10924074">According to the respondents, the union urged the hiring of union personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.999" offset="10947375">Now, according to the union that was not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.204" offset="10956152">They say that they requested them to raise the pay scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.374" offset="10972871">But in any event, there was a communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.675" offset="10994082">There was a demand any refusal so to speak and there was a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.135" offset="11019891">Now then, the lower court of course denied an injunction on the ground of preemption as it turned down ultimately properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.138" offset="11055940">The Georgia Supreme Court reversed and then this Court held that there was an arguable case there of jurisdiction for the National Labor Relations Board, a reasonably arguable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.163" offset="11116022">Now, what is a labor dispute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.346" offset="11128769">In our brief which is extremely brief, on page 2, I quote the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.910" offset="11175058">And this is what the Act says is a labor dispute and we say it does not fit the situation, "Any controversy concerning terms, tenure or conditions of employment or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether the dispute in stand in approximate relationship of employer and employee."</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.878" offset="11302849">Now, we say that, that just doesn't fit here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.893" offset="11314970">They were not interested, there was no controversy, you don't controvert with someone that you have no contact with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.474" offset="11337226">You make no demands upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.286" offset="11344541">There's no controversy there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.404" offset="11353004">And we say that there is no labor dispute there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.276" offset="11368469">Now, had they chosen to stand, may it please the Court, on what their picket sign said, Rea Construction Company, not under contract with Chattanooga Building Trades Council?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.235" offset="11420296">Then, it would have been a picketing for representation for a union contract and that obviously, would have made an arguable case from the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.693" offset="11466167">But did they do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.814" offset="11470660">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.675" offset="11474108">They refuted that in their sworn answer and in their sworn testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.548" offset="11489573">They said that's not really what we mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.298" offset="11496573">That's not what we're after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.922" offset="11503052">We're not interested in representing, we're not interested in discussing wages, hours or working conditions or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.986" offset="11539310">And so, they swore in their answer and in their testimony that they did not seek any of these things and we say when they get back, that they cut themselves off from this business of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.782" offset="11586539">It seems to us that it is not fair or legally sound for them to say, we seek nothing from this employer and we have no desire to hurt him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.580" offset="11633664">Therefore, he can't sue us in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.906" offset="11647039">And yet, because we may really be some -- seeking something from him and we may really be seeking to damage him after all, this is a matter for the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.092" offset="11699702">They are in effect seeking to get themselves into a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.382" offset="11716942">But the trouble is in their testimony, they blow hot and cold and the law doesn't like a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.545" offset="11741602">And when you blow away, you do away with the vacuum anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.506" offset="11757380">There is no vacuum left because there's atmosphere there and there's a great deal of atmosphere in this case.</text>
