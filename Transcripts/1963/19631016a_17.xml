            <text syncTime="27.133" offset="211884">These cases are here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the State of Kentucky to review a judgment and an order of that Court which judgment and order set aside a seniority determination made under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.437" offset="309164">In case 17, the petitioners are a group of employees who are adversely affected by the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.695" offset="346154">They are represented here by Mr. Ratner whose argument will follow mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.983" offset="363290">Case Number 18 is the petition of the Local Union itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.754" offset="386382">And I will -- to set the issue clearly before the Court attempt to expound the facts upon which the decision below was based or should have been based upon which was we think is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.944" offset="447195">The basic question presented of course is whether or not a state court or a federal court may set aside an interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement rendered by a Committee authorized to make such interpretation under the agreement because the Court is of the opinion that interpretation was erroneous or contrary to natural justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.010" offset="543431">There are five parties actually or groups of parties involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.059" offset="571643">The petitioner in Number 18, as I stated is a labor union, Local 89 representing many employees in the Louisville, Kentucky area.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.613" offset="617827">The Dealers Transport Company which was a party below, in the Tennessee Corporation which delivers automobiles and trucks and interstate commerce and it has a terminal in Louisville, Kentucky where the fourth company has an assembly plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="691284">The E &amp; L Transport Company similarly is a trucking company and interstate commerce delivering automobiles and trucks out of the four assembly plant in Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.374" offset="732871">This company was not a respondent below.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.992" offset="747290">The respondents Moore as a class are a group of employees of Dealers Transport Company employed by Dealers Transport Company in its operation of trucking away automobiles and trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.433" offset="809148">And this group is a mem -- are -- all of members of this group are members of Local 89.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.997" offset="839346">The petitioners Humphrey are a class of employees of E &amp; L Transport Company, the competitor to Dealers and are similarly members of Local 89 and represented by Local 89 for the purposes of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.981" offset="903293">Dealers and E &amp; L, the trucking employers in this case are members of a multi-employer, multi-union bargaining unit and have been for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.700" offset="966196">These employers give their power of attorney to an employer's group known as Automobile Transporters Labor Division.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.415" offset="1761050">In fact there is one very sharp difference insofar as the grievance procedure is concerned but it is patterned very closely after it.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.179" offset="1792084">This is a -- happens to be in the trucking industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.979" offset="1807339">A pattern type of contract which is modified from time to time depending upon the kind of freight that is involved whether it is dry freight, whether its petroleum, whether its cement or in this case whether it is new automobiles and trucks which are being moved from assembly plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.292" offset="1880586">As I said Local 89 is also for many years represented the employees of both Dealers and E &amp; L as well as other companies that are involved in this kind of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.284" offset="1936488">And that local union gives its power of attorney to an organization that is known as the National Truckaway and Driveaway Contracts for negotiation and signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.700" offset="1982151">Identical contracts are signed by each of the -- the individual employers but on the negotiation a master agreement is arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.659" offset="2026036">It is signed pursuant to the power of attorney by the employers -- by the employer's association on behalf of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.361" offset="2064802">It is signed by the National Truckaway Conference on behalf of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.683" offset="2090088">Then, subsequently, individual contracts are printed, distributed and signed by the individual local union having jurisdiction over the operations in a particular area and by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.120" offset="2135855">And the contract on record here will show the typewritten signature of the employer's association and I'll say for the employers and then the members of the employer's association who were on the negotiating Committee, let's say for the employees and then the members of the union who are on the union negotiating Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.139" offset="2211924">I think this is important incidentally because the court below apparently cannot quite digest this kind of unit and the -- this Court will note that in its decision it seemed to think that in as much as two individual contracts were signed that people working under one contract like the E &amp; L employees could not possibly assert any rights as against those employees who are working under the other contract or the dealers contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.625" offset="2337834">This was essentially dispute of course it is out position that this is a multi-employer unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.695" offset="2354134">It is a uniform agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.208" offset="2360195">It's binding upon all.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.492" offset="2365315">It applies to all employees in the unit and therefore the Court would actually in taking its decision attempted to fragmentize this multi-employer unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.887" offset="2406902">And actually it was doing that which we believe under the National Labor Relations Act is forbidden, it has no authority or power to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.935" offset="2439084">The current contract expires in 1964 and I would like to take the Court's time to indicate some of the provisions of the contract because again I believe that they are very in strictly bound up in the issues in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.662" offset="3569977">Now this agreement does provide that the National Truckaway and Driveaway Conference is the exclusive representative of all employees covered by the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.801" offset="3606549">It provides that the employer is bound by all the terms and provisions of agreement by -- and by all interpretations of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.077" offset="3635702">It provides that seniority rights for employers shall prevail and generally the rules set forth that seniority shall be by terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.607" offset="3669765">It further provides that when there is a controversy over a seniority standing this controversy shall be submitted to the joint grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.163" offset="3711979">This joint grievance procedure again is similar to contracts which have before this Court in both (Inaudible) and Riss.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.394" offset="3740923">In that, it starts at the local level by an attempt to adjust between the union and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.708" offset="3766209">Upon their failure to adjust there is a local bipartite Committee consisting of equal representatives of the union and equal representatives of the employers in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.207" offset="3816155">This Committee makes an effort to settle the dispute and if it does finally settle the dispute that is final and binding to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.806" offset="3850637">If they cannot reach an agreement at the local level, it then it goes to what is called a Joint Conference Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.873" offset="3878849">This is a national Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.706" offset="3886164">It is again composed of representatives of all of the national employers and all of the local union on a bipartite basis and equal number of each and this Committee does have the authority to make again final and binding determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.985" offset="3951261">If this Committee should deadlock and this is where this procedure varies from the Riss case for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.585" offset="3973726">Then there is provided that there must be submission to an impartial board of arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.451" offset="3993161">The -- the important thing in this procedure which marks it off from the problem which was before this case -- before this Court in the Riss case was the specific provision that the decision of the Joint Conference Committee shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the employer and the union and the employees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.378" offset="4100890">The Court will recall that there was a -- at least that was considered an ambiguous statement in Riss where instead of saying the decision shall be final and binding the contract language go, "shall be submitted for final decision."</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.958" offset="4159195">This is -- I think is clear as the intention of the parties can be expressed that the decision of a Committee particularly the Joint Conference Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the employer, the union and the employees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.096" offset="4235786">Incidentally, in the Dealers' brief filed here and there is a suggestion that Dealers might have had a right to deadlock this case at the Joint Conference Committee level and take it to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.732" offset="4290330">Contract is not give to any individual and employer or union that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.366" offset="4308825">Once a Committee makes the unanimous decision as was done in this case and -- and final arbitration is the final set only if there is a deadlock or there has been a deadlock and I believe that the mere reading of the contract will demonstrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.924" offset="4379042">Now, the important provision of the contract which gave rise to a litigation here on the merits below reads as follows, it would be found at record 10, it's Article 4, Section 5 of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.853" offset="4446751">In the event that the employer absorbs the business of another private contract or common carrier or is a party to a merger of lines the seniority of the employees absorbed or affected thereby shall be determined by mutual agreement between the employer and the unions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.917" offset="4598993">Any controversy with respect to such matter shall be submitted to the joint grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.458" offset="4641207">The contract further provided that it was the intention of the party to resolve all questions of interpretation by mutual agreement, factors and effort to preclude the Courts from making an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.156" offset="4691989">The contract has a printed signature as I pointed out of the various parties and then the individuals' signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.406" offset="4716962">Now, the facts which gave rise to the grievance and litigation relief, as I've pointed out Dealers and E &amp; L were engaged in the business of transporting new automobiles and trucks from the Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant at Louisville to various parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.416" offset="4801076">The court isn't -- is undoubtedly aware that this industry has been reset by automation problems also among which at least a form of automations effect that it has been found to be more economical than some instances to transport automobiles from what is called piggy-back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.582" offset="4873697">That is by a multilevel flat car to which are attached rails, automobiles are put on and this transported in maybe 20 or 30 or 40 cars of such kind can be transported then from one part of the country to the other and of course each flat car carries many more automobiles or trucks that can be loaded onto the average truckaway trailer which up to this point have been doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.809" offset="4978604">So these two companies were notified by the Ford Motor Company that because of its increasing use of this piggy-back operation, one of the two company services would no longer be required at Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.250" offset="5044328">Testimony up to that point was that Ford made no choice in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.180" offset="5068048">That all it had -- to have done was to announce to these two competitors, we will have use for only one of you in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.627" offset="5101902">The companies then apparently entered into an agreement while -- I shouldn't say apparently, they entered into an agreement which was not apparent at that time that Dealers would purchase the E &amp; L rights out in Louisville, the industry commerce rights, the rights to transport at Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.204" offset="5172224">In turn, E &amp; L would purchase Dealers' rights out of Ohio, Lorain, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.746" offset="5206392">And again in turn as a quid pro quo, E &amp; L would transfer to Dealers certain secondary rights which it had in Jackson, Mississippi, New Orleans and two or three other cities down south.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.062" offset="5267623">They had made this agreement and they have filed three separate applications with the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of the transaction but the nature of this transaction had never been revealed to the union or to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.728" offset="5350275">At least not before the grievance was filed and was on its way up to final adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.599" offset="5373785">The union representative after receiving complaints and inquiries from members of the union had a meeting with representatives of both companies and he was told there flatly that there was no kind of a trade between the two companies and only that Ford had taken the business from one company and given it to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.504" offset="5473364">On those facts, the union advised the employees of E &amp; L which was then losing the business that it looked pretty dark for them and perhaps they better seek other employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.482" offset="5533341">And on those facts, it assured the employees of Dealers that they would have no concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.863" offset="5574823">Again the testimony is that they qualify this opinion on the facts which were then available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.395" offset="5612962">Well, the E &amp; L employees then were laid off gradually and as they were laid off they filed a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.027" offset="5651519">They claimed that they were entitled to secure employment with Dealers because Dealers was taking over E &amp; L's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.591" offset="5689762">And that -- in that employment they were entitled to enjoy the same seniority rights which they enjoyed with E &amp; L, in other words, that the seniority board should be merged or dovetailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.314" offset="5748590">Now, in this industry when we talked of merging or dovetailing, we mean you take this -- in this case would be the seniority list of Dealers, the seniority list of E &amp; L and then you would make one master list depending upon the date of employment by either company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.853" offset="5822777">Obviously, although it wouldn't be here, this matter of dovetailing is bound to prejudice and to injure some employees who may have thought they had prior rights with their own employer which they were now losing by the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.913" offset="5883068">The grievance went to the local joint committee but there is also a provision of the contract that on all matters of interpretation whether they're raised by the union or by the employer, such matters must go to the Joint Conference Committee to the final step for determination or as it obvious that unless you have uniform interpretation of a uniform agreement it precludes its uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.436" offset="6001142">Well, because of that provision of the contract, the local union suggested at the local level that this matter be deadlock there and that it would sent to the next meeting of the Joint Conference Committee at the top level for determination as an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.669" offset="6082017">This joint conference meeting was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.780" offset="6094451">The union was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.133" offset="6103855">Dealers Transport employees were represented by three stewards who were elected by all employees of Dealers and who attended the meeting at the expense of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.730" offset="6162265">Similarly, the E &amp; L employees were represented by stewards who were elected by the employees of E &amp; L and whose expenses were also paid to the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.831" offset="6206673">Now, in the meantime, the union had made an examination of the federal registrar and had noted that these petitions were pending before the ICC and at that point the unions here changed because that it did appear that this was either a merger or absorption which would be covered by the provision of the contract to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.203" offset="6312208">So, when the matter got before the Committee, the chief officer of the union, Mr. Priddy, who normally sits as a member of the Committee, disqualified himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.958" offset="6355153">There's a Committee rule that no member of the Committee can sit on the case in which he is involved or which comes out of his jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.043" offset="6383574">Mr. Priddy disqualified himself and he made a presentation to this joint Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.553" offset="6409592">And he maintained that on these facts that are now disclosed by the federal register, there's obviously in Louisville a merger or an absorption of the business of one carrier by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.780" offset="6486497">Under those circumstances and under this provision of the contract, the employees of the absorbed company were entitled to assert their seniority at the absorbing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.238" offset="6544280">And he maintained that the proper disposition of the grievance at that point would be to construct a seniority list in a manner which I have indicated where all employees of Dealers whether they were initially employed by Dealers or whether they came to Dealers from E &amp; L would find their places on that master seniority list in accordance with their total years of service with either company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.256" offset="6656397">This of course as we've pointed out in our brief is not an unusual disposition of this kind of a dispute and generally is considered by the previous riders in the field at least and by some of the courts and some of the boards which have examined this thing as being the fairest kind of a disposition of this problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.094" offset="7311757">They were asked if they had anything further to present to the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.607" offset="7329834">Apparently, there was no objection made at that point that they didn't have notice that the union was going to change its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.150" offset="7371943">Incidentally, I think there is a serious question whether in -- in an interpretation case or in a bargaining case as this becomes subsequently as we shall see, that a right of representation is necessarily there at that point but I don't think we need to reach that point although it isn't discussed in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.543" offset="7449579">At this -- incidentally and this is a -- significant, the general manager of the Dealers and Vice President who is present at the Joint Conference Committee hearing testified with respect to the transaction between Dealers and E &amp; L and acknowledged that Dealers had and I quote, "absorbed a certain portion of E &amp; L business."</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.902" offset="7555009">Absorbed a certain portion of E &amp; L business which is the language using the contract clause, nor that Dealers at that time although now belatedly, a claim is made in the brief, protest that it had no advance knowledge of the union position or apparent change in position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.989" offset="7659290">On the contrary, it made what was apparently a frank disclosure of all of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.778" offset="7682487">When the Committee decision came down from two or three days later after which I had complete notice of the union possession, it made no protest but immediately proceeded to book the Committee decision into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.493" offset="7737344">Now the -- the case then started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.999" offset="7755316">The Dealers employees started to file a suit in the lower courts of Louisville, in which they claimed that they had relied on the union to present their grievance at the union that changes position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.607" offset="7797844">Therefore, it deceits them that the decision of a joint Committee was planned and contrived, that the decision was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the bargaining contract although the case actually was argued throughout mostly in the context of whether the decision is a violation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.080" offset="7871718">It does smack in some areas, the pleading down in the decision of the court below that perhaps some arbitrary or capricious action but were satisfied that on the record, neither does the complaint plead an adequate cause of action nor was such cause of action be sustained by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.343" offset="7948727">Now, I have perhaps taken too much time in the exposition of the facts but we do feel that these facts really are the operative facts and should dispose of the case on the decided law under the trilogy, under Riss, under cases dealing with the right of the collective bargaining agent to negotiate seniority problems and other problems based of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.494" offset="8041305">That aspect of the argument and as much as I've taken as much time as I have I will turn over to my associate Mr. Ratner.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mozart G. Ratner</label>
            <text syncTime="2005.534" offset="8125524">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.757" offset="8142451">In our view, the question presented by this case is whether Section 301 encompasses individual claims to future work opportunities which the exclusive bargaining agent in the collective interest allocates to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.525" offset="8217475">This is one of the problems that was mooted in Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.282" offset="8240462">The Court said there, when the employee and the union are in disagreement, the question is not which may sue but rather the extent to which one may conclude the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.920" offset="8303052">Unless Section 301 is now to be held to have subordinated the collective interest to the individual interest in such matters as allocation of future job opportunities, the unit in which seniority is to be computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.259" offset="8368358">And the uses of seniority deserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.184" offset="8384136">The exclusive representative must be able to conclude the individual in all such manners to the extent that the collective interests predominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.610" offset="8429798">Then whenever there is a conflict or disagreement between the individual and the exclusive representative, Section 301 must respect the collective authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.485" offset="8489357">We start then with this Court's recognition in Westinghouse that any federal substantive law collective bargaining contracts which may be developed must necessarily absorb the federal policy of supersedure of individual authority by collective authority when the majority selects an exclusive bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.847" offset="8582771">And of course we find this to be totally stated in the Lincoln Mills decision itself in which the parties are told but for the substantive federal law collective agreements is to be founded upon the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.298" offset="8652570">This Court said in Westinghouse that rights "which under state law are distributed among union members" become vested under federal law "in a legal entity recognized by federal law."</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.995" offset="8723310">Of course the rights so vested in the exclusive representative by those and only those in which the collective interest predominant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.365" offset="8764792">The distinction between areas in which the collective interests predominate and those in which the individual interest predominate is drawn of course in Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern versus Burley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.493" offset="8821321">Burley distinguishes between individual grievances on one hand and matters within the realm of collective bargaining on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.844" offset="8854758">The distinction is drawn in terms of whether the particular claim is monetary, whether it is fully vested, whether the remedy sought is wholly retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.119" offset="8899897">The individual seeks future status or prospective benefits so that the remedy and its negotiation will affect other members of the bargaining unit and future administration of the agreement his claim is not "uniquely personal" in the Westinghouse sentence and the collective interest predominant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.927" offset="8991117">Mr. Justice Douglas suggested in Footnote 9 of Lincoln Mills decision, an analogy to the Railway Labor Act cases where the individual's interest is deemed to predominate in a suit for damages for wrongful discharge, but the collective interest prevails where the individual seeks reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.416" offset="9069066">Those cases rest on the view that reinstatement affects the course of future collective bargaining whereas an award of damages for wrongful discharge is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.525" offset="9113475">The legislative history of the 1947 Amendments to Section 9 (a) shows that Congress thought it was acting in accord with the Burley decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.669" offset="9158092">As we see it, this Court has always assumed that Section 301 embody the Section 9 (a) 8 (d) allocation of authority between collective and individual interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.188" offset="9208142">In its dissenting opinion in Westinghouse, Mr. Justice Douglas with whom Mr. Justice Black concord observed, in short, the union represents the interest of the community of employees in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.525" offset="9257462">The wide range of its interest are envisaged by the Act would give the collective bargaining agency exclusive authority to bargain in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or other conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.771" offset="9314408">The range of its authority is the range of its interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.890" offset="9342934">In this context, we turn to Smith and Riss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.126" offset="9359862">Smith, of course, was an action by an employee to collect wages in the form of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.629" offset="9385880">That is of course the classic grievance in the Burley sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.032" offset="9407509">In relation to such a suit, this Court held no more than that Section 301 does not exclude all suits brought by employees instead of union to vindicate individual employee rights arising from a collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.896" offset="9494967">Mr. Justice Black thought there should be no question at all about the power of an individual to sue or enforce such a claim for money damages for wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.692" offset="9538121">Now Riss, it is true was a suit for reinstatement as well as for back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.522" offset="9565497">But there the individual plaintiffs in the union were not in disagreement so that no question of allocation of authority under Section 9 (a) and 8 (d) could have been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.726" offset="9606248">Moreover, on the assumption made by the Court in that case that the contract had been finally construed by the tribunal designated by the parties to construe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.760" offset="9646373">The case appeared to represent the equivalent of a suit by an individual to enforce rights vested in him by a final and binding arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.713" offset="9690258">Riss, it seems to us stands for the proposition of the E &amp; L petitioners here have a Section 301 right to enforce by suit the Joint Conference Committee award against Dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.263" offset="9760475">In this sense, they have the right to enforce the benefits that they achieved under an arbitration award as they would under a Court decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.482" offset="9809272">But neither Riss nor Smith implied that a suit will lie under Section 301 to set aside an agreement arrived at through collective bargaining allocating prospective job opportunities on the basis of seniority to entertain such a suit would be to use Section 301 to defeat instead of to enhance collective bargaining in respect for collective agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.462" offset="13453249">To this extent, the record is presented to the Court of Appeals, the transcript of it showed beyond any doubt that the two representatives of the Union, one named A. D. Berry, misrepresented to these employees and dealers, will all demand the security that the other fellow, the president of the Local goes over and makes a speech to the -- and shows in that record, to the E &amp; L workers, tell them, find a job some other place because the contract provides -- saved it for these men and dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.794" offset="13570591">And if you read that contract, you will find out it says that, seniorities shall prevail at all times and they make one exception, that's when a terminal closes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.114" offset="13615835">Now, this argument that they make here that -- they balled out and Mr. Justice Goldberg, you asked the question, “What happened over at Lorain, Ohio?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.408" offset="13660975">And here's the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.837" offset="13666722">Over at Lorain, Ohio, E &amp; L bought the terminal of Dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.099" offset="13683754">Over at Louisville, Dealers didn't buy a solitary thing, they had an auction sale and Dealers didn't buy a thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.819" offset="13966608">And here's the condition -- I'm glad you asked Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.333" offset="14060753">I'm a young, intelligent, aggressive employer, and I come in and hire me a bunch of young aggressive employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.880" offset="14134941">If we can't look back at that complaint to see whether it's right or wrong, what would keep those employees from out there from being sandwiched over here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.897" offset="14166915">And Ralph -- now Ralph said, "Well, I would see anything to it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.911" offset="14179035">Now, here is an equity in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.330" offset="14188648">This Court ought not to miss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.708" offset="14202232">You've got a group of young employees who did such a fine job and used to the same union, you refer the fact that the union took them up to Detroit, (Inaudible) home, and paid their way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.841" offset="14266702">They are paying the dues of -- bring all this band of lawyers here all the way from Saint Louis, Detroit, Milwaukee, maybe Detroit sir, these -- these men because of their very efficiency in their jobs find themselves in position whereby a union ruling, they lose their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.078" offset="14359698">The first week, 96 of them are displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.505" offset="14377357">And it wasn't until they came back here that they hired a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.304" offset="14396583">And they -- this is a matter of just -- that you'd have to use your judgment on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.198" offset="14412152">But, if the union hadn't pulled them, they'd had a lawyer a long time before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.767" offset="14434408">And we've got a declaratory judgment back in our state and I noticed in -- and the reason I was a little intrigued by the -- the opinion in Textile Mills against Lincoln Mills is because my friend Bardon, who was a congressional sector when I was over there in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.838" offset="14510686">Bardon says I want this to be a history, of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.974" offset="14527300">And he goes down there and asked, "Could employees", he didn't say Mr. Justice White, can just the unions and can just employers?</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.427" offset="14561050">Are they the only ones that have a right to a cause of action?</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.043" offset="14575574">Now, there'd been two dissents that brought this thing up, yours Mr. Justice Black and yours Mr. Justice Douglas, recent dissent in which you -- you say that the conventional method of writing a wrong ought not to be denied and that's in substance to your example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.426" offset="14657076">Ought not to be denied and you say Mr. Justice Douglas that the National Labor Relations Board is too far away in substance there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.987" offset="14691349">And Mr. Justice Goldberg handled that almost as well as anybody else because I am not a stranger to this labor movement.</text>

            <text syncTime="6153.147" offset="24715995">Now, the fascinating thing about it is basically what happened was that Ford Motor Company told Dealers and E &amp; L in Louisville that were was not enough business for two transport companies out of Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.987" offset="24783287">And one of them would have to get out or Dealers was obviously far more efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.554" offset="24809618">So Dealers sold its terminal at Lorain, Ohio where there's another Ford plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="6224.679" offset="25002088">So the thing that fascinates me and has from the beginning on this thing is, is this a merger or a consolidation or a transfer of what or an absorption of business?</text>
