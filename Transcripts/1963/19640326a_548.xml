            <text syncTime="6.745" offset="130382">Before leaving and concluding my argument, I would like to make it very clear that the State of Texas relies upon the affidavit opinion sale for stating probable cause in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.072" offset="179702">We stated in our brief and we still would contend that actually the affidavit would be sufficient even under the federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.730" offset="214288">And in support of that we would like to call the Court's attention to the case of Eisner versus United States found in 297 Federal Reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.418" offset="253053">In that case a federal court has upheld an affidavit which read as follows."</text>
            <text syncTime="44.533" offset="281475">Information has been obtained by SA Clifford Anderson, FBI, Cincinnati, Ohio which he believes to be reliable to the effect that Sam Eisner received first which were a part of the loot from the Davidson Indiana Fur Company in Kentucky after they have been transported from Indianapolis and had knowledge that they have been stolen."</text>
            <text syncTime="68.292" offset="376560">This particular affidavit certainly is no stronger than the one that we have in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.429" offset="401115">Certiorari was denied in this case and we would offer that in support of the fact that the affidavit found in the present case may even be of such standard that it would meet the federal requirement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clyde W. Woody</label>
            <text syncTime="158.095" offset="735796">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.909" offset="751052">One thing that I would like the Court to be cognizant of is my position so far as the hearsay is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.934" offset="787101">On page 11 of my brief, I'm not -- I am not attacking this proposition, this affidavit on the constitutionality of an affidavit based on hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.265" offset="836420">That's not my major contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.218" offset="848227">It is that it does not state sufficient facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.210" offset="868185">Now the Eisner case and the Rugendorf case that counsel has referred to do state facts distinguished from conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.461" offset="901204">And this Honorable Court in Nathanson versus United States, it is a matter of fact which was reaffirmed in Jones versus United States, the case that he relies on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.385" offset="948955">And in the Nathanson case, may it please the Court, here is the affidavit which this Court held inadequate and insufficient so far as this position is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.591" offset="993782">And here is the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.859" offset="1002768">Whereas, he said Francis B. Laughlin, has stated under his oath that he has cause to suspect and thus believe that certain merchandise to wit, certain liquors of foreign origin and more particular description of which cannot be given upon which is otherwise been bought into the United States contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.527" offset="1077478">And that said merchandise is now deposited and contained within the premises of JJ Nathanson, said premises being described as a two-storey framed building at 117 North Bartram Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.839" offset="1122722">And the Court said this about that particular affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.882" offset="1138918">It -- it went upon a mere affirmation of suspicion and belief without any statement of adequate supporting facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.910" offset="1174967">The -- the Court went further to say that under the Fourth Amendment the officer may not properly use a warrant to search a dwelling unless the -- it has been issued upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.221" offset="1224286">Now the Eisner case, there is not -- I submit -- is not employed in the Rugendorf case likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.309" offset="1260648">Now the Rugendorf case which counsel has cited, the affidavit is thusly.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.311" offset="1280606">Agent Moore of the FBI swore that an informer who had furnished reliable information in the past, reported to the affiant that he had seen 80 fur garments on the defendant's basement a few days previously, describing them as mink, otter and beaver jackets with labels removed.And that the informer had been told the fur was stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.545" offset="1365556">Now in that particular affidavit, the Court indicated that they did not discuss this proposition of facts, the Court merely said the appellant was urging in the Rugendorf that the affidavit was based on hearsay information and therefore was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.264" offset="1444446">And the same proposition was before the Court in Eisner.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.978" offset="1459284">Now these are of course two different propositions, one, hearsay and the Court has already dispose of that proposition that under some circumstances possibly, an affidavit may properly be based on hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.259" offset="1528456">However, it must state facts as distinguished from conclusions of law as the -- if the Giordenello case is still the law of this Court and still the law of this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.704" offset="1590209">And if Mapp and Ker mean what they say they mean that the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the State with the same degree and to the same extent that they are enforceable against the federal courts then this affid -- instant affidavit is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.631" offset="1673906">It is inconceivable to me to believe that if a federal agent or if the Federal Government brought into this Court, an affidavit and which ordered the arrest of an individual and other person or persons unknown and that such process was issued and executed and was relied upon and that a blanket warrant such as we have here was utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.092" offset="1799711">And I submit that this is almost -- this is very, very close to the affidavit and the warrant that jus -- that the Court considered in Marcus that was decided the same day as Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.856" offset="1858748">And two, the Justice -- two of the Justices agreed without the -- without it really being urged that this was a general warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.579" offset="1905664">And I submit that we have before us here a general warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.050" offset="1927607">It matters not I submit that the Court has spoken that the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the States if you allow the States the right to say by their legislation, "Yes, we will follow the constitutional laws of the United States but interpret them in such a manner that they do not do so."</text>
            <text syncTime="479.854" offset="2022797">That is what we have here and I submit that the proper procedure here would be to reverse this cause and to remand it to the Court of Criminal Appeals and to spell out with great particularity of certainty just what is required in an affidavit and search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.830" offset="2106702">Counsel has suggested throughout that while the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures should not be -- should not controlling on the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.206" offset="2148185">Well as far back as 1926 in the Olmstead case and in 1915 in the Weeks versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.048" offset="2179532">Long before the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were promulgated, we had the very same application of Rule 41 which is now Rule 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.855" offset="2226761">And as a matter of fact this Court held in Olmstead that it is a -- this is a part and parcel of the Fourth Amendment the -- a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.025" offset="2267512">Now I -- I don't see -- I've failed to appreciate how imposing upon the States the requirement that they follow the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment in this manner works any hardship and this -- this argument of federalism, I submit, has no merit to indicate just the -- just precisely how the Court of Criminal Appeals has confused the issues in a very -- in one of the cases that counsel cites in Giacona.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.904" offset="2410977">A dissenting opinion there and if I may I would like to read what -- one of the judges the Court of Criminal Appeals said, a man who's been on that court Judge Morrison for a very long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.759" offset="2462386">What we overlooked originally and what they failed to give application to on rehearing is the basic concept of the right of privacy as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.149" offset="2515989">And he underlines as interpreted by the Supreme Court, together with the fact that the Opinion in Mapp, the guarantees of that -- of that Amendment as so interpreted have been extended to those who are tried in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.712" offset="2594252">Now, at least one member of the Court of Criminal Appeals recognizes the fact that they have not been following the Fourth and Fifth Amendment as it is interpreted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.814" offset="2654647">And I submit that in reality, they have not been following a period.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.350" offset="2672724">And if the Court does not now find that such an affidavit and search warrant to be void then Mapp versus Ohio, Ker versus California has no meaning whatsoever so far as the states are concerned because the states that want to circumvent these particular statutes -- these particular holdings will merely enact the statutes such as Texas has and interpret it accordingly and there will be no real protection and there will be no effective right of privacy as guaranteed by the Constitutional laws of the United States and as has been interpreted by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.664" offset="2841997">Thank you very much.</text>
