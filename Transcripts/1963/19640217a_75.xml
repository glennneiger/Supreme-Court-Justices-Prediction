        <section startTime="0" stopTime="1814.358">
          <heading>Argument of Charles Hieken</heading>
          <turn speaker="charles_hieken" startTime="0.000" stopTime="748.895">
            <label>Mr. Charles Hieken</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- as construed by the court below to confer patent monopoly over an unpatented element that is not the discovery of an inventor.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.899" offset="146996">Our brief also discusses whether a final judgment, dismissing a complaint for a patent infringement, can include an advisory finding not relevant to deciding the case or controversy between the parties that a patent is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.318" offset="216691">We leave to our memorandum, filed last August, a discussion of respondent's motial -- motion to settle order in which respondent seeks to exclude certain material related to respondent's inequitable conduct in violation of the antitrust laws and misusing combination patents to restrain trade of non-patented goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.418" offset="305089">We turn, first, to a discussion of the scope of the combination patent monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.119" offset="323897">The combination patent here in suit is entitled convertible automobile folding top with automatic seal at the rear quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.686" offset="358066">Now, the combination patent in suit here covers a combination of elements which function together to affect a water-tight seal at the rear quarter of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.571" offset="405608">One of the elements in the patented combination is the unpatented fabric element.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.666" offset="426088">There is no separate claim to the fabric and, therefore, the fabric element is itself not patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.971" offset="451271">Ford and General Motors cars for the years in the early 1950s embodied the patented combination as original equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.991" offset="491290">The petitioners make, sell, and on occasion install only replacements for the unpatented fabric element of the patented combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.016" offset="531414">As a result of this activity, respondent charged petitioners with infringement and contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.816" offset="562657">The District Court, the first time around, found both infringement and contributory infringement arising from the manufacture, installation, and sale of these unpatented replacement fabrics for both Ford and General Motors cars, and accordingly entered an interlocutory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.826" offset="634650">The Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.573" offset="649697">This Court then granted certiorari and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.609" offset="669759">After denying respondent's petition for rehearing or any alternative, a motion for a clarification of opinion in which respondent advanced the same arguments that it had advanced in its brief on the merits and is now advancing in this hearing that it was entitled to patent monopoly over replacement fabrics for Ford cars even though it wasn't entitled to monopoly rights over replacement for General Motors cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.672" offset="782085">This Court then remanded the case directly to the Massachusetts District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.933" offset="799117">The Massachusetts District Court, first, entered final judgment, dismissing the complaint with cause to petitioners and dismissing petitioners' counter claim without cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.363" offset="852825">At the same time, it held the patent valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.790" offset="866513">We move to amend and, accordingly, the District Court struck out the finding of validity from its final judgment and also amended the final judgment to expressly state that the dismissal of our counter claim was without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.923" offset="935058">Respondent then appealed from this decision of the District Court, claiming that it was entitled to monopoly rights over the unpatented replacements for Ford cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.315" offset="976645">And, petitioners cross-appealed, claiming that the record, then before the court, required a conclusion that not only had respondent and its assignor misused the combination patent to restrain trade of non-patented replacement fabrics and was, therefore, barred for maintaining either an action for a direct or contributory infringement, but also had violated the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.305" offset="1088554">Well, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court final judgment and reinstated that portion of its prior judgment that had been reversed by this Court dealing with replacement fabrics for Ford cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.591" offset="1149785">And, they conferred patent monopoly over some unpatented replacement fabrics for Ford cars, depending upon the interpretation of a private agreement between respondent's assignor and the Ford Motor Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.902" offset="1206941">In that private agreement, Ford had released -- or rather respondent's assignor had released Ford and owners of its cars from liability arising from the manufacture, use, and sale of the patented convertible automobile but expressly reserved the right and exercise the right to license the manufacture, use, and sale of the unpatented replacement fabrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.668" offset="1318013">The Court of Appeals, in reviewing the decision of this Court, said that what the Court said in its opinion gave it little guidance, but what the Court did not say, it felt, meant that the Court was not deciding the question as to the unpatented fabrics for so-called “unlicensed Ford cars.”</text>
            <text syncTime="326.395" offset="1408920">And, while the Court of Appeals did quote what this Court said was the principle and determinative question presented here, whether the owner of a combination patent comprised entirely of unpatented elements has an additional patent monopoly on the manufacture, sale, and use of the several unpatented components of the patented combination, the Court of Appeals did not quote the answer that this Court gave to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.217" offset="1532217">And, this Court answered that question by saying “no element, not itself separately patented, that constitutes one of the elements of a combination patent is entitled to patent monopoly, however essential it may be to the patented combination and no matter how difficult or costly replacement may be.”</text>
            <text syncTime="378.417" offset="1617063">Now, it's silly to distinguish between the replacement fabrics for Ford cars and for General Motors cars because the replacement fabrics for Ford cars are just as unpatented as those for General Motors cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.907" offset="1670980">And, this Court pointed out the basic fallacy in respondent's position in the prior opinion as follows, which is just as applicable today.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.027" offset="1707447">They said the basic fallacy in respondent's position is that it requires ascribing to one element of the patented combination the status of patented invention in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.383" offset="1760946">Now, the interlocutory judgment that was reviewed and reversed previously by this Court dealt with replacement fabrics for both Ford and General Motors cars, and whatever was before the Court was finally disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.440" offset="1817161">And, the Court of Appeals had no basis for reexamining the disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.755" offset="1838373">The Court recently held so in NAACP versus Alabama in 360 U.S., and that case cited Siebel versus United States way back in 12 Peters.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.239" offset="1896364">It is also inconsistent with the Mercoid cases to confer monopoly rights in the unpatented replacement fabrics for Ford cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.142" offset="1939937">In the Mercoid cases, this Court decided that the combination patentee could not restrain trade or prevent competition in the sale of a non-patented element for original installation in a patented machine that was sold without the patentee's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.453" offset="2025200">A fortiori, the combination patentee cannot forbid the sale of a non-patented replacement fabric for a replacement installation in a patented machine that was sold with the patentee's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.731" offset="2082252">Now, respondent will say that it wasn't sold with the patentee's consent because it was only a release that was granted to the owners of the Ford cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.871" offset="2130840">But, the fact is that respondent's assignor got $73,000 from the Ford Motor Company in exchange for release from all liability arising from the manufacture, use, and sale of these patented machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.484" offset="2189354">It seems reasonably obvious that the respondent or its assignor could not have maintained an action for a direct infringement against the Ford car owner after it had released the owners of the Ford cars from liability and since a liability for contributory infringement is predicated upon their first being liable -- liability for a direct infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.844" offset="2294784">We do not see how respondent could possibly maintain an action for a contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.162" offset="2324041">Moreover, if we accept respondent's contention in this case, we're going to be departing from a long line of patent antitrust cases in which this Court has consistently held that the patentee is forbidden from expanding the scope of this combination patent monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.892" offset="2402931">That line of cases dates back to 1917 when this Court entered its opinion in the Motion Picture Patents case back in 243 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.953" offset="2443160">And, only recently, in United States versus Loews, Inc., this Court restated the significance of that line of cases in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.055" offset="2483597">The Court said “these cases reflect a hostility to use of the statutorily granted patent monopoly to extend the patentee's economic control to unpatented products.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.406" offset="2533021">The patentee is protected as to his invention but may not use his patent rights to exact tribute for other articles.”</text>
            <text syncTime="615.138" offset="2563950">And, that's just exactly what respondent and its assignor have done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.193" offset="2584116">They have expanded a pair of combination patent monopolies to restrain trade in these unpatented replacement fabrics and we say that that conduct is to be measured by the antirust laws, as this Court pointed out in the second Mercoid case, the legality of any attempt to bring unpatented goods within the protection of the patent is measured by the antirust laws, not the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.930" offset="2691114">Now, the court below didn't say that the record didn't show an antirust law violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.586" offset="2713684">The Court of Appeals said that the short answer to petitioner's claim, as appellants below seeking relief from the consequences of respondent's antitrust law violations, is that they never pleaded a cause of action under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.948" offset="2787140">Well, I'm just going to read an excerpt from the pleading and you'll notice in the opinion of the court of -- it's pages 10-11, at the bottom of page 10, “you'll notice in the opinion of the Court of Appeals that they do not quote any portion of our pleading.”</text>
            <text syncTime="685.732" offset="2846281">We said, in our answer in counter claim, said “Automobile Body Research Corporation,” that's respondent's assignor, “has entered into at least one licensing agreement and/or has caused others to be sublicensed under agreements improperly extending the scope of the claim's subject matter of said patent and has thereby misused said patent and has improperly restrained commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="709.960" offset="2943248">And, on December 13, 1962, the Court of Appeals handed down its opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.280" offset="2976475">10 days before, this Court had reversed that very Court of Appeals in the case of Fullman versus Davis, and this is what the Court said in considering the sufficiency of a pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.584" offset="3037706">If the -- this was in 371 U.S. “if the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a pleader may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.482" offset="4933256">That this is a case where this respondent, Shell Su Incorporation, was set up in the month of April of 1956, assigned a territorial grant limited to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in this patent and, in that same month, brought this suit against these petitioners and the whole time the record shows that that's all this respondent has been doing is maintaining this suit against these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.907" offset="5035029">And, whenever its assignor wants some kind of an agreement to help it further its scheme to license this unpatented replacement fabrics, right away, the agreements flow from respondent, and whenever respondent needs some additional rights to come from respondent's assignor, why, respondent's assignor gladly assigns its -- whatever rights are needed, and that was shown in the record after the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.350" offset="5160730">Respondent went all through this case until the judgment of the Court of Appeals, with just a territorial grant, limited the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.331" offset="5196675">Then, after they win, or apparently have won, they get an assignment from respondent's assignor in which the rest of the rights in this combination patent to the United States is assigned to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.111" offset="5247770">Then, respondent goes into the District Court and says “look, I have all the rights in this patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.714" offset="5266265">Now, it's not necessary for the master to segregate damages between Massachusetts and the rest of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.145" offset="5299911">At the same time, he asked for a permanent injunction, forbidding us from selling these unpatented replacement fabrics and then denying these motions if this conduct apparently got too much for the District Court because it said that it was not at all satisfied with the plaintiff's ingenious appearing explanation as why it is trying to increase its bets now that its horse is practically across the finish line and, in all probability, a winner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.795" offset="5414536">So, this case finally comes down to this, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.538" offset="5429478">An owner of a combination patent cannot treat an unpatented element of that combination as if it were patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.776" offset="5462497">And, if he does, if an addition to deriving his profits from the patented machine on which the law gives him a monopoly, he also tries to derive his profits from the unpatented replacement elements necessary to the continued use and operation of the machine, he violates the antitrust laws and is subject to the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.024" offset="5551417">We respectfully urge the Court to discourage other combination patentees from repeating the illegal activities apparent in this record by relieving petitioners of the consequences of respondent's antitrust law violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.876" offset="7390856">When this case was argued here three years ago, the petitioner at that time was represented by Mr. Wolf and, also, the views of the government were expressed by Mr. Spritzer, appearing for the Solicitor General's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.530" offset="7445504">At that time, Mr. Wolf advanced the very arguments which were advanced during Mr. Hieken's main argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.833" offset="7482702">Mr. Spritzer, however, appearing for the Solicitor General's Office, declined to join Mr. Wolf in finding or in urging any antitrust violation or any misuse of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.124" offset="7531917">And, he urged at that time that the essential issue in this case was one of direct infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.231" offset="7552293">Subsequently, three years ago, this Court rendered its decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.130" offset="7575907">And, at that time, the majority opinion, as well as the minority or dissenting opinion and the other opinions, all made it very clear that the real important issue here, the vital issue, was one of direct infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.039" offset="7627525">As a matter of fact, Mr. Justice Black's concurring opinion in the case termed that issue of direct infringement the crucial issue and went on to say that, since that was the crucial question, if you will, he felt that these other comments about misuse and the like were confusing and beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.902" offset="7706937">Today, three years later, we are still concerned with this vital question of direct infringement, except that, today, we are concerned with a different aspect of it than was primarily here before the Court three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.882" offset="7762944">Three years ago, the questions of Ford and General Motors cars and the distinctions between them were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.541" offset="7793560">However, no one seriously contended at that time that there was any error with respect to Ford cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.676" offset="7818115">As a matter of fact, during colloquy with Mr. Spritzer, I recall that Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out that, in his understanding, Mr. Spritzer was advancing arguments only with respect to General Motors cars and that they did not apply to Ford cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.974" offset="7883316">And, Mr. Spritzer conceded that that was the case and of course, in Mr. Brennan's concurring opinion, we find an expressed distinction made between Ford cars in the other subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.105" offset="7927829">Now, what is this distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.269" offset="7940472">The first aspect that we're talking about, the General Motors cars that were primarily here three years ago are so-called “license structures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.223" offset="7976312">And, at that time three years ago, the primary question before the Court related to a licensed user's liability when he repaired a structure -- a patented structure which he had acquired from some sanctioned source, such as the patentee or his licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.178" offset="8052067">Today, we are concerned with a different aspect, the Ford aspect, concerning in unlicensed user's liability when he repairs a structure covered by patent which was acquired from an infringing source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.016" offset="8111417">And, it is our view that these differences, this licensed-unlicensed distinction is so vital a distinction, so fundamental a distinction as to involve entirely different rationales, entirely different questions of public policy, entirely different lines of precedent and as to require entirely different results.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.532" offset="8233462">It is our view -- the crux of our view, in effect, that even though what was discussed three years ago was found to be no more than repair, insofar as license structures were concerned, this is no defense as to unlicensed structure, in that, a repair of an unlicensed structure is itself an act of direct infringement since it perpetuates the infringement and prolongs its life.</text>

            <text syncTime="3762.008" offset="15151417">If the Court now accepts Aro's present argument and holds that the same rule applies even as to unlicensed structures, the two Aro decisions taken together will, in effect, say that a replacement part manufacturer can never be liable for the sale of any part for installation on any combination which is either licensed or unlicensed.</text>
