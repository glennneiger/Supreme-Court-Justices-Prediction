            <text syncTime="45.150" offset="283982">Petitioners here are members of the bar of the State of New York, engaged in the general practice of law under the firm name of Rabinowitz and Boudin.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.757" offset="326405">Since this case is here, on a motion for judgment of the pleadings, the facts are -- is set forth on the complaint, and I will just briefly state what the complaint said with regard to the matter in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.932" offset="387114">According to the allegations of the compliant, petitioners were retained on or about September 10th of 1960, by the Republic of Cuba to represent that Government in purely mercantile and financial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.880" offset="454928">The retainer does not cover advice and representation involving public relations, propaganda, lobbying, or political or any other non-legal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.431" offset="513128">And the petitioners have not in fact represented the Republic of Cuba in any respect other than in mercantile and financial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.221" offset="556283">In August of 1961, of the respondent, the Attorney General here demanded that petitioners register with him in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.587" offset="613752">Petitioners came down to Washington and discussed the matter with the representatives and subordinates of the Attorney General and they maintained that their representation of the Republic of Cuba did not fall within the purview of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.304" offset="676551">And that as a matter of fact; they were expressly exempted from the Act by the provisions of simply Section 3 (d) which exempt individuals who engage in purely mercantile and financial matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.939" offset="827120">They admitted the allegations of the compliant and then they went on to say, "They did not have any sufficient information and belief to determine whether there was anything more."</text>

            <text syncTime="455.604" offset="1925831">And that I say demonstrates the nature of the type of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.335" offset="1944743">At -- the petitioners, after their discussion with the Attorney General, in which they came to an impasse, filed a suit in the District Court, asking for declaratory relief, declaring that their activities are -- do not subject them to the requirements of registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.147" offset="2011930">They attach to the complaint and I think it's important to consider here the nature of the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.500" offset="2037321">As exhibits, the registration forms which had been adopted by the Attorney General and which petitioners would be required to complete if they were required to register under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.218" offset="2088208">And this form would require petitioners to disclose all of their businesses, occupations and public activities without regard to any relationship of these activities to their representation of the Republic of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.389" offset="2140975">They would be required to list all of their other law clients or any other outside activities which they may have outside their law business, and all talks, pictures, radio broadcasts which they may have made or articles or books which they may have written.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.870" offset="2206804">The form would also require them to list all of their stockholdings on any pecuniary interest they may have in any other corporations or any other business enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.036" offset="2243480">Again, without regard to any relationship, these other business enterprises might have with their representation of their foreign principal, the Republic of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.177" offset="2284126">In addition, the complaint alleges that because of the nature of their retainer, our counsel find it necessary to bring litigation in courts throughout the country and that in this connection, they find it necessary to retain associate counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.048" offset="2343581">And attached to the complaint is another form of the Attorney General which the Attorney General would require all associate counsel to complete, and this form would require anybody who is associated even in a individual case for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.600" offset="2405752">They would have to disclose all visits to or residences in foreign countries within the past five years or club, societies, committees or other non-business organizations of the United States or elsewhere, of which they had been members, directors or -- and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.773" offset="2474506">Then also all books, magazines, articles, pictures which the associate counsel may have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.517" offset="2501465">And the complaint alleges, and I think it's clear that this burden put upon associate counsel would make it extremely difficult for petitioners here to retain associate counsel in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.273" offset="2552456">Associate counsel maybe willing to commit to a case but not at the price of such a disclosure, an invasion to their privacy, and they alleged that -- I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.307" offset="3600593">But the case came before the District Court on the basis really of the allegations and the compliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.430" offset="3621073">The Government -- Government moved there for a judgment on the pleadings and the District Court denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.039" offset="3647509">The Government then applied to the District Court's belief to bring an interlocutory appeal stating and asking the Court to certify that there was a controlling issue in this case, namely, whether or not the petitioners could bring an action for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.851" offset="3722742">And under a new statute 1292 (b), the District Court certified that an interlocutory appeal could be taken on that question alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.565" offset="3765582">That question was a -- here was accepted by the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals heard it on that question and reversed the District Court holding that the action could not be brought in a divided opinion with the dissent by Judge Fahy.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.418" offset="3829008">We say therefore, the case is before the Court in the present posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.308" offset="3848652">The trial court held that on the facts, and I think we must assume that on the facts set forth in the complaint, petitioners are exempt from the requirement of registration under the Act and they're not required to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.378" offset="3900897">And the Government appealed on the ground and this is the only issue before the Court, that assuming that they are exempt and are not required to register, are they entitled to have a court declare that in this declaratory judgment proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="966.748" offset="3970382">And they raised two questions, and there are two question related with respect to that single basic issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.415" offset="4000998">One, is this an appropriate case for declaratory judgment relief and two, whether the action is an unconsented suit against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.438" offset="4041122">We submit that the same considerations really should determine the answer to both questions but I think for the purpose of orderly presentation, I wish to discuss first the question of whether this is an appropriate case for declaratory judgment relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.204" offset="4100159">We have set out at page 24 of our main brief, the leading case in this Court on declaratory judgment relief, setting out the factors that must be satisfied before a case was appropriate for declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.521" offset="4161494">And we say and I think I want to discuss it only briefly because I don't know if the Government disputes it seriously, that we made all of those requisites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.162" offset="4195976">One, the controversy here is definite and concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.295" offset="4212590">It is not hypothetical and abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.339" offset="4228681">We contend that under the statute, the legal representation of a foreign government in purely financial, mercantile matters is exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.957" offset="4259192">The Government contends on the contrary that the statutory exemption does not apply, as I understand their argument, where the foreign principal is a foreign government or at least as it seems to have modified its position in its brief here, at least where that foreign government controls the means of production in commerce within its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.888" offset="4338918">That is the concrete legal issue posed by the pleadings and by the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.121" offset="4359816">The controversy again, dealing with the language of the Acme case, it touches the legal relations of parties having adverse and legal interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.337" offset="5108694">We don't think the Act is a threat, but we think its formal demand that we register, writing a letter and saying, "You are under the Act and you should register."</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.002" offset="5151431">The fact that we had a conference with him and we said, "We are not under the Act, we do not have to register."</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.613" offset="5173791">And he said, "I remain unconvinced by your arguments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.548" offset="5193540">That is my interpretation of the law."</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.376" offset="5204825">I say, beyond that, I think that's sufficient to make the -- make the controversy sharp and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.588" offset="5237739">If then, the only step remaining was for him to bring a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.664" offset="5254040">I think it was fair for the petitioners to assume that if the Attorney General believed that they were under the Act and that they didn't register that he would prosecute because there's no purpose in his formal demand other than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.593" offset="5309733">Now, we can't say that he was conceivable that he might have changed his mind or he might have been bluffing, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.865" offset="5338781">But I think the issue has been sharply enough proposed to this point to permit a declaratory judgment relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.065" offset="5371591">Finally, we say, the controversy admits a specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.921" offset="5399071">In other words, the judgment of this Court saying that the petitioners on the basis of their conceded activities either were or were not under the coverage of the Act would end this dispute in a final manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.406" offset="5452988">The Government argues nonetheless that the Court should not entertain this action and it has really two basic positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.373" offset="5484857">I think first -- well, let's say there are three grounds in which it advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.763" offset="5502412">First, it says that the scheme of the Act is such that Congress intended to make a criminal prosecution the exclusive means of testing the applicability and the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.867" offset="5554866">Now, the Government points to no statutory language to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.841" offset="5570748">The statute doesn't say -- the statute simply provides that on a failure to register, it's a crime and the Attorney General may prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.790" offset="5602513">It doesn't say that this is the sole and exclusive way in which the validity of the Act can be tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.499" offset="5625396">It doesn't say you can't bring a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.155" offset="5643995">But the Government argues that Congress had that purpose and it argues it from the general congressional purpose underlying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.855" offset="5678791">And it sets out at considerable length in its brief, pages 15 to 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.946" offset="5703137">The general purpose of this Foreign Agents Registration Act and they point out quite correctly and we -- we agree with them that Congress passed this Act because they wished to force those engaged in the dissemination of propaganda on behalf of the foreign principal to register so that people who read this foreign propaganda and read this propaganda would know the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.872" offset="5806895">And that these individuals would not be able to operate in secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.322" offset="5824658">That is to put out foreign propaganda without disclosing that you're a -- in fact, a foreign agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.172" offset="5856110">What is applied to this case, this argument about a denial of declaratory judgment relief because of that general theory and philosophy underlying the Act is just plain nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.185" offset="5912116">In the first place, petitioners here are not engaged in any propaganda or any public relations or lobbying activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.009" offset="5943359">In the second place, there's nothing about their representation to their foreign principal which is secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.438" offset="5969168">On the contrary, they have stated not only by bringing this action but they have appeared in Court in numerous occasions as they have appeared in this Court and have stated that they represent the Republic of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.501" offset="6021413">So, there's no question here about somebody seeing propaganda or issue by the petitioners, which they don't issue and not knowing that they -- comes from them when they have not -- there are no secrets about their representation of the Republic of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.804" offset="6086614">We say it demonstrates quite clearly and it's a -- so the demonstration that has come out even sharp -- more sharply in a recent hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which I will come to later, about considering amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.665" offset="6150040">That the problem which gives rise to this present case and which has created the problem is the effort of the Department of Justice to apply the Act which was designed as you read the legislative history, the quotations and everything that the Government sets fort in its brief, it was of design to cover foreign propaganda agents who were secret about their connection with their foreign principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.050" offset="6251604">And the Government has now taken this statute and tried to apply it in a completely different situation, has tried to apply it to lawyers who were not engaged in propaganda and who do not conceal their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.546" offset="6301550">And we also show that, if anything their legislative history would prove, is that the Act does not apply to the petitioners at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.420" offset="6349093">Secondly, is their second basic position, the Government argues that the complaint fails to state an equitable cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.867" offset="6378872">And they say that in essence, although we started a declaratory judgment action, the action would in effect, if the Court considers it, amount to a restraint on a criminal prosecution, and that equity will not ordinarily enjoin a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.455" offset="6449194">And again, it argues at great length matters which we do not dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.556" offset="6465599">That is that a declaratory judgment action has to be tested by ordinary equitable principals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.865" offset="6486810">We concede that, and I think the Government believe as the obvious by making such a point to that in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.715" offset="6514186">But we say that this case meets the ordinary equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.755" offset="6538428">In the first place, to meet ordinary equitable principals, you have to show that the prosecution itself will present an irreparable injury far beyond that which is normally attached to a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.421" offset="6601017">Now, what are the penalties imposed here upon the petitioners if they do not register?</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.665" offset="6625991">They're criminally prosecuted and if they are possibly successfully convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.524" offset="6657442">The penalties imposed by the statute are severe we point out in our brief as many of the cases in which this Court has entertained declaratory judgment actions or given injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.436" offset="6717106">Briefly, the petitioners would be punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $10,000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.976" offset="6743228">And even more than that, since they are members of the bar, being convicted of a felony would be -- bring about considerable damage to their reputation and quite likely disciplinary proceedings before their bar association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.973" offset="6811251">Now, the Government is very sanguine about that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.563" offset="6825671">There we fraught to the present case, this curious they say that there's really nothing for petitioners here to worry about because this is really a test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.970" offset="6863287">They say an indictment and prosecution would not reflect on and I'm quoting now on petitioner's honesty and integrity, "Since it would involve only the legal question whether their conceded activities as counsel for a foreign government bring them within the Act's registration requirements."</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.077" offset="7111659">Now, we submit that petitioners here cannot really feel so comfortable about the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.859" offset="7150843">A criminal prosecution really is not the proper forum for a test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.356" offset="7172786">And a successful prosecution here will not culminate in the mere order to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.443" offset="7197132">It will amount to a conviction of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.848" offset="7210715">And quite interestingly enough, appearing in a different context and that is testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the hearings on S. 2136 on amendments to the Foreign Agents Registration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.816" offset="7274663">Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach took quite a different view of the serious nature of a prosecution under this Act particularly with respect to its application to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.813" offset="7330670">And he told the Congress there that -- and I'm reading now from page 3 of my reply brief according to Mr. Katzenbach as he testified before the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.353" offset="7388766">He said, "Of course Senator, the penalty of being convicted of a felony even if the fine was small or if no jail sentence was imposed, can in many instances be a very heavy penalty indeed just simply to have a conviction."</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.423" offset="7449057">This is not true in the corporate situation but in the individual situation, there had been convicted of a felony for example in the case of a lawyer amounts to automatic disbarment in most instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.281" offset="7500466">I do not know whether a year in jail added to that has very much when he has that kind of a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.367" offset="7524812">And perhaps Attorney General Katzenbach overstated the point but I wish to indicate that when petitioners here had apprehensions and sought this declaratory judgment relief, they did have a very serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.165" offset="7576012">They cannot simply sit by and say that it was simply a test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.751" offset="7598373">As a matter of fact, I would submit that the penalty here is as great and as much an in terrorem nature as in the classic case of Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.577" offset="7641631">Quite frankly, although as much as petitioners prize their right of privacy here that absent -- this avenue of judicial relief, I think the petitioners would hesitate very much to test their legal rights in any criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.009" offset="7723447">And in all likelihood, rather than risk the hazards of a criminal prosecution, and despite the affirmed conviction authority to exempt and not required to register, they probably would register rather than face their problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.935" offset="7779140">As a matter of fact, the respondent boasts to some extent that 94 of the law firms and individuals have registered under this Act without raising a peep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.932" offset="7827101">Now, I submit they were face with that same kind of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.065" offset="7839640">We assume here that they were under the Act in which there was no question or they thought they were exempt too but they decided that, "Well, these are valuable rights of privacy, but we're not going to take a chance."</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.874" offset="7914872">Well, let me say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.900" offset="7923022">We alleged in our complaint that there was no administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.605" offset="7941831">The Attorney General said in his answer that there was no administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.280" offset="7956459">He says in his brief here and apparently in recognition that there is a real problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.674" offset="7986030">He says there is no real -- I think at one point this brief said, it would be a great injustice if this Court dismissed the suit because you could always come in and discuss the matter with the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.779" offset="8030438">And he has discussed it with people and advised them whether or not they would register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.493" offset="8049351">Now, I don't think he suggest that that's an administrative remedy because that seems to me to be ineffective administrative remedy, we would have to have some kind of a formal proceeding subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.802" offset="8098565">Now, if there was that judicial remedy, I think we have exhausted it to the extent we'd have that dis -- discussion with the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.083" offset="8131688">He has given us his view and we still disagree with him and I know of no other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.913" offset="8154990">I would like to point out however and this is a matter that came to our attention after we wrote the brief and which is quite significant however that it appears in the hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, particularly in the testimony of Mr. Arthur Dean, that the Attorney General has told some lawyers in law firms that they don't have to register if they merely give legal representation and not trying to lobby or promote anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.050" offset="8271600">So, he has given relief to some but not to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.978" offset="10307271">In short, my real question is what is willfulness under this statute mean?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_rein" startTime="2555.721" stopTime="2788.385">
            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="2555.721" offset="10326288">Well, I would contend that willfulness means what the Attorney General says it means here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.251" offset="10344364">That means that you have to believe that you're under the Act and there has to be some element of secrecy involved as the -- under the purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.233" offset="10376338">I don't think that's the question or that would be a question before the Court on the question of whether or not we're exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.139" offset="10403924">I don't think the Court has to get into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.010" offset="10411447">But certainly it would be our contention that willfulness would have to have the criminal element, the element of -- of concealment in -- in view of the nature of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.176" offset="10464110">We like to point out further with regard to whether or not we bring a -- a standard case for declaratory judgment relief that -- and I think the Government here concedes that this is the kind of a statute that is normally referred to as a regulatory statute in which it doesn't involve the kind of things normally including moral turpitude on (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.242" offset="10560345">Now, the legislative history of the Declaratory Judgment Act and all of the commentators and we set them out in our main brief at some length, point out that the Act was designed so as to permit tests of the validity and meaning of regulatory statutes of this nature, without making the risk of a criminal penalty, the price of a challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.211" offset="10656266">And we suggest that the position taken by the Government in this brief, that this is a test case, indicates that it's the very kind of a case that should be brought in a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.926" offset="10707048">And we have further fortified in that, again, by further testimony given by Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach, in his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.269" offset="10756472">He there argued that because of the difficulties that the Attorney General had with the statute, that he asked the Government, the Congress, to give the Department of Justice the power to bring injunctions to get in order to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.196" offset="10836198">And quite interestingly, in the course of his testimony, he said as follows, he was asked by Senator Sparkman, whether under the existing legislation, the Department could bring an injunctive action at the present time and he said, "I think not Senator."</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.773" offset="10894503">And I'm reading now from page 5 of my reply brief."</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.330" offset="10908714">There had been a couple of instances of a declaratory judgment but this is where the action is brought, not by the Government but by a potential defendant and he has the capacity to go into court and say that the Government is threatening him with a criminal prosecution if he does what he is entitled to do and he can get a declaratory judgment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.926" offset="11003068">We do not have the same sort of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.187" offset="11016129">We suggest therefore, that at least in Attorney General -- Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach's opinion, this is an ideal case for declaratory judgment relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.165" offset="11060015">And in fact, he represented to the Congress that you could bring a declaratory judgment action and argued that the Department of Justice should have the same privilege or bringing injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.083" offset="11103692">Now, I like to suggest that the Senate Committee did oblige the Attorney General by introducing in the provisions of S. 2136 which is a bill which is still pending before Congress, a provision which would give the Attorney General power to bring injunctive actions to get an order requiring registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.204" offset="11184149">Now, I can only suggest that the Senate did not do the same thing on the declaratory judgment side because presumably they had been assured by the Deputy Attorney General that right already existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.895" offset="11230960">And it was necessary to amend the legislation in order to permit bringing such action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.967" offset="12155277">Before I get into that, I wanted just to discuss very briefly, what seems to me to be a somewhat unfortunate pleading problem which was raised by the court below and by the Government here and by numerous flattering references to what competent counsel did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.293" offset="12228524">Now apparently, competent counsel, according to the Government and the court below, didn't plead a proper case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.289" offset="12252557">I can only say for myself, since I was the competent or incompetent counsel as the case maybe, I tried to plead the case the best I could and I wasn't leaving anything out at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.564" offset="12301667">Now, (Inaudible) -- in the first place and we have and I don't think it necessary, I have just discussed and set out some quotations in our main brief at page 13 about the interpretation of the federal rules of pleading and how they're supposed to be construed in order to reach the merits of a controversy rather than to put obstacles in the path of -- of deciding the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.683" offset="12410128">And I think that our pleadings fairly construed would permit me to argue anything that I wish to argue and that if they were not so construed, I would've asked leave to amend and I'm sure the court below would've given the leave to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.805" offset="12466552">Now, with that preface, I said that the sovereign immunity doctrine does not apply here even under the strictest formulation of that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.356" offset="12504795">And that formulation given it to by the Government and we will assume the formulation here, is that you cannot sue a government official unless you alleged one of two things, that he has exceeded his statutory authority or that there is a constitutional barrier to exercising that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.003" offset="12591417">We say that, we could come within both aspects of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.043" offset="12607509">We have pleaded in our complaint and we would argue here, that since Congress has expressly exempted, expressly exempted our petitioners from the coverage of the Act, the demand of the Attorney General, that the petitioners register is in excess of his statutory authority and we make that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.465" offset="12697266">Now, I think that you can't get around it on the question of pleading that we haven't made the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.650" offset="12717955">The only answer that was given, was given by the court below and the Government, in the brief here, is that the Attorney General, he maybe wrong about whether the statute covers us or not and we maybe expressly exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.623" offset="12781902">But he has not exceeded his statutory authority because he has the statutory authority to construe the statute and to construe the statute erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.255" offset="12824430">Well, I submit if that argument were presented and accepted by this Court that the exception carved out in the Lawson case, and this came from the Lawson case about the sovereign immunity, would never apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.446" offset="12873122">Every time a government official is brought before the bar of a court on a claim that he has exceeded his statutory authority, he can always reply and I submit, would always be replying in prefect honesty that I believe I have that statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.772" offset="12938428">I mean that's what made the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.703" offset="12946160">I don't think we have disputes in here in which officials come in and say, "Well, I did exceed my statutory authority."</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.825" offset="12974686">He says, "No, I interpret the statute as giving me that authority."</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.342" offset="12992763">And if the Court has stopped at the threshold by that contention, as the Government would say that he has the statutory authority to construe his statutory authority, you never reach the question of whether he has statutory authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.634" offset="13257958">You don't have to construe it but you have to assume it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.724" offset="13274258">On the pleadings, this Court has to assume that we are outside and we are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.942" offset="13299127">The Government says that even if we are exempt and conceding that we are exempt, we can't get declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.396" offset="13332982">I say, you don't have to construe it because that's already conceded for the purposes of this case that we are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.639" offset="13361925">And the Government says that nevertheless, conceding that we are exempt, we're not entitled to relief, that's the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.020" offset="13403408">Secondly, on the constitutional question, it's true, we did not raise a constitutional question originally in our pleadings and we didn't raise it because we felt that alleging that we were exempt from the Act, there was no basis upon which to argue that the Act was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.658" offset="13481984">Now, we do not say as I indicated earlier, but if the Act did cover our activities, we would not be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.279" offset="13504449">However, the subsequent history of this litigation and even more clearly, the testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has shown that as interpreted by the Attorney General, the Act is hopelessly vague and obscure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.537" offset="13565471">And we would suggest and we would be prepared that as a criminal statute, it is unconstitutional because it does not give a fair enough indication of the sanctions and its penalties and the provisions under the theory of the Lanzetti case and it would be unconstitutional on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.277" offset="13652511">Finally, if I may have just one minute and I think the subject is fully covered in my brief and reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.001" offset="13675395">On the general question of sovereign immunity, I think it's important to note and I think this -- I -- we have pointed out, the Court has never applied the sovereign immunity cases doctrine, except in cases involving property or specific performance or funds in the possession of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.994" offset="13755329">But we say that that doctrine, this Court has said it a number of times as in this favor and should not be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.296" offset="13784586">We argue that the Government here is asking the Court to extend it to a new field to which it has never before been implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.492" offset="13817292">Now, we made the flat statement in our brief, in our main brief, that the Court has never applied sovereign immunity except in those limited areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.814" offset="13850624">The Government and I would say in it's -- its brief says, we were wrong and has frequently been so applied and it cited one case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.537" offset="13889494">And that case, really properly analyzed does not involve sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.415" offset="13905063">It involved a completely different doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.139" offset="13915930">It involved the doctrine that where Congress is vested a certain power and administrative authority, there the power of the Secretary of Treasury to set tariff rates and if it has made that unreviewable and has told the courts to stay away, the courts will obey their congressional mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.780" offset="13994506">Now, we do not understand the Government to contend here, that it's not the business of this Court to interpret the Foreign Agents Registration Act, that the Attorney General has the unreviewable discretion to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.535" offset="14049468">All it argues really and it all imposes the sovereign immunity for, is that that must be done in a criminal prosecution, not in a civil prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.351" offset="14088756">And we submit there has been no case, where, if we have shown that the criminal remedy here is not an adequate remedy, where sovereign immunity has acted as a barrier to bringing an action for civil relief, where there is no other adequate judicial remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3770.919" offset="15187048">In our -- in our view, there are two issues presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.699" offset="15206170">One, whether the petitioners have established jurisdiction in equity, that is by showing that they would suffer a reparable harm from a prosecution, on the one hand or on the other, that they would suffer irreparable injury if they chose to comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.385" offset="15280880">The second issue is whether this suit is barred as an unconsented action against the United States, the ground on which the Court of Appeals or Mr. Judge Skelly Wright held that the suit must be dismissed or whether the petitioners have avoided the bar of sovereign immunity by showing that the Act is unconstitutional or that the Attorney General would be acting in excess of his authority, if he determined to bring a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.549" offset="15405537">We believe petitioners must prevail of course, on both issues, if they are to prevail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.827" offset="15434689">Petitioners, in their argument and in brief, state their case on a single proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.675" offset="15462066">That is that there is no available remedy at law by a defense to a criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.640" offset="15489964">They state that the penalties provided by the law are so severe that they cannot seek to test, that they are forced to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.217" offset="15528208">In our view however, their own conduct speaks loudest in answer to their contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.537" offset="15553494">They chose to commence their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.320" offset="15564675">Indeed, they chose to continue their activities as representative of the Republic of Cuba after the Attorney General had requested their registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.258" offset="15604381">In -- equity cannot relieve against these activities which are passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.488" offset="15625279">They've chosen to engage in them and whether the determination of law is made in an equity action or in defense to a criminal prosecution for acts which are already passed, petitioners are subject to the very penalties which they urge this Court to -- to rely upon in taking or holding the jurisdiction of this suit should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="3921.286" offset="15788492">We -- we think that their argument that the penalties are so severe that no one would ever run the risk, would then have more believability to it, if that's a word.</text>

            <text syncTime="3943.793" offset="15878562">I think the -- I -- I think at the outset, it might be helpful to look briefly at the registration statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.942" offset="15919104">It was passed originally in 1938 as a disclosure measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.471" offset="15945226">It -- it was directed as the Court I'm sure recalls, at the secret activities of representatives of Nazi Germany, working in secret, pounding out praise of the New Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.822" offset="16014712">It was directed to force these secret agents out into the open or to have them face the criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.295" offset="16056508">The Court has characterized it in the varied cases, a new type of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.994" offset="16079391">And as it now reads, "It provides that no person shall act as an agent of a foreign principal unless he has filed a registration statement or unless he is exempt."</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.137" offset="16135920">And the law sets forth in detail, Congress has set it froth in the statute, the information to be filed in this registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.745" offset="16170402">There are other requirements, supplementary registration statement, bringing the information up to date, the filing of copies of speeches and other materials which I don't believe that my need go into in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.158" offset="16232051">The failure to comply, as the petitioners have said, is a crime if willful and punishable upon conviction by up to $10,000 fine and five years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.470" offset="16285236">There is no civil test provided for in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.015" offset="16303417">There are however, several specific exemptions from the registration requirements and the other requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.121" offset="16327868">Recognized diplomatic officials need not register, bona fide representatives of religious and scientific organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.020" offset="16359424">There's a further provision that an agent of a foreign government whose defense, the President of the United States has said, is vital to our defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.685" offset="16398085">An agent, when acting in behalf of those defense interests need not register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.324" offset="16424626">And finally, there is the provision under which petitioners claim that they come, 3 (d) and it reads that there is exempted and I'm quoting, "Any person engaging or agree to engage in private and non-political, financial or mercantile activities in furtherance of the bona fide trade or commerce of such foreign principal."</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.737" offset="16534340">I would like to stop here to state that this provision which I've just read, is an amended provision amended in 1961, to eliminate the words or other activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.962" offset="16583241">In other words, it previously read, "Any person engaging or agreeing to engage" -- let -- let me read from the statute quoted on page 3 of the petitioners' brief in this Court because that is how the statute read prior to 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.072" offset="16667669">Well, I don't -- I don't want to spend more than a moment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.305" offset="16680626">It is pertinent to the reliance petitioners place on the hearings of Mr. Arthur Dean.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.335" offset="16704763">The statute previously read as quoted, "Any person engaging or agreeing to engage only in private, non-political, financial, mercantile or other activities in furtherance of bona fide trade or commerce."</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.008" offset="16763382">Now, that was a much broader exemption provision and it was as to that provision that Mr. Arthur Dean was testifying and he made that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.082" offset="16807685">He said that the amendment had removed the words or other activities and it was on those words which the Department of Justice had told some lawyers they were not required to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.399" offset="16857004">I only make the point because the reliant, Mr. Arthur Dean was testifying that some government people had told him that lawyers were not required to register and petitioners have suggested that the law has been administered in the discriminatory manner because they have been asked to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.549" offset="16925550">But I believe if the hearings before the Fulbright Committee will be reviewed, it will be seen that Mr. Dean was referring to the law prior to this amendment, and that Mr. Dean is pretty clear there that as amended, lawyers are required to register and the statute is not a confusing one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.234" offset="17008306">And I might add further that Mr. Fulbright -- Senator Fulbright on whom petitioners also relied because he has stated that there are some confusion or at least a difficult legal problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.829" offset="17054699">Senator Fulbright was referring to amendments which are being proposed so that -- in his testimony in the hearings, at least insofar as there's suggestion of confusing law or inconsistent administration, I don't think it has any bearing on the provision which is being enforced here in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4950.585" offset="19905703">The law specifically provides that this a continuing offense so they are presently subject to as great penalties as they would be by continuing to act without registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.967" offset="19955231">Also, they have referred to the fact that their -- their -- the dispute maybe be settled with finality but the Government has no assurance that this will be settled with finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.333" offset="19996714">If the ruling goes against the petitioners, they say they will register but they may not make an adequate registration and then they will be back and saying that the Government is asking them for something that they're not required by law to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.839" offset="20050735">And we will have more and more cases because every time it will be a question that they face criminal penalties and they have a right to a test.</text>

            <text syncTime="5013.097" offset="20155747">Now, there are many instances in which the citizen must run the risk of a criminal prosecution without an advance statement by a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.792" offset="20218546">For example, the recent case in which the Court denied certiorari of Austin Tobin of the New York Court authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.938" offset="20255117">He was called to produce documents before the Congress of the United States, Committee of Congress, and he took the legal position that the Committee of Congress was exceeding its authority in demanding the documents of the New York Court authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.615" offset="20325857">He refused as a means of testing, his right to -- or the Committee's right to the documents, he had to refuse to produce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.682" offset="20366085">He had to supply on an occasion for prosecution in which he was prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.712" offset="20386252">He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a fine of a $100, as a means of testing whether he had a right to withhold those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.632" offset="20433899">Ultimately, his right was upheld but he was not able to come in and get a declaratory judgment as to whether he had an obligation to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.667" offset="20474023">This question, he did -- Mr. Tobin did not try to do that but there was a suit brought in a previews term by Linus Pauling, who was asked to produce documents by the Senate Internal Security Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.903" offset="20542986">He came into Court and asked that the process of the Internal Security, the subpoena, be declared void as in violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.968" offset="20587290">And he also asked that if the Court held that it had no jurisdiction of a suit against the Internal Security Committee, that it enjoin the U.S. Attorney from prosecuting him, he also sued the U.S. Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.221" offset="20644237">And the District Court dismissed that suit and it held that it had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.580" offset="20665657">The case was taken to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.406" offset="20677047">Judge -- Judge -- Chief Judge Prettyman, Judge Bazelon and Judge Bastian, affirmed the dismissal of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.494" offset="20705364">There was a very limited amount of time and Judge Prettyman wrote a memorandum in which Judge Bastian concurred, Judge Bazelon concurred in the result only.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.292" offset="20752488">But Judge Prettyman, while emphasizing that there was no case or controversy in his view.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.584" offset="20777671">Chief Judge Prettyman also said that declaratory judgment would interfere with the legislative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.413" offset="20805047">It would be a judicial interference with the legislative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.450" offset="20821138">It would impinge on the duties of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.656" offset="20833991">Now, in -- in our view, this type of proceeding here in advance of a decision to prosecute would be an impingement on the functions assigned to the executive, the enforcement of laws which hold criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.001" offset="20891355">Now, this suit would change those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.575" offset="20905671">We would have -- I cannot see a difference between this case and the case of a trade association which as an -- means -- or it's one of its functions, circulates resale prices and is advised by the Department of Justice that that's illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.826" offset="20974634">It will be coming in to -- obtained in a declaratory judgment that it has a legal right to circulate them, or doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.118" offset="21011832">Doctors are not -- are provided with a right to distribute narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.882" offset="21034924">If they do so in the course of their professional practice, why can't doctors, who have a reputation in the community, they would come in and ask the help of a Court in determining what the words "professional practice" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.619" offset="21101798">The -- this case raises the threat of criminal penalties to a -- a key to come in in advance and get the Court to advise as to what -- what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.370" offset="21152893">We don't view that as ever having been the -- the rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.157" offset="21175986">The -- in fact as the original brief of the petitioners was filed, we thought that their main point was that prosecution would be a stigma, a stigma that they did not rely on the existence of penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.118" offset="21235858">However, we answer that saying that in this Court's opinions in Spielman Motor Sales and Douglas v. Jeanette and other cases, it has always been accepted at the one single prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.990" offset="21287372">The stigma of a single prosecution was not a grounds for equity to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.225" offset="21312240">Now, one reference to the point made that if they were to comply with the statute, it would be irreparable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.432" offset="21361142">We set out in our brief the history of 26 years of interpretation and enforcement of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.073" offset="21395623">In that period of time, there had been 16,075 registrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.199" offset="21420178">The history shows that there has only been one prior declaratory judgment action, 10 years ago and it's cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.327" offset="21460720">It was dismissed by Judge Letts.</text>

            <text syncTime="5618.480" offset="22577298">If the opinion of Judge Wright in the Court of Appeals answers the suggestion that this asking for registration is an excessive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.283" offset="22616482">There is just -- there is no limitation on asking for registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.507" offset="22633409">And as the Court of Appeals said, the authority of the Attorney General to prosecute is also in his absolute discretion barring some lack of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.493" offset="22677295">Now -- therefore, we do not believe that there is any basis here for the suggestion that the Attorney General has exceeded any statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.234" offset="22720345">In fact, we cite the -- cite several cases including Larson in which the Court said that the attorney -- that they Government official is empowered to interpret the law and the fact that he may have made an erroneous interpretation does not mean that he's acting in excess of his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.934" offset="22807071">Quoting Larson, it is argued, the Court stated, it is argued that an officer given the power to make decisions is only given the power to make correct decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.549" offset="22853569">If his decisions are not correct, then his action based on those decisions is beyond his authority and not the action of the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.890" offset="22886902">There is no warrant for such a contention in cases in which decisions made by an officer does not relate to the terms of his statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.042" offset="22927548">On our view, that is -- that is this case that the Attorney General has authority to prosecute and he has not, in any sense, exceeded that authority.</text>
