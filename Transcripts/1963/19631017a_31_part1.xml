            <text syncTime="20.594" offset="185762">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.927" offset="211048">This case involves an application for the Court to exercise it supervisory jurisdiction really over the actions of the Districts Courts in applying a fairly new statute which has been referred to as the Federal Sentencing Act of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.789" offset="330480">This particular case involves the right of one individual to appeal and the decision of this Court will determine whether he will have an opportunity to appeal or not, there are other cases that will certainly be governed by this Court's ruling and we have asked the Court to pass upon the single question of what constitutes a final judgment in a criminal proceeding where the Court invokes the authority, given by the new statute, to secure further information as a basis for determining the sentence to be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.390" offset="536952">Of course the usual practice is to permit the defendant to continue at the liberty under the bail, or if he is not under bail and remains in custody, but to pass no final sentence until a probation officer can submit a report for the Court's guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.348" offset="632769">At this point the -- there is no sentence whatsoever imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.802" offset="658578">In the case at bar, I should tell the Court the defendant on trial is a member of the Massachusetts bar, an individual with an outstanding record of service in both World War II and in the Korean conflict and man who experienced some psychiatric difficulty and was at the time this case took place considered to have some psychiatric disability connected with his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.088" offset="803715">He had practiced law and had returned from a Korean war and had gotten into a business of selling scientific instruments to some of the Massachusetts scientific establishments like MIT University and Harvard and some of the government establishments up there.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.856" offset="886784">It developed that the purchasing agent at one of the government installations the Watertown Massachusetts arsenal was being investigated for shortages in the inventory of materials and parts that he was supposed to have on hand and he involved a large number of purchase merchants said that he had never received this merchandise but had simply agreed with these merchants of whom the defendant and petitioner here was one, to submit invoices which he would approve as being correct and he would see that they were paid and then divide the proceeds with these merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.077" offset="1075702">This petitioner pleaded not guilty along with all the others, I beg you pardon.</text>

            <label>Mr. Russell Morton Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="266.790" offset="1170578">I believe that's correct, it was a relatively small amount and the very smallness of the amount is one of the points that would be raised on appeal if we were able to appeal, because evidence was rejected which showed that there would have been no profit at all to this defendant under the circumstances of the small amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.033" offset="1263470">However, in the course of the trial I should tell the Court that this petitioner was the first and only one to be tried under these indictments, there were a number of indictments, because these are all pleaded guilty after he was convicted, he went to trial, pleaded not guilty took the stand in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.765" offset="1366392">There are matters of law that we feel and I personally will represent to the Court that the questions sought to be raised on appeal are of substance and are not frivolous by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.776" offset="1418428">They involve for one thing an instruction of the Court to the jury as to the conclusion I might draw from a reported conversation between an FBI agent and this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.229" offset="1468270">We feel that the Court erroneously instructed the jury as to the deduction I might draw from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.925" offset="1491048">Second there is some serious question about the propriety of submitting the case to the jury on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, particularly in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.583" offset="1549667">Now I am not unaware of our Federal rule that a conviction may stand on that basis, but we seek to raise for the Court's consideration, that is the Court of Appeals' consideration plus we eventually hear the propriety of a conviction which rests upon the particular peculiar circumstances of this case where there was possibly evidence of an exculpatory nature in the possession of the prosecution and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.721" offset="1674219">I simply mention so the Court will feel and realize that there are matters of substance which we seek to raise on the appeal and which we haven't been permitted to present at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.943" offset="1755094">I wouldn't, yes thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.617" offset="1769827">Now the point that I must invite the Court's attention to here is particularly the fact that after the jury had concluded that the defendant was guilty and matter came on for a sentencing, the Court said I have no complete probation report and I don't know what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.640" offset="1901902">At that point we can tell this in the brief they have set forth verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.672" offset="1930010">The defense counsel, a very able and distinguished Boston lawyer presented a physician of the Veterans Administration testify to the psychiatric condition of this defendant to testify that he had been in the Veterans Administration hospital under care and discussed the desirability of continuing treatment without incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.923" offset="2031052">At this point the Court, Judge Floyd, a very distinguished Boston District judge, said he was uncertain as to what to do that he had decided that after some enquiry and this was at a second hearing on sentencing that he would, like to know more about this defendant than he had known up to that time and he was aware that this Federal Sentencing Act authorized him to consult with or secure advise and recommendations from the Director of the Bureau of Prisons here in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.364" offset="2188831">Accordingly he said, he proposed to sentence the defendant under Section 4208(b) of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.694" offset="2218193">Now this statute says if the Court desires more information before determining the sentence to be imposed it may commit the defendant to the custody of the attorney general for a period not to exceed 90 days unless he extends it for another 90 days and at that point the Bureau of Federal Prisons shall report and make its recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.169" offset="2320071">He said I think they have the specialists to help me and I'd like to have their advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.254" offset="2348387">It's very important I think in the context of this case to notice that he addressed himself to the defense counsel at that point and said are you with 4208(b) and the lawyer said, I have just read it, Your Honor, I consider it a commitment for treatment for 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.498" offset="2429367">The Court said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.106" offset="2435845">United States attorney didn't say anything although he was present and it was he who initiated the discussion of 4208(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="591.127" offset="2467924">In other words, what we deduce from this is, no one consider this a disposition of the case, but just a reference to the Bureau of Prisons to get the benefit of the psychiatric studies and evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.054" offset="2519542">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="638.464" offset="2657259">Well I am just wondering whether there is anything in that colloquy with the Judge from which it appears that he had the view that whether he welcomed it or not, but if he went along with it that he could not appeal until after the procedure had been completed.</text>
