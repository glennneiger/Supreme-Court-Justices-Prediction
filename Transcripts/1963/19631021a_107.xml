            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="43.419" offset="277086">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.485" offset="293282">This case is here on certificate from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.894" offset="314911">I shall present the opening argument on behalf of the Untied States and Mr. Leon Jaworski, who was the counsel in the court below by special appointment, will make any rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.825" offset="362663">The question presented is whether the defendants were charged with criminal contempt of court or intentional violation of an order of the Court of Appeals, are entitled to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.078" offset="415640">Defendants claim a jury on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.546" offset="429537">By statute, under the provisions of the United States Code that provides for the trial of certain contempt charges by jury when the contemptuous acts are also crimes, and second by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.075" offset="487633">Our answer to the statutory claim will be that it is effective for two independently sufficient reasons because the statute by its terms is applicable only to contempt to an order of a District Court and this was an order of a Court of Appeals, and second because the statute expressly accepts charges of violation of an order entered in an action maintained by the United States, and this in our view was such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.739" offset="610304">Our answer to the constitutional claim is that the trial of contempt charges by the Court for the charges violation of the Court's order addressed to the -- to a party, has been in the established part of our constitutional law since the founding of republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.751" offset="682402">The legal issues arise because the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor of the State sought to arise -- to have array the whole colloquy of the State against a final adjudication by the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.266" offset="736423">The contempt with which they are charged caused rioting, loss of life and the need for federal troops to uphold the law of the land on the campus of the University of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.920" offset="783026">We're not concerned here with the details of those tragic events, but a careful understanding of the incidents leading up to the entry of the order in precedent and to its violation is essential to understand both how the United States came to seek this order and also why it was entered by a Court of Appeals rather than a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.945" offset="887202">For that reason, I want to take some little time carefully to state the sequence of events leading up to the order.</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="213.403" stopTime="390.098">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="213.403" offset="957001">Because I think I'm concentrating on the facts insofar as they show first, how it came to be that the United States sought this order for violation of which United -- Barnett is charged with contempt and second, how the order it came to be made by a Court of Appeals rather than by a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.991" offset="1039339">I think that both of those becoming important in the discussion of the legal argument, but I shall try to confine myself to the facts so far as a deal with that did not go into the extraneous events.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.355" offset="1088763">In January, 1961, as I have said, James Meredith applied for admission to the University of Mississippi at a term beginning in February.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.546" offset="1129514">In May, after a long delay in getting any answer from the University and a final rejection, he filed a complaint in the District Court alleging that he was the victim of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.508" offset="1177370">The case then wound its way through the courts including a four-month delay by the District Court in acting upon a motion for interlocutory relief, preliminary relief after the hearing on that motion had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.052" offset="1239542">On June 25th, 1962, the Court of Appeals handed down an opinion, finding that Meredith had been the victim of racial discrimination and directing the entry of an injunction requiring the University officials to admit Meredith.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.808" offset="1310595">The mandate issued in due course on the 17th of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.877" offset="1334836">On July 18, Circuit Judge Cameron, who had not been a member of the panel, issued a stay of the mandate that had already in fact gone down.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.338" offset="1376737">The panel of the three judges who had heard the case then invited briefs from the parties on the question of the stay and later filed on July 27 an opinion vacating the order of Judge Cameron.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.059" offset="1435564">The panel also recalled the mandate and amended it to set forth specifically the exact terms of the injunction to be entered by the District Court requiring Meredith's admission to the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.233" offset="1488332">In addition, the Court of Appeals issued its own injunction requiring the trustees and University officials to admit Meredith and to refrain from discrimination and respect to his continued dependence.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.801" offset="1542562">Twice more than Judge Cameron issued a stay and as many times, they were vacated by the panel, but he issued a third stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.206" offset="1576208">The private plaintiff brought the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.194" offset="1592195">Justice Black vacated all the stays and on September 13, 1962, the District Court finally entered an injunction in accordance with the mandate of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="390.098" offset="1663770">Was Mr. Justice Black's order itself in the nature of an injunction?</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="394.397" stopTime="407.971">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="394.397" offset="1681011">It was in -- it was in the nature of an injunction in addition to vacating the stay, good as I recall up until the District Court had entered the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.596" offset="1721762">I don't think it's purported to go beyond that point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="413.480" offset="1757288">I would think not, not only for that reason but probably also because Justice Black's injunction was limited to persons acting in active concert with the named defendants and at least, the contempt -- contemptuous act charged in the eventual citation here were actually could not be said to be an act of concert or participation with the University trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.351" offset="1864808">Indeed, they were designed to support the University trustees from doing what they had agreed to do when the question was brought (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="447.506" offset="1893439">So, I think we would have a very hard time for both reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.978" offset="1915277">I mentioned and wish to emphasize it because events began to move very fast at this point that the full term of the University was to begin on September 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.529" offset="1961462">And since Meredith was a transfer student, that not -- not only was the first day on which he might register but it was the proper day for him to register at the University and begin attending classes a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.201" offset="2012139">On September 16th, Governor Barnett moved to block Meredith's enrollment by issuing a proclamation of interposition characterizing the decree of the federal court as a direct usurpation of power by the Federal Government and directing all State officials to disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.528" offset="2089462">Let me emphasize that this in all subsequent acts of Governor Barnett were not simply defiance by a single individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.928" offset="2123107">It was action by the Governor of a State seeking to nullify the injunction by arraying against the full power of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.613" offset="2157798">The public officials and the police as well as all the members of the party list that he could arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.092" offset="2183711">What had been a private lawsuit up to that point was thus converted into a deliberate challenge to the supremacy of the Constitution and the adjudicatory powers of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.159" offset="2231986">Accordingly, on the 18th of September, the United States applied to the Court of Appeals for an order permitting henceforth to participate in all proceedings in either the District or the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.778" offset="2290500">The Court of Appeals declined to act until it ascertained from the District Judge but the District Judge would not enter the order requested by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.617" offset="2329788">The appellate court then entered an order permitting the United States to participate as it requested in either court and gave it the right to initiate further proceedings, including proceedings through injunctive relief such as might be appropriate in order to preserve the due administration of justice and the integrity of the judicial processes of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.760" offset="3070412">On September 19, that's one day before Barnett was due to register at the University, a state court issued an injunction directing Meredith not to enter and requiring the University officials not to register and enjoining numerous federal officials including those in the Department of Justice and the United States Marshals from doing anything intended to enrolling at the University as a student pursuant to the decrees of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.956" offset="3187231">The federal officials then removed that case in the District Court and asked the District Court to dissolve the injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.160" offset="3320038">On the 20th, in the morning, the United States also applied to the District Court for a temporary restraining order prohibiting Meredith's arrest for a local offense and rejoining the implementation of a state statute just passed which made it a state crime for anyone to enroll Meredith or to attempt to enroll him pursuant to the decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.172" offset="5116008">Now, the incidence of that day formed the basis of the second specific charge of criminal contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.605" offset="5453824">Two later incidents should be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.544" offset="5469497">On October 2nd, Barnett's attorneys appeared back in the Court of Appeals and stated that the Governor was in full compliance with the order of September 25th and intent would comply in the future to the extent of his ability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.657" offset="6641977">The words of the statute that speak only of any person disobeying any decree or command of any District Court of the United States or any court of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.503" offset="6697357">Section 3691 to which Section 402 refers you, provides whenever a contempt charge will consist of willful disobedience of any lawfully writ and so forth, of any District Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.860" offset="6766843">Now, there's no possibility that the use of the words District Court resulted from some inadvertence or mistake of the compilers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.498" offset="6801324">Sections 21 and 22 of the Clayton Act from which they were derived also speak of the -- of the same words of any District Court of the United States in both Sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.332" offset="6852733">Now furthermore, in Section 20 of the Clayton Act, which deals with certain acts that may not be enjoined by federal courts, the term used is any court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.869" offset="6902888">Now, the contrast again emphasizes that it was not inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.560" offset="6925563">And if there were any doubt in few of the words, the legislative history would dispel it represented in Clayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.763" offset="6974464">Let me backup one step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.477" offset="6981256">The early bills proposed by Representative Clayton and this all began with the 1896 presidential campaign applied to all courts of the United States except the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.283" offset="7036531">Then, at the first Congress to pass in 1912, the bill recommended by the Judiciary Committee was limited to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.404" offset="7097031">Now, Representative Clayton explained this on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.722" offset="7110301">He spoke of the criticisms of his earlier bill and showed how they've been meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.169" offset="7132035">He said the next criticism was that it provided for contempt in courts where there were no jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.092" offset="7155754">We answered that by confining the operation of this bill to the Circuit Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.155" offset="7176025">He obviously meant the old Circuit Courts which issued many labor injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.068" offset="7195669">And we exempt its operation in the courts of appellate jurisdiction, and there were similar statements by other members of the Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.951" offset="7239137">In 1912, the Clayton contempt bill passed the House Representatives but it was defeated by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.831" offset="7274663">After the new administration took over, however, the provisions were included in the broader Clayton bill that we now know as the Clayton Antitrust Act and were enacted into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.973" offset="7335267">The Committee Reports at that time expressly refer back to the 1912 bill and indeed they even incorporate the 1912 bill, the reports on the 1912 bill by reference so that there could be no doubt that it was taken with that history in the direct line of dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.919" offset="7427009">Respondent's chief argument, if I understand it, is that the inclusion of the words any court of the District of Columbia somehow show that the words District Court be in Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.033" offset="7499525">Now the argument as I understand it, is that the phrase any court from the District of Columbia includes what is now the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, that they would be entitled to a jury trial, that to deny litigants before other Courts of Appeals, the jury trial required in that Court would deny citizens of other states the privileges available in the District of Columbia and if that would violate Article 3 Section 2 of the Constitution which guarantees the citizens of each state, all the privileges and the immunities of citizens in the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.807" offset="7674650">The obvious defect is that Article 3 Section 2 does not apply to congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.926" offset="7707042">Second defect is that the District of Columbia is probably not a State for the purposes of Article 3 Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.003" offset="7743404">Third, it is rather unlikely that the term any court of the District of Columbia was meant to include more than the nisi prius courts which were not then known as Federal District Court but as municipal courts and as the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1987.652" offset="8053948">I was -- first, I would suggest that there's nothing in the concept of equal protection as read into the Fifth Amendment that requires identical procedures, judicial procedures in the other Federal Districts and Circuits to those required in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.413" offset="8125001">I was trying to suggest in addition, Mr. Justice Stewart, that if there is any constitutional problem, I think there's none, but if there is any constitutional problem, then -- and the Circuit Court was faced with choosing between whether the words District Court mean Circuit Court and choosing whether the term any court of the District of Columbia includes the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, it might well say "No, that usage is broader than what was required" and avoid the constitutional issue in that manner because the legislative history is so (Inaudible) that Congress intended this requirement to apply to courts where there are jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.063" offset="8303574">This was said over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.407" offset="8312978">It was said after this language was put in on the floor of the Senate as well as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.114" offset="8339832">So I don't think it has -- it has to be decided here because there's nothing to the argument on the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.491" offset="8369298">I simply say if I'm wrong as to that, that there are two ways out and I think that every indication would be that the District Court means District Court and that the general term was perhaps a little broader and intended, but I don't think that needs to be resolved now.Defendants also argue that even if Sections 402 and 3691 are not ordinarily applicable to violations of an order of an appellate court, they apply here because the Government could have chosen to prosecute Barnett and Johnson in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.678" offset="8534079">I've already indicated that the Government had no choice in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.186" offset="8552155">In the first place, the Court of Appeals directed the Attorney General to institute prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.490" offset="8573367">Now, this was not something initiated by the Attorney General in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.615" offset="8593847">In the second place, the Courts really had no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.351" offset="8608789">The order which Barnett and Johnson are charged with violating was literally and substantially an order of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.439" offset="8649122">That was the only order specifically addressed to Barnett personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.719" offset="8670229">It was the only order that he clearly disobeyed whereas I've said the other injunctions were not addressed to him and were limited under Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.880" offset="8882866">There's nothing in the certified question the challenges, the propriety of that order and I think also so far as the propriety of entering that order goes, if the question was brought -- that was unanimously settled by the judges in the Court of Appeals when they refused to dissolve it and of course, it was before this Court on a petition for certiorari which this Court denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.742" offset="8978369">Now, that's a part of my answer was -- is that the order was properly made by the Court as a Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.287" offset="9008567">The other part of my answer of course, is that this was the only order addressed to Barnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.894" offset="9030928">Now, I go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.406" offset="9040959">I don't wish to stay on simply having this adjudicated because it seems to us that the Court of Appeals acted with eminent propriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.376" offset="9072828">The Court of Appeals which settled has jurisdiction to entertain ancillary proceeding, bringing in new parties in order to protect and effectuate its mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.761" offset="9122461">Here, I think he could have acted in the first instance as was done in (Inaudible) case years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.276" offset="9148479">Even so, at every possible stage, almost up to the very end, the court below did differ to the District Court, gave it an opportunity to do these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.529" offset="9193514">It acted only when that part either couldn't do anything as during the time of Judge Cameron stayed when there's a practical manner the District Court couldn't be expected to act or after the District Court had been given an opportunity and declined to Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.884" offset="9254954">That was true not only because it couldn't act at the time of Judge Cameron's stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.550" offset="9285569">It was true when the United States applied it for the order of amicus curiae when Judge Brown called the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.156" offset="9315976">It was true and we sought the stays against enforcement of the state statute and against enforcement of the state decree and the court below declined to act promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.257" offset="9356413">It was partly true with respect to the proceedings for civil contempt but not entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.208" offset="9380237">That was the course of the hearing in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.103" offset="9395806">I emphasize again that the University officials agreed to register Meredith on September 25th.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.348" offset="9968724">There had been some discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.039" offset="9975515">No, we have proceedings for contempt of our arguments if I may put it colloquy and that brings me of course to a point which I must cover very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.436" offset="10033089">The second reason that we urge that the defendants are not entitled to a jury under the statute is that the only section has barred too and 3691 carefully accept contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ entered in any suit or action, brought or prosecuted in the name of or on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.144" offset="10159940">The order of September 25th that the defendants violated, was entered we submit in a suit or action brought and prosecuted by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.642" offset="10205915">Let me emphasize first the nature of the proceeding and then come back to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.308" offset="10232560">The United States obtained the order in prosecuting its own independent sovereign interest in the integrity of the processes of constitutional adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.076" offset="10275715">Until mid-September, the case of Meredith against Fair was a private actual order to enforce what Meredith said for his constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.002" offset="10315421">United States didn't participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.515" offset="10321481">We had no statutory authority to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.135" offset="10335901">When Barnett issued his proclamation challenging the adjudicatory powers of the federal court and arrayed against them, everything he could in the State of Mississippi then the entire process of the constitutional adjudication was assaulted and the power of the law was attempting to be settled in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.753" offset="10430360">The interest that we were asserting was the interest, the public interest, the sovereign interest in the advocacy of court decree, in the rule of the law if you will and the power of federal courts to adjudicate constitutional issues had not simply Meredith's private interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.934" offset="10519071">Now, our position before the Court as I said before we think is determined by the operative provisions of the order and that arguments based on the label of amicus curiae are wholly beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.760" offset="10566405">Similarly, we think the debates on Civil Rights Legislation of 1957 are wholly beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.548" offset="10593573">Those debates were concerned with the right of the Attorney General to sue to enforce a private citizen's constitutional right, the kind of right that Meredith was enforcing that he initially brought this action, but that was no longer the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.034" offset="10655535">That right had been finally and conclusively adjudicated that the issue that arose where the United States intervened was the question of the effectiveness of the Court's adjudications and it was that that was challenged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.811" offset="10802657">We were given the right to institute proceedings what we instituted we think, it could be properly labeled a supplementary ancillary -- an independent ancillary action, independent in the sense that it was our action, ancillary in the sense that it was ancillary to the proceeding then in the Court of Appeals and previously in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.199" offset="10900146">And it was described as an ancillary action by the Court of Appeals unanimously and the declining to dissolve the order against Barnett when that question arose later in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.590" offset="10949778">But even if there were doubt about the technical nomenclature, the very words of the statute make it plain that the exceptions concerned with substance, I submit, rather than form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.941" offset="10995127">And certainly this order was in substance entered at the suit of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.771" offset="11014457">The statute has very broad term which is any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of or on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.966" offset="11059284">But the sense as explained in both the House of the Senate was that when the Government goes to court to enforce a public right, the statutory requirement of a jury trial is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.309" offset="11108603">I've quoted from the debates in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.643" offset="11121977">There's no need to take the Court's time to read them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.870" offset="11134830">They do state that it was intended to leave the United States with every power to enforce its judgments and demands that it has not that is before the enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.239" offset="11180283">So, that we think on both -- either ground, this is not a case in which there was a statutory right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.921" offset="11251022">I turn now to the defendant's claim that regardless of the statutes, they have a constitutional right to trial by a jury on the charge of willful defiance of the order and decree of an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.096" offset="11315806">Our first answer is this -- it's except by -- except as change by statute, trial by the Court against the party for violation of a decree directed to it has been part of the fabric of our law throughout the life of the republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.494" offset="11385396">Indeed, it seems to me that if anything can be said to be law in the sense that it binds the Court as well as the litigants is the constitutional power to punish a party for contempt of a decree directed to him without the intervention of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.813" offset="11454673">That principle, as the Court will recall, is expressed in an unbroken line of precedent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.470" offset="11481213">It was specifically adjudicated as recently as Green against the United States where the Court held after full consideration that the Constitution does not require trial by jury for criminal contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.456" offset="11957164">The -- well, I would say that the Court was not there concerned where a party is not only violating a decree of a court addressed to him which constitutes contempt, which is always from a special branch of the law and then I can't believe that it was addressing itself to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.171" offset="12052041">Now, I shall go on in view of one comment Your Honor, you may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.588" offset="12069700">I had to point out that here we were far less concerned with punishment than with future compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.681" offset="12106062">I'd like to defer for just a moment my remarks on that point but I intend to direct myself to it specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.574" offset="12133648">I was seeking to emphasize the extent to which this rule has been part of the fabric of our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.923" offset="12155068">I mentioned the decisions in this Court and I think it consist practices in the lower courts for more than a century and a half. The state courts interestingly enough have followed the same rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.734" offset="12214314">Except this change by statute, I believe that every state court including the Courts of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.026" offset="12243466">All that a court has power to punish a party for contempt to which decrees without the intervention of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.356" offset="12280769">The Congress, the legislative branch has also repeatedly acted upon the view that the Constitution does not require trial by jury in cases of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.266" offset="12324446">That view was implicit in the Judiciary Act of 1789 which was enacted by Congress that contained very many members of the Constitutional Convention and would of course propose the Bill of Rights including the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.500" offset="12385364">The contempt statute was thoroughly discussed and revised in 1831 after the trial competes with the trial of Judge Peck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.309" offset="12416606">Both the debates of the revision proceeded upon the understanding that the courts have power to punish parties for violation of court orders without the intervention of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.958" offset="12463208">Beginning in 1896, there was the continuous debate upon a contempt bill that led up to the enactment of the provisions of the Clayton Act that we've been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.526" offset="12505527">And again, the distinguished constitutional lawyers who took part in that debate accepted the premise that the Constitution does not require a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.888" offset="12542934">Indeed, the issue that they discussed was whether the Constitution permits the jury and of course, it's now settled that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.720" offset="12574281">The Clayton Act proceeds on that view so does the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932 and the debate in the Civil Rights Act to the provisions of the Civil Rights Act enacted in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.018" offset="12623496">Thus, I think I'm amply warranted in saying that the rule for which we contend is deeply woven into the fabric of our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.781" offset="12658500">I submit also with all deference that the issue was not one that requires reexamination, especially not so close on the heels of the decision rendered after full deliberation in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.335" offset="12724746">Unlike a goodly proportion of the cases of which constitutional precedents have been reexamined, there's been no change in the social and economic conditions that give rise to the precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.531" offset="12769468">The old doctrines have not lost their probable meaning in the light of new facts nor has experience demonstrated that the consequences of the doctrine were different that was supposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.325" offset="12816697">The procedure is exactly the same as it's been followed for over a century and its impact on this defendant will be just the same as in all other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.579" offset="12857657">Nor do I think that it can be argued that the rule of constitutional law has had intolerable consequences, were cited to know evidence in increasing resort to the power to prosecute the criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.745" offset="12910320">There's no suggestion of widespread gross abuse of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.862" offset="12926830">The greatest danger misused of the power and to punish criticism of the Court has been confined, has been met by statute and by Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.991" offset="12975313">The use of injunctions in labor disputes was another abuse because it circumvented jury trial and provided a method of private prosecution instead of public prosecution, and that was cured by the Clayton and Norris-La Guardia Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.342" offset="13032782">The existence of such statutes and I would like to stress from this point, also shows that this is an area in which Congress not only has the power to legislate but that it can be expected to legislate effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.934" offset="13091088">For the Court to adhere to the settled law here, would neither progress nor perpetuated justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.169" offset="13120031">Congress moreover could change the law selectively picking and choosing between the different cases but it has done this in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.755" offset="13154408">It chose to bar views of contempt power by providing juries in appropriate cases without interfering by -- with trial by the Court where that form of trial is indispensable to upholding the rule of law and securing compliance with the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.382" offset="13228910">Now, what I have said thus far, of course, argues that Green against the United States is a sound constitutional decision which should not be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.608" offset="13273840">There are three features distinguishing this case with brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.381" offset="13292857">So, that even if that decision were thought to be erroneous, or someone wish to hold the question of it, it would seem to us that still a jury trial in the present case would consistently be refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.921" offset="13347088">In other words, whether dissented of which to reserve judgment, as I say, could still hold that defendants were entitled to a jury trial -- not entitled to a jury trial in the present case at reserved judgment on the case like Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.692" offset="13410095">In the first place, in Green, the contempt was of a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.731" offset="13434337">Here, we deal with a contempt proceeding instituted by the appellate court for violation of its own decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.411" offset="13465057">The dangers of arbitrariness, unconscious prejudice, diversity on the part of any judge, subject these judges are to human limitations are minimized by the participate --participation of at least three and perhaps more judges of an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.862" offset="13546872">Again, requiring a District Court to summon a jury where punishment is necessary to vindicate its process is arguably so close to the normal procedure in the District Court for punishing other offenses of law that the exceptional cases can and therefore should be assimilated to the usual case, but of course with the Court of Appeals, a jury has never been part of its procedure and there's nothing to which to assimilate it either in that court or in the appellate jurisdiction, and not the original jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.135" offset="13707891">The Court of Appeals has no facilities for summoning the juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.770" offset="13722415">The statutes don't provide how it should be frozen or when should it come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.060" offset="13743626">Indeed, the logic of the defendants' argument is that neither a Court of Appeals nor this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction has power to punish for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.248" offset="13792319">If for example according to the logic of their argument, the Chief Justice should make an order staying the execution of a prisoner in the State Capital case and the warden went ahead and executed the prisoner, this Court would have no power to punish the violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3673.242" offset="14796361">Still, from the standpoint of one who rejected that argument or wished to reserve judgment upon it, the quality of the contemptuous conduct in the present case is altogether different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3704.428" offset="14921122">In the present case, Barnett not merely disobeyed the order of the Court of Appeals, he was engaged in a calculated effort to prevent others from complying that he was summoning a whole power of the State to vitiate and set aside the adjudicatory powers of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.537" offset="15005550">His attempt to nullification challenged the power of the Court to act as a Court, it wasn't simply disobedience.</text>

            <text syncTime="3741.406" offset="15068975">So that I assume for a moment that in dealing with simple disobedience to a court order, that because of the ordinary administration of criminal justice, it may be appropriate to provide for the intervention of a jury where that historic power, not only to find facts but to acquit a defendant and disregard of both the law and the fact, exercising an arbitrary power of dispensations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.430" offset="15173047">But in vindicating its authority to adjudicate and bind the parties by a forcible decree, a court should not be left dependent upon the unanimous support of 12 jurors, anyone of whom, if he were in sympathetic to the basic adjudication, could block conviction and best stay in the defendants to nullify the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4099.564" offset="16501635">It's true enough to say that when a defendant is imprisoned, until he signs the deed of returns an heirloom, if there's no punishment that while he's sent to jail coercively, he is not punished because he has the key to the jail in his pocket as we're saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.541" offset="16573524">Whereas if he destroys the heirloom or fails to surrender himself in violation of a decree so far as the decree is spent, then the situation is essentially punishment because future compliance with the decree is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.981" offset="16639248">The distinction is not so simple, where the decree imposes on the defendant a continuing obligation to refrain from unlawful acts that he has committed in the past and may commit again at any time for some period in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.283" offset="16724511">The sheriff, to take an example, who engages in a course of intimidation or coercion, prevents citizens from exercising their constitutional rights say to keep them for registering the vote or to keep pickets and other labor organizers in the company town from exercising the right of free speech, is no threat while he is imprisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.506" offset="16833390">The problem of enforcement arises as soon as he is free unless there is some effective punishment for past violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.805" offset="16870588">In the present case, Barnett could scarcely frustrate the decree while the troops were at the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.716" offset="16898278">The problem that faced the Court of Appeals both when it ordered the Attorney General to institute this proceeding and later was essentially one of restoring the principle of Government according to the laws under normal conditions so that there would be compliance with the adjudicated obligation without the need fore force.</text>

            <text syncTime="4264.305" offset="17160547">Second, Mr. Justice -- second, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I wonder really whether its civil contempt, it was proper to impose imprisonment or a fine or something that took place in the past unless you do something in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.917" offset="17251035">I -- I don't know the thinking of the Court of Appeals but it confronted there and of course the very problem that I say, exist now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.452" offset="17293145">That there is no way here of compelling Barnett to comply with the decree in the future and I emphasize that this is a continuing decree unless there is a power deciding for contempt for each violation as it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.575" offset="17373706">But he could scarcely -- he gave no assurance that he would not resume his prior course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.098" offset="17407770">The events that you referred to with civil contempt led his attorneys one stated in open court, that he would comply with the order insofar as he was able.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.782" offset="17446536">But 10 days later, they retracted that and a little after that, Barnett issued a public statement reserving (Inaudible) himself as Governor, the right to decide whether or not he would comply with the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.907" offset="17498990">The only way that probably still essentially one of compliance and I submit to you that the only way, the only available process for preventing nullification was to -- for the Court to have available power to impose some punishment each time, a subsequent violation occurred and that seems to me what the contempt proceeding looked to.</text>
