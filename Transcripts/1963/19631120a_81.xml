            <text syncTime="228.035" offset="1015515">A motion was then made by the respondent here to quash the service primarily on the ground that the designation of agent was buried in fine print in the lease and secondarily, on the ground that the agent name was unknown to these defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.269" offset="1384469">Now, the parallel drawn by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals was that of Wuchter against Pizzutti, a decision of this Court which rendered invalid a statute of the State of New Jersey involving the service upon the Secretary of State as an agent of motorists using the highways of the State of New Jersey wherein no provision was made or noticed by the Secretary of State upon the proposed defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.505" offset="1545383">And this Court struck down that statute as being violative of Due Process Clause on the ground that not withstanding in that case the Secretary of State did in fact notify the defendant of the service that since the state was imposing an agency upon perspective defendants using their highways it was incumbent upon that state to provide for due notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.147" offset="1667950">And while the courts below recognized the fact that this is a private contract not inhibited by the statute or the constitutional requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments with respect to statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.463" offset="1809220">And these provisions have been sustained by the highest court of the State of New York in the case of Gilbert against Burnstine referred to in my brief, and has been followed by the federal courts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="1926.801" offset="7810591">Now on this particular case, the defendants, of father and son, two very small farmers in some town in Michigan signed this lease on a printed form which I've handed up to the Court and something has been said about the economic status or equality of the of contending parties and the -- the law as it had been said, this particular petitioner is listed on the American Stock Exchange, does business all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.240" offset="8076309">As a printed form of contract, evidently does a tremendous amount of business and to compare what these two little farmers out there and talk about economic equality, I think just isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.730" offset="8170245">Now the type of product here, I think what -- give the Court some idea to what's involved, it appears that these farmers were sold something on the idea where if they purchased this article, it will produce grass, some kind of grass, I'm not a farmer, which will contain the nutrients that would be similar in quality so the nutrients that would be produced in the summer time and thereby enable their cows to give the same, if not greater quantity and quality of milk in the winter times with the summer time and thereby by purchasing this expensive equipment, why they would make money of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.715" offset="8418200">Well, and that was term and not to be the fact, payment was just not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.940" offset="8455084">And we find now that in order to defend this lawsuit, they would have to travel a distance of about 2000 miles in a strange part of the country, to them strange, whereas the plaintiff who sought them out and sought that -- sent this representative there to do business could very easily come out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.107" offset="8599803">They don't have to produce any witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.471" offset="8609207">They've got their contract and institute an action there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.822" offset="8638673">I -- I'm sort of coming into this backwards because this is what had end to -- the argument ended on and I maintain that this is strictly a contract of inherence and not a freely entered into contract at arm's length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.944" offset="8715160">The defendant, rather the petitioner have prepared this contract over God knows how many weeks and months checking, God knows what law and with how many attorneys and finally handed to these people without any attorney and they just signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.860" offset="8814843">And then they come here and they start to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.252" offset="8840338">And therefore, when I first saw this, it was the inequity that struck me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.895" offset="8874924">And I made this motion towards the service and I find that there is a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.204" offset="8924139">I like to speak about the rule because I do not know what may influence the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.590" offset="8945768">And as long as it has mentioned, I will speak about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.304" offset="8968547">I say that this rule -- what it refers to an agent means just that, an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.164" offset="9012015">I maintained that this reported agent is not an agent that had misstated that she's the wife -- pardon me, the sister of the vice president, was my recollection at the time of the argument for this motion in the lower court that it was stated, she was the wife of one of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.208" offset="9120162">And I so set forth and my affidavit had never been challenged until now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.182" offset="9148061">So the farmer never in that regard was not willful, but still the relationship was close enough and I maintain that the type of an agent referred to is an agent in the ordinary sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.684" offset="9242102">An individual appoints an agent and I think we all know what that means without my going into great detail, someone had somebody give that kind of control or at least acts on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.311" offset="9308662">There's been another brief submitted here why, I understand the representatives of the American Bankers Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.309" offset="9336560">I understand they will not argue here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.696" offset="9350144">What the -- they might mention of a -- cite references to the restatement of the law of agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.936" offset="9399150">And they just plot words and then they applied the general statements to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.517" offset="9445439">If the illustrations refer to in the restatement of their agency are read, it becomes very obvious that the reference made to those sections as quoted by the petitioners are not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.030" offset="9531538">The illustrations refer to something entirely different and if I may just quote one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.594" offset="9569782">For example, they point to Section 15 (b) of the restatement of agency and if this setting forth while it states, at least they will -- we comply with it in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.324" offset="9636655">But when one reads the illustration is brought to, one finds the following, (1) P writes A, whose business is purchasing for others telling him to select described goods and ship them at once to P.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.286" offset="9716485">Before answering P's letter, A does as directed charging goods to P.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.364" offset="9764864">A is authorized to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.398" offset="9784926">In all of these illustrations it becomes very obvious that the type of an agent that's referred to is the type of agent we all have in mind in everyday life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.256" offset="9860368">Now, to get to this contract, I had quoted the case of Wuchter against Pizzutti, 276 United States 13 in which this Court held statute of New Jersey unconstitutional because the statute did not direct that notice be sent to the non-resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.463" offset="10025253">And it has now stated that that rule of law would not apply for this case because that's the state and we're individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.233" offset="10080319">Well on the contrary, I think if it applies to a situation of that type, all the more reason why it should apply to a situation of our type because the secretary of a state to serve a process, it's more reasonable to assume that such an official with (Inaudible) process to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.179" offset="10184077">And where an individual is involved, especially in a situation of this type whereas the person relationship -- all the more reason why the Court should hold that such a -- in such a contract that it should be a specific provision requiring that process be forwarded to the defendant because such an individual is less likely and is less responsible than an individual who hold an official office.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.051" offset="13847594">A -- a person should have a right to make a contract but I maintain there's a limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.253" offset="13868387">There's a difference between a freedom to contract and so-called freedom to adhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.696" offset="13902137">If a person adheres to a contract that's already sent before them in fine print with no discussion of any terms, then that's not a freedom of contract, there's been no discussion of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.035" offset="13967548">These are just something that's been handed to them to take it or leave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.358" offset="13988760">And so, it's not a question of a freedom of contract but all involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.938" offset="14015091">If the terms were discussed and arrived at -- at arm's length, that's one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.682" offset="14054066">Or where something is submitted to someone in a fine printed form on the circumstance of this case then I say this is not a question of freedom of contract at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.497" offset="14113311">In fact, it's an abuse of the freedom of contract because if we continue this concept, what effect we will have will eventually be legislation by contract, if we don't have it already in many cases by the so-called large companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.518" offset="14197426">So if we want to keep freedom of contract, we should really keep it in its broad sense where two people sit down and eye now a contract and agree upon the terms and the terms are discussed, not on the so-called form of a contract by adhesion.</text>
