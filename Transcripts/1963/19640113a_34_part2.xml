            <text syncTime="3421.290" offset="13788557">I'm in the laws to understand the position of the Virginia Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.247" offset="13804335">It seems to me that as stated in its brief and as stated on oral argument that the many contradictory aspects have been at the -- the same time urged by the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.138" offset="13851878">This case gets down it seems to me to how this Court and how the Bar would feel about solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.013" offset="13887404">When we first start discussing the subject of solicitation, I think it is important to mention as it is stated in the case of In re Haines in Sixth Federal Supplement 467.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.245" offset="13936306">The fact that somebody says that someone solicits a case is not an end to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.574" offset="13961697">The question always raised in these cases is, is the solicitation unethical, illegal, and unlawful?</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.578" offset="14005687">As the Button case states, was there a malicious purpose in mind -- in the mind of the solicitor?</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.761" offset="14034422">The record in this case is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.769" offset="14042467">There is no such malicious purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.176" offset="14052080">This Union was organized many years ago in 1885 and it was organized for one purpose only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.934" offset="14083114">To tend to the many injuries and deaths suffered by its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.567" offset="14109654">The organization commenced as a Fraternal Insurance Association providing insurance for its members who at that time were unable to obtain insurance from any insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.526" offset="14165452">Throughout its history in its Acts of 1906 and in 1908, and seeing that the original Federal Employers Liability Act become a statute of the United States that has been interested in the injuries and the debts suffered by its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.631" offset="14225847">Today, it seems to me that the question is, "Does this Court recognize the rights of free speech to recommend and refer?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.250" offset="14264404">We have cited in our brief many summaries which have stated that an uncompensation -- uncompensated recommendation and referral has never been held to be a violation of legal ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.443" offset="14313096">We also have in this case the -- the question of the conflicts between the union members and members of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.859" offset="14358758">Many years ago in 1937 for example when Mr. Savage signed his contract which is no longer a contract minding either him or the Brotherhood but has been avoided, has been abrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.266" offset="14408391">The -- the record shows clearly that it was a letter in 1946 which was written to all legal counsel specifically stating that the Brotherhood had no financial interest in the cases that is -- there was end the fee splitting --</text>
