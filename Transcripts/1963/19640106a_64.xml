            <text syncTime="39.024" offset="259427">This is a direct appeal from a dismissal by the District Court of an indictment in two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.086" offset="295685">The unlawful acts alleged in the counts consisted of the forcing by the defendants at gunpoint of the pilot of an airborne aircraft to transport them from the air above Dade County, Florida to the Republic of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.362" offset="388786">Count 1 of the indictment alleged that these Acts were in violation of the Federal Kidnapping Statute, which makes it a crime to transport a person unlawfully seized and held for ransom, reward or otherwise.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Pollak</label>
            <text syncTime="94.539" offset="481573">The date of the alleged Act was April 13, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.779" offset="514487">The Court read the statutory words, ransom or reward or otherwise, to require a wrongful goal of a pecuniary or monetary sort and held that transportation to Cuba was not such a goal and dismissed the count.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.134" offset="595884">The issue presented whether the words for ransom or reward or otherwise, limit the kidnapping statute to a holding for a monetary minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.911" offset="651055">Count 2 alleged that these Acts constituted a violation of the air piracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.996" offset="691388">This statute makes it a crime to seize by force an aircraft in flight in air commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.935" offset="735065">The District Court held that the Cessna airplane that the defendants were alleged to have seized was not an aircraft in flight in air commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.030" offset="775502">It read those words to mean only a commercial airliner which carries passengers or goods for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.997" offset="811342">The issue presented is whether these words, "an aircraft in flight in air commerce" limit the statute to commercial airliners, the seizure of commercial airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.185" offset="864110">I would like first to address myself to the dismissal issue raised by the dismissal of Count 1, the kidnapping count.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.041" offset="895561">And then to turn briefly to the air piracy count.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.098" offset="915728">In 1932, the Congress passed the Federal Kidnapping Statute, it was known as the Lindbergh Law and it made it a crime to transport in interstate commerce a person who had been unlawfully seized and was held for ransom or reward.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.951" offset="1003186">Two years later, the Congress amended the statute to add the words, "making it a crime to transport a person unlawfully seized and held for ransom or reward or otherwise, except in the case of a minor by a parent," made an exception for the seizure or kidnapping of a child by his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.653" offset="1102033">The purpose of these amendments, as stated in the courts of the Committees, the Senate and the House, was to extend the kidnapping statute to persons held not only for reward but for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.009" offset="1179460">One year later, this Court in the case of Gooch versus the United States, had occasioned to study the statute and interpret the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.694" offset="1222196">The court there faced the very issue on which the District Court here dismissed the kidnapping count, that is whether the words for ransom or reward or otherwise reached beyond a pecuniary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.336" offset="1288756">The Acts there alleged in the Gooch case was the holding of a -- of an officer for the purpose of the defendants avoiding or the accused avoiding arrest, holding of an officer to avoid arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.722" offset="1354271">The Court reviewed the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.802" offset="1366601">In fact, substantial body of the history is printed in the footnote of the Court in that opinion and it held that the statute was intended to reach and did reach a holding for any purpose to secure a benefit to the person who did the seizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.844" offset="1442774">It held that the statute was not restricted to a holding for a pecuniary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.892" offset="1470986">We believe that this decision in Gooch establishes the error of the District Court, the statute reaches a holding for any other purpose as the Congress stated and that transportation to Cuba here involved is such a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.169" offset="1544025">Indeed, the appellees concede that the statute reaches beyond the holding for a pecuniary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.020" offset="1579447">At page 9 of their brief and thereby relinquished or moved away from the ground on which the District Court rested its dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.345" offset="1616750">And they argue that the statute reaches only an unlawful seizure, an unlawful holding for an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.295" offset="1660531">The contention is that the purpose of the holding must be due itself unlawful, that is for a purpose of committing a robbery or rape or escaping arrest and that mere one way ticket to Cuba is not an unlawful act, not an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.786" offset="1742555">In our view, the Court's decision in Gooch also answers this contention because at the end of that opinion, the Court there recognized that the Congress had made an exception for the kidnapping by a parent of his child and the Court said that a parent who carried his child away because of the -- because of affection might subject himself to the condemnation of the statute but for this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.946" offset="1855195">And in our view, this is a recognition that an act which in itself that is the gratification of love of a parent for the child, an act not unlawful would be reached by the statute but for this -- this exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.538" offset="4965543">Our first contention is that the appellant's notice of appeal was not filed within the time allowed and that on this basis, this Court should dismiss this appeal even though in -- an order entered at 372 U.S. 963, probable jurisdiction has been previously noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.004" offset="5055404">Now, the only properly appealable order that is before this Court, is the order granting the defendant's motion to dismiss both counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.824" offset="5090617">This order was entered by the Honorable Emett Choate, United States District Judge in the Southern District of Florida on September 17th, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.841" offset="5130742">Now, this is the only appealable order notwithstanding the reference made by the Government in the notice of appeal which purports in addition to this order to also appeal from an order dated November 5, 1962 denying the Government's petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.455" offset="5197197">Surely, there can be no question but that the order denying the petition for rehearing is not itself an appealable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.588" offset="5225723">This appeal, as counsel has pointed out, is only permitted by virtue of 18 U.S. Code 3731 providing for an appeal by the United States from the District Court directly to the Supreme Court on a judgment or decision dismissing an indictment where it's based on the invalidity or construction of a statute upon which the indictment is founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.844" offset="5330735">An appeal from an order denying a petition for rehearing would surely be outside of the scope of 18 U.S. Code 3731.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.766" offset="5370441">"Rule 11.2 of the Supreme Court rules provides that in these cases allowing for a direct appeal, the notice of appeal shall be filed by the Government within 30 days after the entry of the order appealed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.954" offset="5431150">In the instant case, the notice of appeal was not filed until December 5, 1962, some 79 days after the entry of the order appealed from which is the order of dismissal of September 17th, 1962."</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.179" offset="5692061">And it is our position that in -- in this particular situation where the right of appeal is limited by statute, that the rule provides a 30-day period after the entry of the order appealed from and the all that the Government did within that 30-day period was to file a so-called petition for rehearing which is not authorized by statute, by rule or by previous case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.226" offset="5788296">And then we contend of course that even if such a petition for rehearing would be authorized that it most surely does not extend at all or in anyway stay the time for appeal from running.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.763" offset="5874395">Well Your Honor, let us refer if I may to the rules of civil procedure, we have rule 37 (a).2 which sets forth that a defendant is given 10 days to file a motion for new trial and that after this 10-day period runs, after the entry of the order denying the motion, he still has an additional 10-day period within which to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.327" offset="5960704">Then the second provision of this rule says, however, the Government is given 30 days when they can appeal and it does not provide for a similar situation allowing the Government in a criminal case to extend the time by filing a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.679" offset="6022040">Now, the point is that in this rule, a federal rule of criminal procedure, we have a right given to a defendant which is not a corollary right given to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.995" offset="6063313">Now, the only cases relied on by the Government in this instance is that where civil cases specifically by rule provide for petition for rehearings, they can file them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.534" offset="6105527">But there certainly has no provision for a petition for rehearing in the instant case and therefore, if it were filed, it surely should not stay the time for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.079" offset="6143666">Now, this Court, in the case of United States versus Robinson, 361 U.S., 220, has previously held that the rules of criminal procedure as to the filing of a notice of appeal after the expiration of time does not confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeals even though the District Court found in that case that the light -- late filing was excusable neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.877" offset="6238856">The Court points out that to recognize a late notice of appeal is actually to enlarge the period of taking an appeal which is forfeit or otherwise as under the decision of the court below, many appeals might and almost surely would be indefinitely delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.224" offset="6308237">And the Court points out that to avoid this, the question of filing a notice of appeal is jurisdictional and there is no basis for allowing a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.421" offset="6353063">Now, the Government does cite one case in their reply brief which is a criminal case, that is Craig versus the United States reported at 298 U.S. 637, wherein the defendant had filed -- had a petition for rehearing pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals and while this petition for rehearing was pending, he had simultaneously applied to this Court for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.954" offset="6447208">This Court found that the petition was premature because the petition for rehearing had not yet been disposed off by the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.704" offset="6478137">Most assuredly, this situation which is governed by rule allowing for a petition for rehearing in an appellate decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals cannot be extended to give any authority for the type of petition filed here which is a so-called petition for rehearing on the order denying the indictment or the order --</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.088" offset="6635708">It is our position that the rules and statutes governing this appeal are quite clear in their scope that to have properly appealed, the Government should have filed their appeal within 30 days after the entry that the order appealed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.759" offset="6694431">In this instance, it was 79 days after the entry of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.998" offset="6707388">It was, therefore, untimely and this Court should dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.365" offset="6724838">Now, addressing myself to the merits of the case, we have the first issue of whether the Federal Kidnapping Act is applicable to situations where there is an unlawful transportation for a lawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.401" offset="6780949">Now, the Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S.C. 1201, specifically provides and defines kidnapping as knowingly transporting in interstate or foreign commerce any person who has been unlawfully seized or carried away and held for ransom, reward or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.604" offset="6869765">In Count 1 of the indictment, the defendants were charged with an alleged violation of the Federal Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S.C. 1201, by allegedly forcing one Woodruff Mead (ph) at gunpoint and against his will to fly an aircraft that he was then piloting to with a four passengers, Cessna 172 to the Republic of Cuba which was done for the purpose of -- and here is the important provision, for the purpose of transporting the defendants from Dade County, Florida to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.669" offset="6994004">Now, regardless of what counsel states as far as the immigration requirements of the state department, surely there is not in this indictment any indication of any law being broken by flying from Dade County, Florida to the Republic of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.842" offset="7070699">The federal judge dismissed this count of the indictment in his order of September 17th, 1962 based on the courts' construction of the statute, in that he concluded that the facts as alleged do not state an offense under the Federal Kidnapping Act, that there's a failure to allege that Mead (ph) was kidnapped for a purpose within the meaning of ransom, reward or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.225" offset="7172263">Now, the Government has relied heavily on legislative history in the case of Gooch versus the United States, 297 U.S. 124.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.147" offset="7203924">They cite legislative history on page 10 of their brief and they seem to indicate that it was the purpose of the Congress to extend the Act for any purpose -- for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.193" offset="7252093">They even emphasized this statement in their brief and they emphasized the statement in their oral argument for any reason or for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.057" offset="7287620">Now, the early Gooch case seems to bear this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.265" offset="7300472">It seems to indicate that this Court will likewise apply this Kidnapping Act for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.934" offset="7327117">And yet, what do we have after the Gooch case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.895" offset="7338924">We have the case of Chatwin versus the United States, 326 U.S. 455, wherein it was recognized in that case that in the extension or interpretation as the Government would have us extend in the Federal Kidnapping Act was unworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.166" offset="7412067">We have in the Chatwin case a tempering, a more moderate approach notwithstanding legislative intent or history as emphasized by the Government and notwithstanding the ruling in the earlier Gooch case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.781" offset="7462536">It is our contention that the celestial marriage of a Mormon and a 15-year-old girl without her parent's consent in Chatwin versus the United States, 326 U.S. 455 which is quoted extensively on page 9 of our brief, is no less a benefit to that defendant as was the transportation from Florida to Cuba to the defendants who were charged with violation of the Kidnapping Act in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.974" offset="7583222">In the Gooch case, the alleged transportation of police officers was to prevent the arrest of their captives clearly an illegal purpose.In the instant case, there is nothing illegal alleged in being transported from Florida to Cuba as the District Court properly found the facts in the instant case are not within the scope of the Federal Kidnapping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.282" offset="7672456">All of the authority relied on by the Government involves unlawful transportation for the accomplishment of an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.119" offset="7707878">The Federal Kidnapping Act with its severe penalties should not apply where the indictment alleges unlawful transportation for a lawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.270" offset="7748420">That is transportation from Florida to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.718" offset="7762213">Perhaps under these facts, there could be proper offenses alleged such as lesser state offenses or false arrest or false imprisonment but most assuredly, this does not fall within the scope of the Federal Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S. Code 1201 and this --</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.230" offset="8024273">True, there may have been properly alleged an unlawful seizure and true, there may have been properly alleged a transportation in interstate commerce but the purpose of the transportation as alleged in the indictment which was the basis of the Court's dismissal is to transport these people from -- from Florida to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.768" offset="8102431">Now, the Government has contended as they contended in the lower court that this falls within the meaning of ransom, reward or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.815" offset="8138585">We contend that this case -- Court since the Gooch case has recognized that not every unlawful transportation falls within the meaning of the word "otherwise" and that if this were so as this Court has held and has stated in Chatwin versus the United States on page 466.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.372" offset="8212877">This Court stated where we -- this sanction a careless concept of a crime of kidnapping or are we to disregard the background and setting of this Act, the boundaries of potential liability would be lost in infinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.522" offset="8261465">A loose construction of the statutory language conceivably could lead to the punishment of anyone who induced another to leave his surroundings so as to do either an innocent or an illegal act for the benefit of the former state line subsequently being transcribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.536" offset="8325517">The absurdity of such a result with its attendant likelihood of unfair punishment and blackmail is sufficient by itself to foreclose this construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.723" offset="11730213">Now, the Government throughout their brief in their argument would have this Court believe that the statute reads any aircrafts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.000" offset="12067401">Congressional intent indicates that the use of the words "interstate commerce" or "in air commerce" was used that this broad terminology was used in order to cover foreign as well domestic flights which carry large numbers of passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.350" offset="12124766">In the hearings before the House Aviation Subcommittee, representative Chelf said the he -- his Committee hopes to draft legislation that will cover the Cessna Commercial Airline property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.794" offset="12594552">Indeed, the -- in the portion quoted in the appellee's brief, there are some material that's omitted and it reads this adding the material and I'm quoting from page 9 and page 464 of the Supreme Court report 326."</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.416" offset="12681070">The broadness of the statutory language does not permit us to tear the words out of their context using the magic of (Inaudible) to apply them to unattractive or immoral situations lacking and -- " now, I'm inserting the words that were omitted."</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.125" offset="12743868">The involuntariness of seizure and detention which is," and now I'm back at the quote, "the very essence of the crime of kidnapping."</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.002" offset="12783365">In our view, the Chatwin case is fully explainable by the fact that there was not there the involuntariness of seizure and detention which is the essence of kidnapping and which is here, and we -- we think that is the significance of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.826" offset="12854627">And indeed, we do not feel that our case in any way rests on the unlawfulness or lawfulness of a flight to Cuba because we -- we do not believe that there is any basis for the argument that the purpose must be an unlawful one.</text>
