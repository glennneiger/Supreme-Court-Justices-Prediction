            <text syncTime="11.856" offset="153028">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="13.118" offset="158148">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.923" offset="173299">Yesterday, I had outlined our reasons for suggesting that on the merits, this case comes down to the question, whether the per capita inequalities are so severe, so serious in relation to any permissible objective that they might be thought to attain as to constitute a denial of the Equal Protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.116" offset="290118">Let me first say a word about the inequalities themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.407" offset="311225">The basic figures that pertain to the Senate are most conveniently set forth in this case I think in Appendix C to the opinion of the District Court which of course, appears in the back of the jurisdictional statement and they begin on Page 74 run over for a few additional pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.152" offset="402236">We attempted to relate them to geography by this map that I asked the clerk to distribute yesterday, which preserves the numbering of the districts as they are in the opinion of the court below and which shows their size and shape and also the average number of people per senator in each district and the population of each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.714" offset="516548">Finally, it maybe helpful to point out one-third document, then I think Court will know what they all are, in this blue volume, which is the Appellees' Exhibit D, there is a useful topographical map on the inside of the back cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.417" offset="591258">I am not going to ask Your Honors to follow all three at once, but you may find it useful in your study of the case in chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.816" offset="636920">The inequalities run most severely against El Paso County, which appears on our map as Districts 11 and 12 just to the right of the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.385" offset="703167">Now that contains the Colorado Springs area and there you will note that there is one senator for each 71,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.313" offset="746843">At the other extreme is District 23, Las Animas County, which is down on the right bottom of Colorado, a little to the right of the center, where you will note that there is one senator for 19,000, almost 20,000 people, the ratio versus El Paso County being 3.5:1.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.204" offset="842452">As a matter of fact, there are five counties that have more than three times the per capita representation of a person living in El Paso County.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.917" offset="901279">There are three counties that have three times the representation of a person living in Jefferson County which is in the center of the state right next to Denver and which of course, is a suburb of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.706" offset="968466">Denver, the little dot, almost in the middle which we've identified by a line as District 28 has only half the per capita representation of the people in seven counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.953" offset="1049446">The result of these comparisons, and of course, the Court will want to study them is a very striking departure from equality and the principle of majority rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.942" offset="1105452">A numerical majority of the Colorado senate can be elected from counties containing less that one-third of the people of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.907" offset="1157279">Denver and the three adjacent counties, those touching upon it, plus Pueblo, and Colorado Springs have in excess of 63% of the population and less than a majority of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.849" offset="1224989">I would emphasize in addition that these imbalances are getting worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.308" offset="1246827">Of course, the case must be judged as of today, but nevertheless we are dealing as it were with things in motion, like in airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.006" offset="1281622">The imbalance for example on the figures for January 1964 is such that now it takes only a little over 31% of the counties having only a little over 31% of the population to elect a majority of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.846" offset="1345047">Denver and its suburbs today have a majority of the population and only 14 out of 39 senators, hardly more than one-third.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.251" offset="1398651">With that general picture in mind, I turn to the objectives that are said to justify this lack of per capita equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.094" offset="1454030">Some of them as Mr. Creamer pointed out yesterday are plainly impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.103" offset="1478063">They are, if they were the basis of the distinctions alone, one could call them invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.401" offset="1511291">For example, the opinion below seems to adopt the view expressed by the witness Rogers and one of the other witnesses, that voters who lived in heavily populated areas aren't worth as much as voters who live in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.443" offset="1583389">That it seems is clearly an impermissible ground for differentiation as we've argued in the other cases and as we think Gray and Sanders clearly held.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.377" offset="1635111">Again, it seems to us that balancing the economic interests of different parts of the state is a plainly impermissible consideration, for reasons that Mr. Creamer very well stated and that I will attempt to repeat.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.727" offset="1712538">I say just word about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.634" offset="1724136">Appellees say that this is simply a play upon words, that the senators aren't representing economic interest, they are representing people, and of course, that's true, but we submit that they are not entitled to represent people of one economic group, any differently from people of another economic group.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.245" offset="1842628">Would you say that, this is invalid if State of Colorado decided to give farmers, assume they constitute 20% of the population, to give farmers 20 -- as an economic group 20% of the representation in the legislature?</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="496.730" offset="2092567">It was suggested.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="498.242" offset="2098628">Well, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.926" offset="2101345">I spoke too elliptically.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.349" offset="2106987">What I meant to say was that a man because he is a farmer may not be given twice or three times or five times the per capita representation of another man or a woman because she is a suburban householder, anymore than a protestant maybe given more representation than a Jew.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.040" offset="2209805">Now, I would distinguish Mr. Justice White and we'll deal with this in a moment, between putting a legislature together so that there are people familiar with the diverse economic interests of the state and I think that that is a legitimate consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.205" offset="2286501">It's (Inaudible) of people.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="547.302" stopTime="550.056">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="547.302" offset="2294860">So you would permit at least districting to make sure the district is --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="550.056" stopTime="985.740">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="550.056" offset="2305831">Oh yes, oh yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.144" offset="2314190">Not only that but as we tried to suggest in our briefs, we think there are reasons to trying to keep districts small and considerations like that, that cut against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.931" offset="2361315">And so here, we think there have been mentioned a number of considerations that at least do go in the direction of supporting this apportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.433" offset="2423382">If I were stating them I would put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.613" offset="2440101">I'd say that among the permissible objectives are to try and keep the Senate a small enough body to be deliberated.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.859" offset="2477090">Colorado has always had a small senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.822" offset="2488897">That another desirable objective and a permissible one is to have the senators familiar with their districts and the people in the districts are readily familiar with the Senators which requires trying to keep them smaller area and it requires bearing in mind considerations of accessibility which sometimes cause strange shapes in a state like Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.490" offset="2611568">Again, I would argue, if I were supporting with saying what can be said here for their side of the case, that there is something to be said for following county lines because they have some political significance independent of the Senatorial district.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.768" offset="2676665">And that is a fact which we would say maybe taken account of in the districting and which may compel some divergence from strict per capita representation which we assume for the sake of argument to be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.739" offset="2744584">Our difficulty in this case is that when all that has been said, it seems to us that it won't justify the apportionment for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.779" offset="2788783">Mr. Creamer dealt with one of them and I simply refer to what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.192" offset="2814383">We think that the opinion below greatly overemphasizes the problems of accessibility and shape and size, and greatly underemphasizes the importance of being equally represented in the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.404" offset="2875301">Our second objection is that we think the arguments are insufficient here on the whole because all those objectives which we assume to be permissible can be substantially achieved without creating inequalities anywhere nearest areas as those that exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.228" offset="2962550">And we say that to create severe discrimination in a way unnecessary to achieve the only permissible objectives that I've mentioned, plainly unnecessary to achieve it, is arbitrary in this field and capricious and therefore a denial of Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.290" offset="3046768">We suggested two ways in which the objectives could be attained in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.753" offset="3068607">The simpler of the two, I'd like to take just a minute to suggest with the help of a map.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.836" offset="3104969">Down in this very center at the bottom of the map, is District 30 with one Senator for 22,000 and some people, one of the most overrepresented districts in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.283" offset="3170798">Now we can see no reason that that district shouldn't be split along the line of the blue line.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.372" offset="3211131">There can be no topographical objection that follows the ridge of the Sangre de Cristo mountain range until it drops south, it follows county lines, and neither of the resulting districts, 31 or 23 as they are now numbered, taking out the line with the blue Z on it, would be excessive either in population or in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.097" offset="3321994">Indeed there are other districts which are bigger than the other would be and neither would have in access to which (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="812.712" offset="3356476">That would save one Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.304" offset="3366821">We point out second right in the middle of the map, that if the line between districts 24 and 25 were removed and those two were added together, you would have a district with 40,000 people, just a little under the theoretically perfect number for a Senator, the area again would not be the biggest in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.504" offset="3471624">It's a little large but not out of proportion with the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.356" offset="3491059">Communications, judging from the roads and the flow of traffic is quite accessible.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.687" offset="3516345">The difference between the two most distant points is less than the differences than the distances between the two most distant points, and some other counties of equally rough if not rougher terrain and this too seems to be an obvious simple way of less than inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.872" offset="3601087">Now this would free two Senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.952" offset="3617492">If one were given to El Paso County, the people in that county which are now the most underrepresented, instead of having 60%, 63% of what they should have, would have almost the ideal representation, a little under.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.217" offset="3682484">If the other were given to Denver County, the people of Denver County instead of having 73% of what they ought to have would have an excess of 80%.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.795" offset="3724803">Appeelles in their reply brief rather pull this and say well, that's just two senators out of a legislature of in excess of 100 members, I suggest that the proper comparison is with the total size of the senate 39 and that a shift of two senators in A 39-man senate may make a very great difference indeed and this I used to -- I hope I used them fairly bear this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.683" offset="3836398">Instead of having less than a third of the people elective majority of the senate it would take a minimum of 40%, counties having 40% of the people, a much better figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.495" offset="3891673">Denver and the three adjacent counties plus El Peso and Pueblo now have almost 64% of the population and only 18 out of 39 senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.017" offset="3941723">This would give them a majority in the senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.593" offset="3956038">Put still another way are the change of just these two would substantially improve the representation of 37% of the people of Colorado and I submit that it would sacrifice non of the objectives that the appeellees say they're seeking to obtain or certainly not substantially (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="985.266" offset="4046736">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.345" offset="4123013">The important point is that if it is that easy to make so substantial a change in the direction of more equal per capita representation then it shows that these imbalances go way beyond anything that could be deemed reasonably necessary to achieve their objectives and that we submit is arbitrary and capricious in this important area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.253" offset="4230638">Now I would like hurrying on because of the shortage of time to take just a minute on the other issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.710" offset="4272434">We suggested that there is a real question here as to whether the Bill should be dismissed for want of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.457" offset="4299496">We recognize, indeed we urge most strongly that the political picket, the phrase sometimes mentioned in this connection is clearly not a reason alone for dismissing a Bill for want of equity, and that has been clearly decided in the Wesberry case, and we take that as a premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.653" offset="4384238">This case does have some very unusual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.476" offset="4407539">This is not an ancient apportionment as in so many cases; the issue was debated for 10 years in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.331" offset="4442961">This apportionment was approved in each and every county by a majority of the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.273" offset="4470755">And the initiative and referendum are also invoked as a political ribbon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.210" offset="4494474">Now, we'd urge first that the mere fact of majority approved of an apportionment, even a current apportionment is not a reason for dismissing a Bill for want of equity automatically and we have two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.850" offset="4561034">In the first place, the Equal Protection Clause is designed to protect the minorities and to take a case like Baker and Carr or a case like the Virginia case to say that a majority of the people like to discriminate grossly against those who live in Arlington County or the City of Norfolk plainly won't justify it, nor would it justify such a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.075" offset="4665942">And our second reason is that a majority vote to approve a particular apportionment must be looked at, must be scrutinized very carefully, because what may have been done is that the people may simply have thought well, this is an awful lot better than what we had before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.140" offset="4822154">This was a majority vote in each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.228" offset="4838559">Again, I would say that was immaterial in dealing with most individual Constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.640" offset="4864159">Your Honors, heard me discuss on this at some length on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.524" offset="4887774">To translate what I said then to the field of voting, I take it that if a majority of the citizens of Mexican descent voted in Colorado, that no Mexican that should be permitted to have a ballot, that still any individual Mexican who wished to complain could complain, but the right to equal representation is a necessity I think, a shared right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.024" offset="5005743">There is no way and quite some of the people of Denver County, some of the people that the appellants represent can have equal representation without all the people of the constituent units have an equal representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.327" offset="5078990">And I must acknowledge that the result can be said here to be that the plaintiffs, or can be argued to be that the plaintiffs are seeking to force on the class they represent, something that a majority of that class can be argued to have rejected their proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.112" offset="5166135">Now I think it's a little harder than that because it isn't quite fair I think to say here that people of each county rejected equal representation in favor of the present apportionment because there were three differences, Justice Stewart, you'll recall between the plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.157" offset="5254220">One was that difference, another, the second --</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.510" offset="5291732">The second difference is that the Amendment number 7 which gave rise to this plan did lay out the district line so far as the combination of counties were concerned, whereas Amendment number 8, the rival did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.338" offset="5366964">And probably more important than that, Amendment number 7 called for districting within the multi-senator counties and multi-representative counties, whereas this district number 8 called for electing them at large subject to some rather complicated machinery for subsequent districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.244" offset="5462572">So we can't be sure how far the vote especially in the populous counties, turned on one of those other issues and it seems to me that is an important factor to bear in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.740" offset="5512623">One of the other elements entering into the question whether equity should exercise its discretion to dismiss the bail without going farther is the initiative in referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.119" offset="5562151">I would say again that that certainly cannot be regarded as conclusive in all cases for the reasons I stated with reference to the adoption of a form of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.834" offset="5608963">On the other hand, here it is freely available, if those who are complaining not only might get their way by testing this issue, but at least to the minimum, they might show whether it is true or not true that the people of each county like it the way it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.724" offset="5692554">And it seems to me that that is a factor in the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.076" offset="5713975">Whether those are enough to overcome the very real bias pressure to decide cases which is ordinarily the court's duty, seems to me a, so nice a question that we have thought that the final outcome turned on still one other far most consideration and that is the theory and the extent of the harm, that the plaintiffs say, that has been done to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.282" offset="5858798">I emphasize both the theory and the extent, if any, of the harm and we would draw here in our brief, as perhaps the Court will recall, a rather nice distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.273" offset="5922745">We say that to the extent, the plaintiffs have two possible theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.659" offset="5944270">One is the one I've discussed, that although there is some room for deviation per capita apportionment, this is arbitrary and capricious and their second theory is that the per capita is required by the -- per capita equality is required by the Fourteenth Amendment without reference to anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.607" offset="6040087">Their first theory as a theory, we of course, diverged in other cases and we hope that by the time this case is decided, that will be a clearly established Constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.133" offset="6090138">And all it would remain then is the question of degree, the niceness of the question of degree seems to us not a reason sufficient to go ahead and decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.335" offset="6143010">On the other hand, if the plaintiffs can't make the case out on that theory, we think they can, but if the Court should disagree with this, then we would think that any other theory was sufficiently tenuous and any possible remaining harm, damage if any, was not great enough to overbalance the considerations on the other side and so we urge that the Court should decide the case on the merit only because we are convinced that it is made upon the first theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.318" offset="6370902">The Solicitor General yesterday stated that he would argue the merits of the case first, and then would get into the equitable considerations later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.733" offset="6416564">Mr. Hart who will follow me and myself have decided on that same procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.333" offset="6438925">I will argue the merits of Amendment 7 or as we have referred to it in our briefs, and as we may refer to it in our arguments as the Colorado plan, and Mr. Hart will then discuss the equitable features of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.079" offset="6513949">Now, I think perhaps at the very beginning, I would like to clear maybe a misconception with regard to the testimony of Dean Rogers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.663" offset="6556267">It has been stated here and a portion of his testimony has been cited I believe out of context, that the people in the urban areas are not as good as the people in the rural areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.076" offset="6813939">But, he did not base his opinion on the fact that this is a rational plan, because the city voters are better than any other voters, nor did anyone in this case ever take that position, and we certainly do not take it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.458" offset="6871513">As a matter of fact, the position of Dean Rogers is very clearly set forth in the record when he was asked whether or not he has heard all of these various elements that were considered in this testimony that was presented and whether he thought that the apportionment was on a rational basis, and he testified that it was and that's the very basis of his testimony and that is our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.634" offset="6972136">Certainly, we do not take the position that sugar beets or cattle or anything of that kind should be represented, but we do take the position that in a bicameral legislative body that all of the people should be represented not merely the majority or the minority but all of the people in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.140" offset="7066177">Now, people have various interests, and in Colorado ordinarily, the interest of the people depends upon where they live.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.355" offset="7103062">If you live in an agricultural area, your interests are one way, if you live in a dry area where you have no water, then water becomes the lifeblood of that community and that becomes your pre-dominant interest, and if you're in a mining area, the same thing applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.941" offset="7181430">And what we are talking about here, what the witnesses testified too in the court, were not economic matters so much but only insofar as they relate to people, people with their interests, and their hopes and their aspirations, people whose very livelihood depends upon certain legislative problems and the whole purpose of the plan is to have the whole of the state represented, so that the interest of these people maybe properly represented by knowledgeful legislators who are familiar with their problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="4522.009" offset="18193714">There are lots of details and they are confusing at least to me, not as confusing happily as the Georgia School Board case yesterday because they are all in the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.819" offset="18264871">But, referring to yesterday's argument at least, I'd like to make it clear that this Colorado case starts afresh with the constitutional amendment adapted by the people in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.364" offset="18355150">Prior to that time there was a different apportionment system in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.205" offset="18390468">A system based not on per capita ratios, not on -- I mean not on per capita population, but on ratios in which for instance, a district for the senate was given one senator for the first 19000 people and one senator for subsequent 50000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.476" offset="18503526">Each house district was given one member for the first 8000 people and the second member for the first 20500 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.650" offset="18568205">It was this ratio system which Dean Rogers was testifying about which was so called the Elihu Root system advocated by Elihu Root New York Convention of 1894 and it was Elihu Root's theories, not Dean Rogers's theories which he was quoting in support of the New York proposal which was the Colorado law until the people spoke in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.508" offset="18755660">Since 1962, we have had a completely new provision initiated and approved by the people.</text>

            <text syncTime="4695.367" offset="18887108">First, it got rid completely of the ratio principle in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.644" offset="18920231">It provided that a legislature must district the house purely in accordance with population and not in accordance with these ancient ratios.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.084" offset="18973939">Second, it puts sanctions on the house, on the legislature so that they had to comply with this constitutional provision which they had rather avoided in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.117" offset="19050112">It put those sanctions on by providing that if they didn't immediately redistrict the house and if they didn't do so every ten years, they'd lose their pay from then on and they weren't able to be reelected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.572" offset="19111970">They couldn't run for reelection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.482" offset="19123568">That was effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.898" offset="19137256">In the third place, they moved closer to a per capita representation in the senate than they had ever been before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.061" offset="19185844">They added four new senators, those to the four most rapidly growing areas in the state, the suburbs of Denver, giving each of those four counties surrounding Denver two senators in all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.051" offset="19281870">Third or fourth, they provided for sub-districting the multi-senator, multi-representative districts so that the individual voters could know who they were voting for and would be able to choose between two candidates instead of as it was in Denver, 34 candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.783" offset="19416767">The case has been ably argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.971" offset="19441531">We have presented briefs, which I think are good, but the best thing of all in this case is the transcript of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.483" offset="19495552">The evidence here supplied completely by our appellees is from very distinguished and very able men.</text>

            <text syncTime="6532.518" offset="26235666">This Court can overthrow the constitutionality of this plan if it so holds, but the majority vote of the people does, as you well-express, bear on the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.187" offset="26302435">I would say that it bears in four ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.094" offset="26321975">One, the vote of the people are well-informed after an intensive campaign and after ten years of study and debate, after two prior referred measures, certainly indicates their view of the reasonableness of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.314" offset="26434928">In the second place, the existence of the initiative stands like a good angel, shall we say, over the acts of this legislature, who is apportioning your considering, because everything that this legislature does is -- can be subjected to the initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6606.453" offset="26531477">It's the most liberal initiative of any state in the United States, except North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.137" offset="26558226">It's more liberal even then California, in that the number to initiate a measure is 8% of the vote for Secretary of State, which is a small vote, as compared to 8 for Governor, which is a larger vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.267" offset="26630742">In the third place, the presence of the initiative in this case provides a remedy whereby the people at any time they are dissatisfied can come in and change the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="6647.536" offset="26695735">Even this November, there is plenty of time; an initiative doesn't have to be filed until July 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.560" offset="26739934">Four months before the election appellants can go in there with any plan they want, put it up to the people, and the people can vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6668.860" offset="26781103">That is Mr. Cox's point when he says that there is no need for equity to intervene here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6680.033" offset="26825825">In the third place, there is the matter of integrity of the vote, but this whole series of cases, beginning with Baker against Carr, proves is -- or is aiming at, is the right to vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="6703.580" offset="26919970">Thank you!</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.365" offset="26927075">Continuing, I would like to turn afresh to the plan proposed by the Solicitor General and outlined in blue on the map which he furnished you, as being an alternative to the plan adopted by the people, and of course in addition to the fact that this is his plan, revised in Washington, 2,000 miles from Denver, as opposed to the plan adopted by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.707" offset="27064479">I would like to point out, not just the inconsistencies in the plan, which I tried to develop with respect to Huerfano County and Canyon City, but also the fact that it doesn't achieve, to any substantial degree, any improvement in what he would consider the discrepancies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.860" offset="27173044">He argues now that 33.2 of the people can elect a majority of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6774.266" offset="27202719">Under his plan 39% of the people could elect the majority of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6780.968" offset="27229469">The ratio of the least populous district under our plan to the most populous would be 3.6:1; under his it would be 3.3:1.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.799" offset="27284848">It would change only 2% of the seats in the whole legislature, 2 out of 104, or in the Senate itself, it would change only 5% of the seats in the Senate, just over, 2 out of 39.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.127" offset="27362171">We feel that this is de minimis and not substantial enough to upset the vote of the people of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.047" offset="27417864">I would like in the same vein to refer to some other statistics, the ratios of population to Senators under the Colorado Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.297" offset="27498843">There may be the impression before the Court, and I think Mr. Justice Goldberg had that impression, that the Colorado Plan gives control to the rural areas; it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6864.213" offset="27562478">There are four different areas in the state; the Western, the Eastern, the South Central, and the Eastern slope.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.000" offset="27617648">The Eastern slope is the metropolitan area involved in any discrimination, if there were one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6887.980" offset="27657563">Under the Colorado Plan, the eastern Slope has 75% of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.089" offset="27682014">It would have 23 Senators as against 15 Senators for the rest of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6904.394" offset="27723183">It would have 47 Senators as against 26 -- 47 members of the House as against 26 for the rest of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.950" offset="27793400">Even the three metropolitan areas of Colorado Springs, Denver, and Pueblo, would still have 42 out of 63 in the House and 20 out of 39 in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6943.231" offset="27878559">The three metropolitan areas, excluding the rest of the urban Eastern slope, would still control both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.361" offset="27919101">If you take urban areas as a whole as against rural areas, and there are urban areas in other parts of the state, senatorial districts electing -- representing predominantly urban population would have 24 Senators as against 15 Senators from districts representing predominantly rural populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6992.451" offset="28075418">One other point with respect to Mr. Goldberg's question, we are not here concerned with property rights or with discrimination against religious groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.100" offset="28118050">We are here concerned with the right to vote, and with respect to the right to vote, I submit that the vote of the people is peculiarly persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7019.405" offset="28183252">The vote of the people in the very districts involved in any alleged discrimination should be given, particularly weight in this instance, and I quote from the Solicitor's brief on Page 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="7034.986" offset="28245632">“Any relief granted to those who requested in the courts will unavoidably be forced upon those who rejected it at the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="7044.811" offset="28284920">Under such circumstances the will of those similarly situated and necessarily affected, which seemed to be a factor, that equity should take into account in deciding whether to intervene or to stay its hand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7061.615" offset="28352107">I say more than in just deciding whether to intervene or to stay its hand, it should be taken into consideration in considering whether or not this is rational or whether or not it's invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="7078.087" offset="28418040">I might also mention that the relief which the people of the State of Maryland, in the case that you heard in November, which they asked for is exactly the relief which the people of Colorado have already exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.863" offset="28529113">In the Maryland case, the petitioners in that case, the complainants, asked that the court enjoin the defendants from performing their election duties until such time as the General Assembly should submit for referendum vote by eligible state voters an amendment to their constitution which would reapportion the membership of the General Assembly on the basis of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.503" offset="28651679">That's exactly the referendum which was submitted to the people in Colorado and exactly what they turned down in favor of this plan, which was submitted at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7152.605" offset="28716045">In conclusion, I would like to state what I was about to say just before the intermission, that with the case of Baker against Carr, this court initiated a very far-reaching inquiry into the problem of the right to vote for state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="7185.983" offset="28849583">That case was a milestone in the protection of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="7193.592" offset="28879990">Both the briefs of the appellants and of the Solicitor General are paeans of praise in favor of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="7207.859" offset="28937041">Here we have a plan which is the result of that vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="7215.851" offset="28969015">It's the result of a vote statewide in which every man had an equal vote and it can be broken down by counties, and in ever county a man had an equal vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="7232.757" offset="29036620">We submit that the protection of the right to vote is of very little avail if the integrity of the vote, where no discrimination against the minority is involved, is abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="7252.029" offset="29113733">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="7278.082" offset="29218014">I have listened with interest to the various arguments presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="7287.745" offset="29256571">While reference has been made to the plan advocated by our opposition and the plan of the Solicitor General, that to me is not the choice here to be made, the choice is a plan compatible with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7316.315" offset="29370883">The plan here to be tested falls short of any constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="7327.800" offset="29416858">Constitution tries to give weight and your decisions have tried to give weight of equal value to all voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7344.465" offset="29483523">That's a very vital and important right.</text>
            <text syncTime="7349.717" offset="29504525">It's not dependent upon discrimination, directed at any group.</text>
            <text syncTime="7357.387" offset="29535141">It's never to give a same weight to the vote of each citizen, upon every issue involving the Federal Constitution, most certainly, and extending to the question of state rights also.</text>
            <text syncTime="7382.688" offset="29636391">Gauged by that test, there is an admitted failure in the State of Colorado to any measure abide by the requirements of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7403.682" offset="29720401">We have a lot of language purporting to justify that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7413.500" offset="29759689">In one case, it's impoverished territory, coal mining sections that have been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7422.429" offset="29795320">In another case it's the fact that some other interest must be represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="7429.528" offset="29823741">Now, it's rather silly to me to content, for one to do justice to another or to another's interest in the legislature he must come from that neck of the wood from which the other lives.</text>

            <text syncTime="7473.287" offset="29998762">Well, I certainly wouldn't want to do discourtesy to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7482.182" offset="30034393">I would assume that Court's knowledge of varying interests of the people of country is not determined upon the basis of the judgment acquired in any given territory or amongst any given group.</text>
            <text syncTime="7506.613" offset="30132091">I am sure that that is not the basis for your considered debate on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7517.628" offset="30176185">Our communications are not so limited that one living in New York is not conversant of the needs of Colorado, nor for that matter are our view is so limited by environment or habitation that we are not conversant with the needs of the world today.</text>
            <text syncTime="7546.527" offset="30291751">So I say it's putting a rather narrower limitation upon the ability of a legislature to function in the interests of all its people, because they are not divided upon the basis of respective trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="7567.801" offset="30376806">I think that question was suggested by Honorable Justice Goldberg in one of his questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7576.588" offset="30412019">Is a legislature made up of urban individuals who ignore the rights of their neighbor who happens to be located in the farming community?</text>
