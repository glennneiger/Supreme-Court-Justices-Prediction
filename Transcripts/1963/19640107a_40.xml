            <text syncTime="13.911" offset="161061">Judge Pierce and I represent the four individual petitioners in this case which is a companion case to the one that was argued yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.057" offset="205678">And if the Court will permit us, we would like to divide our time as far as the argument is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.072" offset="237756">The courts of Alabama could have decreed that these four individual petitioners too, should be punished in a civil libel action.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.512" offset="279448">No actual or special damages were awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.060" offset="297629">The trial court in charging the jury, merely said that punitive damages means such damages as are given as a kind of punishment to a defendant with the view to preventing similar wrongs in the future and that falsity and malice are presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.167" offset="378086">The jury responded by awarding a $500,000 punitive damages against these individual petitioners which was the largest such judgment in the history of Alabama up to that time.</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Rogers</label>
            <text syncTime="104.218" offset="522282">I think it's interesting in that connection Your -- Your Honor that the largest fine that could've been imposed in a criminal libel action in the State of Alabama would have been $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.925" offset="561152">Now, what did -- what did these petitioners do to deserve this punishment?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.603" offset="583826">A precise recital of the evidence brings into sharp focus the petitioners' constitutional rights have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.930" offset="621129">The petitioners are not in truth being punished for what they did or failed to do in this case or what they said and did elsewhere and who they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.148" offset="670030">That the central fact of this case is that they are being -- drastically punished because they were Negroes residing in Alabama, who've had the courage to speak out in the struggle to -- to achieve the rights guaranteed by the Constitution for all citizens regardless of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.666" offset="752055">Indeed, these petitioners, Dr. King and these four petitioners are the leaders of the civil rights movement in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.008" offset="793433">What was the proof in the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="176.201" offset="810256">In the testimony offered by the plaintiff, there were only two brief references to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.041" offset="837632">The first was that their names appeared in the advertisement as published by the New York Times in March 29th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.247" offset="878383">The second was that a few days before this suit was started, each received identical letters from the plaintiff demanding that they publish a retraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.254" offset="922478">There was no evidence that the petitioner's authorized the use of their names in the advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.123" offset="957900">There was no evidence that they were members of the group or committee that inserted the advertisement in the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.226" offset="986321">And there was no evidence that they had any knowledge of the advertisement at all that appeared in the New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.000" offset="1009413">That's all there was to the plaintiffs' case, no other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.987" offset="1033341">The defendants then proceeded to show that the total failure of proof by the plaintiff was not a mere oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.415" offset="1063121">Mr. John Murray who is a volunteer worker for the Committee to defend Martin Luther King in the struggle for freedom in the South testified that on or about March 25th, 1960, he took the draft to the advertisement in question to New York Times and gave it to a Mr. Aronson, who was an employee of the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.880" offset="1140966">Mr. Murray testified that in addition to the proposed advertisement with the names of a large group of individuals and a letter from A. Philip Randolph, saying that those persons were signed members of the Committee endorsed the advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.317" offset="1198644">Mr. Murray and Mr. Aronson, who were the two people who would know both testified at the trial and each testified that the names of these four petitioners were not on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.396" offset="1254964">Mr. Murray further testified that the Executive Director of the Committee, a Mr. Rustin, some time later after the original advertisement had been submitted to the paper, decided that he wanted some prominent names from the South to be included among the sponsors.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.594" offset="1319748">So he proceeded to add to the original list submitted to New York Times, some names from a list he had in his desk of persons who belonged to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an entirely separate organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.212" offset="1378262">Now, because he was anxious to get the advertisement published, he decided not to take the time to ask the individuals for permission to use their names.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.337" offset="1422775">All of the petitioners testified, each as a spiritual and religious leader of his people.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.293" offset="1450569">All have been active in the cause for civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.592" offset="1467810">Each testified though that he had not been and was not a member of the Committee to defend Martin Luther King.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.926" offset="1501142">Non-authorized publication of the advertisement that appeared over New York Times or had any knowledge of the advertisement prior to its publication, the cross examination was brief and nothing was to develop -- was developed to cast any doubt on the accuracy of the testimony of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.644" offset="1580032">Why then, it might be asked, was such harsh punishment imposed?</text>
            <text syncTime="376.933" offset="1613155">It is stated that it is because the petitioners somehow ratified the publication of the advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.801" offset="1656623">After the publication of this advertisement, there was considerable publicity about it in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.352" offset="1682850">It was finally decided that several lawsuits should be commenced by certain state officials but there was a difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.480" offset="1719317">Respondent and others like him obviously had no actual or special damages and a mere technical victory would have not have served their basic purpose of the litigation which was to intimidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.519" offset="1771457">So how could they accomplish the end that they sought whether it was decided to base the lawsuits on Title 7, Section 914 of the Code of Alabama which provides that a public official in order to recover punitive damages must make a written demand on the person who published the material demanding a public retraction five days before bringing a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.953" offset="1861214">So few days before starting this lawsuit, the plaintiff wrote a letter to each petitioners demanding a retraction of the fall -- false and defamatory matter published by you in the New York Times on March 29th in this prominent public manner as the original publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.247" offset="1950448">Parenthetically, the letter only set forth two paragraphs from the advertisement and these were out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.280" offset="1978556">Petitioner according to the testimony never saw the advertisement until the lawsuit was started.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.025" offset="2009485">Now, none of these petitioners, after they received this letter and during a few days before the suit was started, answered the letter or attempted to place an advertisement in the New York Times saying that they had nothing to do with the original advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.990" offset="2081374">This is the -- the basis, the sole basis for the claim of ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.029" offset="2113557">What did the petitioner say about it when they were asked?</text>
            <text syncTime="506.216" offset="2130275">Well, Reverend Seay was asked why he did not reply to the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.446" offset="2143232">He testified, and this on page 789 of the record, "Well in the first place, I was so amazed about the complaint and about the ad that I was afraid to make any reply to it until I had some legal advice for fear I might incriminate myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.843" offset="2208747">I had no knowledge of it whatsoever."</text>
            <text syncTime="529.206" offset="2222226">When Reverend Shuttlesworth, page 789 of the record, was asked why he did not reply to the letter, he said, "I had not written anything to be retracted as the letter demanded and neither had I seen a material which the letter call upon me to retract."</text>
            <text syncTime="546.345" offset="2290772">When Reverend Abernathy was asked why he did not make a retraction, he replied, "Well, I didn't make a retraction number 1 because I did not publish the ad and I felt that I was being asked to retract something that I did not put forth."</text>
            <text syncTime="560.564" offset="2347719">Reverend Lowery, who -- page 802 and it's interesting I think, in this case that he didn't receive the letter demanding retraction until after the complaint had been receipt -- had been -- had been served on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.560" offset="2415637">When he was asked the question he said, "As I recall, the letter didn't for a reply, it asked me to republish a retraction of equal size or something like that to an ad that -- that appeared in New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.442" offset="2455239">I had no knowledge of the ad and so I could make no retraction."</text>
            <text syncTime="593.484" offset="2479376">Of course, the claim of ratification is auspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.221" offset="2494318">Petitioners were under no obligation either in law or as a matter common sense to publish or retraction in the New York Times as demanded by the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.929" offset="2537159">The statute which -- which is relied on by the respondent refers only to publishers of the alleged libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.719" offset="2564326">It does not require persons who did not publish a libel to retract it.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.137" offset="2581985">In fact, the letter from the plaintiff recognizes this and demands retraction of the defamatory matter published by you.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.378" offset="2614899">It did not say, retracted defamatory matter -- I warn you whether published by you or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.093" offset="2641753">Counsel for respondent now says, that it was the petitioners' silence, not their failure to retract for which they're being punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.001" offset="2685430">But certainly, the letter from the respondent did not call upon the petitioners to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.932" offset="2705178">It did not ask for a reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.603" offset="2715836">It demanded a retraction in the New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.803" offset="2728584">In fact, I think it's interesting to notice that the letter which is really the basis of this whole lawsuit was -- gave every indication of being a "trick and device" because it was dated March 8, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.658" offset="2796084">And it referred to something that -- that appeared in the New York Times on March 29th, 1960 so that the petitioners in reading the letter quite nastily would have thought it was a trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.605" offset="2847807">It was dated March 8 referring to an advertisement that appeared in the letter that's set on March 29.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.420" offset="3399095">Now, notwithstanding this -- notwithstanding the fact that there was no evidence against these petitioners and they'll -- that the law of Alabama makes it clear that silence cannot be construed as -- as ratification of a tort committed by another who is totally unconnected with the person concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.882" offset="3472969">The Courts of Alabama have found a judgment of $500,000 against these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.486" offset="3507346">Such a basis for imposing liability is utterly without foundation in law or reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.364" offset="3534827">I believe that any fair reading of the record causes one to reach the conclusion that this case represents a perversion of the judicial process with no evidence to support the verdict and the case has it -- as its purpose the intimidation of these petitioners and others like them who speak off for equality and justice for the Negro in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.906" offset="3641093">This Court said in (Inaudible) that it retains the authority to nullify action when it encroaches on freedom of utterance under the guise of punishing libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.779" offset="3692502">The Court held in Garner and Thompson that when the record contains no evidence to support a finding that the petitioners' rights of due process of law have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.187" offset="3738164">Now that is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.333" offset="3754778">And we contend that the petitioners' rights of due process have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.711" offset="3776303">But this case is much more significant than merely a case where there's no evidence to support a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.847" offset="3804829">It is clear that this case is a direct attack too on the constitutionally protected rights set forth in the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.724" offset="3840355">Without attempting to repeat the arguments made yesterday, or the arguments made in the amicus brief of the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune, we merely submit, one That a fair reading of the advertisement discloses simply an attempt to speak up on a crucial public issue, not an attack on any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.147" offset="3945994">And two That freedom to criticize and comment in good faith upon the conduct in office of public officials even if overstated and exaggerated is constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.749" offset="4000434">Otherwise as the Court points in the Farmers Union case, all remarks even faintly objectionable, would be excluded out of an excess of caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.696" offset="4044215">A newspaper, however carefully it may be run cannot possibly check on every detail and every statement that is made on the great public issues of our time.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.348" offset="4086847">And public officials, I have to think quite naturally that the arguments of -- and the statements of those who oppose them are misleading and defamatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.313" offset="4126657">The punitive procedures such as were used in this -- in the related cases were readily available to public officials, it would present a most serious threat to a free press, possibly, the most serious threat to free press in this country during this century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.605" offset="4207846">If this case should stand, many newspapers, magazines, radio and television networks I believe, would have to give very serious consideration to limiting their circulation or coverage to certain states, otherwise they could well be destroyed or severely damaged by a flood of punitive litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.201" offset="4298230">And of course, it goes without saying that such a result would be most destructive to our national interest particularly if it resulted in stifling public discussions on issues such as civil rights and the other great issues of our time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.521" offset="4359461">This case is not merely a case of denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.331" offset="4386732">This case represents a federal attack under the guise of a civil libel action on freedom of the press as represented here by the New York Times yesterday and freedom of speech and assembly as represented by Reverend Abernathy, Shuttlesworth, Seay and Lowery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.252" offset="4466458">It is the violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.067" offset="4493730">I like to say in closing my remarks that three of these petitioners have had their automobiles seized and sold at public auction, sheriff sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1303.950" offset="5321185">A present litigation is but one of several libel suits instituted by a number of state and local officials in Alabama on the basis of an advertisement which appeared in the New York Times on March 29th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.175" offset="5382102">The sole purpose of this litigation is to suppress and punish expressions of support for the course of racial equality and to try to keep those who are actively engaged in their fight for civil rights, such as the petitioners in this case from continuing to participate in that stroke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.138" offset="5457962">It is the petitioners' contention that the injustice of this action which encroaches on freedom of speech under the guise of punishing for libel is magnified by the fact that the petitioners fail to receive a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.303" offset="5522641">This trial was conducted in an atmosphere of racial bias, passion and hostile community pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.788" offset="5560571">The atmosphere under which this trial was conducted is quickly sensed by bruising the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.737" offset="5592336">One has only to thumb through this record to find a number of interesting things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.506" offset="5627444">One, you'll find that the record makes reference to Mr. M.R. Nachman, Jr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.911" offset="5653044">To Mr. Embry, but when to get to the lawyers for the petitioners who happened to be Negroes, they are referred to as Lawyer Gray and Lawyer Crawford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.804" offset="5696616">I think it's a shame in this day in time for a record to come up to this great Court where so many pronouncements of equality and freedom have been made particularly in recent years, had to have a record of this kind before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.590" offset="5751787">To be sure it is done by the stenographer, but the stenographer I think generally speaking reflects the attitude and the demeanor of the court and the customs and the usages of what goes on in a place where the court is located.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.208" offset="5990233">And on one occasion, one of the plaintiff -- one of the counsels for the plaintiffs mispronounced the word Negro as Niger and went in a subsequent colloquy with the judge, he said that's the way he'd been pronouncing it all of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.665" offset="6084065">Now, also in final argument to the jury, plaintiff's counsel made a highly prejudicial, I think, race-baiting remarks to the jury which should have been censored by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.975" offset="6137354">And I quote, "In other words, all of these things that happened did not happen in Russia where the police ran everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.475" offset="6167343">They did not happen in the Congo where they are still -- where they still eat them, they happened in Montgomery, Alabama, a law abiding community".</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.354" offset="6206840">Now, I think when the Court thinks that this remark was made about the time when there was a great deal of civil strife in the Congo and there was a great deal of public statements made in newspaper articles printed about that civil strife and about how the Congolese mistreated Whites, raped and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.178" offset="6298164">The intensity of that remark can be felt here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.117" offset="6329929">Now, it is difficult to see how there can be equal protection under the laws and due process in a court where there's not even equality of courtesy or recognition of human dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.553" offset="6395653">Now, I'd like to talk for just a few minutes about the presiding judge of that trial, Judge Walter B. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.373" offset="6434941">Now, Judge Jones in a companion case, as I said before this -- there are -- this case is but one of several pieces of litigation arising out of the same set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.266" offset="6478514">And James B.

            <text syncTime="2129.291" offset="8622540">After these motions for a new trial were made and they were made timely within the 30 day period, the petitioners appeared in court on December 16th and all the parties to the lawsuit, at least the times and the petitioners, they wanted to get a long adjournment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.948" offset="8713237">Under the Alabama law, you can only adjourn a motion for new trial for 30 days at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.436" offset="8743121">So these petitioners or attorneys for the petitioners, they said, well (Inaudible) -- they thought that as the New York Times was going to come in and adjourn the motion until it was heard, they would not have to appear in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.476" offset="8799336">And they did not appear in court until it was time to argue and that was March 3rd, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.955" offset="8821279">And when they walked into the Court on March 3rd to argue this case, the judge refused to hear argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.709" offset="8852208">He said that the motions had lapsed, that -- that they did not appear at the time they were adjourned and therefore they had lapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.229" offset="8894318">Now, there are no cases in Alabama precisely on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.338" offset="8910723">The respondent cites none and we were unable to find any in our search of the Alabama cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.635" offset="8943950">The respondent does cite cases on lapsed motions but this involved an individual plaintiff or defendant who was allowed a motion to lapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.896" offset="8988985">They did not involve as here two or more plaintiffs or defendants who had each made a motion for a new trial and one had appeared to adjourn the hearing of the motion and the other had not and the court then decided on the day of the argument that the party who had failed to appear on a date, the matter was adjourned could not argue because he allowed it to lapse, announced precisely on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.871" offset="9128897">I'd -- I would go further here Your Honors and say that state judges have an obligation to protect fundamental constitutional rights of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.023" offset="9169544">As this -- as this court had said as far back is Gibson versus Mississippi in 1895, "Upon the state courts equally with courts of the union rest, the obligation to God, enforce and protect every right guaranteed or secured by the Constitution of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.372" offset="9250941">More recently, in Johnson versus Virginia, this Court stated that the state has a duty to deny no one equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.774" offset="9284483">I think that the action of the judge here was arbitrary, whimsical and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.361" offset="9314889">And for that reason alone, can be set aside and the objections that are raised can be looked at by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.665" offset="9348117">Moreover, this Court has held that alleged violations of fundamental constitutional rights when plainly and reasonably made, are not to be defeated under the name local practice and such violations are reviewable by this Court even if they were not raised strictly in accordance with local forms of practice and procedure and -- procedural technicalities.</text>

            <text syncTime="6447.223" offset="25894285">What if he -- if he doesn't rely in the statute as soon as they were served with the complaint, they said they did not authorize it then they -- they all gave depositions and then new depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6455.755" offset="25928453">They said they did not authorize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6457.118" offset="25933887">They didn't even know anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.362" offset="25942873">So very quickly after they received the letters, they made it perfectly clear to the public and to Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Nachman that they had no connection at all with this advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6470.441" offset="25987176">So that the arguments he makes -- well, interesting, really are -- I think designed to deceive the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.261" offset="26026465">The fact of the matter is these petitioners are here today because they're Negroes and because they've been leaders in the fight for civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6488.501" offset="26059379">That's all there is to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.788" offset="26068574">Now, he -- when -- when Justice Goldberg asked him about the cases in -- in Alabama which he relied, it seemed to me he -- he didn't answer that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6505.289" offset="26126566">The fact of the matter is there are three cases, Burns against Campbell, which is 71 Alabama 271, Belcher Lumber against York, and there's Fidelity &amp; Casulty against Beeland.</text>
            <text syncTime="6520.560" offset="26187692">Now, in every one of those cases, it's made perfectly clear that the law is that in a tort case, mere silence does not make you guilty of a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="6529.510" offset="26223428">There is no case in Alabama that suggest that and Mr. Nachman didn't really -- he just -- adopt the issue when you asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.836" offset="26252790">The fact of the matter is in that -- in the -- in the Beeland case, the Court said that a man cannot make evidence for himself by writing a letter containing the statement he wishes to prove and then claim failure to answer as omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6552.588" offset="26315797">That's a settled law of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="6556.264" offset="26330425">He -- he cited the Birmingham News case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6559.266" offset="26342442">The Birmingham News case Your Honor is a case where the Birmingham News wanted to have a shopping guide published and it employed a person, gave him an office in the Birmingham News Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.059" offset="26397612">He went out and solicited ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.746" offset="26408375">He had the shopping guide printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.472" offset="26419346">The printing company sued the Birmingham News because they weren't paid for the printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.848" offset="26436796">They had set the bills to the Birmingham News because they thought it was for the Birmingham News.</text>
            <text syncTime="6588.919" offset="26461142">And the Birmingham News didn't deny the fact that he was an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6591.910" offset="26473054">He had an office in the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="6593.195" offset="26478174">He was doing their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.936" offset="26485175">And the Court said in that case, because of the relationship with the party and because it certainly appeared that he was not an independent contractor that their failure to claim that he wasn't after they received the bills made them liable for the work that they had done in behalf of the Birmingham News.</text>
            <text syncTime="6612.981" offset="26557377">Now that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6615.375" offset="26566886">And when counsel states that case, I think he's trying to mislead the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6620.528" offset="26587575">In conclusion, I'd like merely to say this that this case has I think very broad significance because if -- if it should be affirmed or -- let's see there are four other cases now pending where a request for damages amount to $2,500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6644.861" offset="26684855">There are cases pending against CBS, damages amount to $1,300,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6649.949" offset="26705230">There are other cases against the New York Times for a request of damages of $1,800,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6654.800" offset="26724665">And if this case should stand in the cause the civil rights will be set back a great many years.</text>
