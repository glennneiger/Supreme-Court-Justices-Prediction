            <label>Mr. Denver W. Meacham</label>
            <text syncTime="7.488" offset="133308">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.683" offset="138115">At the adjournment yesterday, we were talking about specific items of evidence which the Government felt was incompetent that was allowed to go before the Commission in which they may have used in their determination of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.267" offset="212407">The first of this as mentioned -- mentioned in their petition but not mentioned in their brief and it has to do with offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.213" offset="236231">The Government contends that offers were introduced in evidence and they may have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.774" offset="258487">The situation with regard to offer is at page 74 of the record, an effort was made to prove that there were no offers, and for that reason there was a depreciation in market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.638" offset="317942">There was no longer any demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.342" offset="328704">At that place in the record, the Court sustained the Government's objection and no evidence was entered in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.855" offset="362768">Again at page 118 with respect to tract 124 (e), the witness there again -- an effort was made to prove that he did has some offers prior to the taking of the easement that he had no offers afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.001" offset="435388">No dollars and cents were mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.932" offset="443120">No -- no amount was mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.841" offset="450748">It was merely an effort to show that there had -- there was a decrease demand and therefore diminution in market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.631" offset="485857">At that place, the Court did allow that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.880" offset="498918">I submit to this Court that that would in no way, prejudice the Commission would be nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.413" offset="521070">There were no dollars and cents, nothing that would, in any way, color the finding of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.660" offset="562030">The other item they mentioned both in their petition and in their brief is the managerial skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.620" offset="589824">The Government felt that one of the witnesses took into account managerial skill and that this would be a nontransferable and therefore, it would not be a proper item to base just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.074" offset="639666">The evidence on that is at page 170 of the record and here is the evidence on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.834" offset="662758">The evidence, this witness testified that a farmer who properly farmed his farm would have a better looking farm and therefore it would have better market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.523" offset="725452">Our used car lots here and all across the nation are examples of the fact that when you shine a piece of property up it does have an increased market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.624" offset="769860">And I submit to this Court that that is not incompetent and that in no way colors the determination by this Commission of just compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.455" offset="1625213">They're -- they're general principles, I agree with.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.877" offset="1662830">I -- I find no fault with their general principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.589" offset="1673697">That case -- in that case, they relied heavily on United States versus Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.190" offset="1692087">And if the Court will read that case, as we've stated in our brief, then as Mr. Champion has stated in his brief, you'll find in the Lewis case, the Ninth Circuit specifically says, "We do not feel it's necessary that the Commission find how they treated these -- these particular elements of -- of that enter into the ultimate just compensation that we discussed here yesterday in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.294" offset="1800547">You'll find that in Lewis case, it does not support the conclusion that the Fifth Circuit reaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.352" offset="1832730">Now, there's been some talk along this line that we've been just now discussing that there's a great difference of opinion in the various Circuit Courts of Appeal as to this particular manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.396" offset="1892916">Now, I think you'll find, as I did, when you examine these cases that this difference of opinion is more imaginary than real.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.468" offset="1929279">Their only difference of opinion is between the Tenth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit on the two cases that you have before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.935" offset="1959163">Now, all of the other cases are easily distinguishable because complexities enter in -- for instance there -- there might be a question of severance damage which there wasn't in our particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.875" offset="2018826">There maybe a question of special benefits and in all those cases was the -- upon which the Government relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.947" offset="2051114">You will find that in -- in each of those cases, I think and perhaps all of them, at least all of them for -- with -- with one possible exception, the Commission did not find what the highest and best use was.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.582" offset="2113703">The Government -- the Commission did not find how they treated severance damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.819" offset="2138676">The Commission did not find how they treated the problem of special benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.481" offset="2161246">Now our case is a very simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.037" offset="2167515">It has none of these complexities that enter into it and it's our contention that the opinion, as given by the Tenth Circuit, is very concise, very precise, and very objective, and each statement in that opinion, you will find, is under guarded with a citation which specifically supports that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.563" offset="2281618">Now on the other hand, with all due respects to the Fifth Circuit opinion in the case that is to follow, you'll find that the citations there do not support the position the Court takes in this particular case, in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.375" offset="2352880">It's our contention that there is no conflict in any of the circuits with -- with respect to the sufficiency of findings of fact except the conflict that you have before you today in this case and in the case that is to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.202" offset="2428217">I think the true rule as Justice White contented, I think that the true rule is that you take each particular fact situation and you determine it on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.423" offset="2477014">And you do not lay down broad general principles and then decide each case on those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.465" offset="2505226">I think each case varies and for that reason, you can't reach that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.106" offset="2527796">I do think as it happened in the Fifth Circuit, but as -- did not happen in my case, that it would be more regular if the District Court when he appointed the Commission, gave them detailed instructions as to what they should do and what they should not do after his out-o- pretrial conference and in that conference, determined the issues that they will be faced with and give them instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.624" offset="2637824">I think that would be the better -- better practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.546" offset="2649527">But the fact that that did not happen, in my particular case, does not mean that these findings of fact and conclusions of law are sufficient -- are insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.191" offset="2692159">The District Judge was able, by looking at our findings of fact and conclusions of law, to satisfy himself that -- that he knew what they have done and that it was not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.603" offset="2749733">Again, the Circuit Court of Appeals was able to look at the findings of fact and the conclusions of law of this Commission and they were satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.669" offset="2794036">I think those two things enter into the question and tend to prove that these findings of fact and conclusions below were sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.289" offset="2836564">I appreciate greatly your courtesy, your attention to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.191" offset="2868120">I sincerely and earnestly urge this Court to put a -- an end to this extended litigation that has gone on since March of 1956 for none at all amounts of just compensation that has been fixed for my people has become purely an academic matter at this stage because of the extended litigation in which they have been forced to extend.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.464" offset="2981177">I thank you very much.</text>
