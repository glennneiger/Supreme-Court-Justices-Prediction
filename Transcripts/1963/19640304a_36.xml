            <text syncTime="46.659" offset="290043">This is a civil antitrust case in which the government is appealing from the dismissal by the District Court after trial of a compliant challenging a bank merger under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.266" offset="344482">The merger involved a consolidation of the largest and the fourth largest bank in Fayette County, Kentucky and resulting institution, as I shall develop, had better than 50% of all the banking assets in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.865" offset="414804">Now in this case, unlike the Philadelphia bank case of last term, the government did not challenge this consolidation under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.974" offset="747290">Well I just don't know Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.282" offset="756485">It's -- the Philadelphia case certainly gives the government a very -- only weapon in dealing with this, but I would be reluctant to say that cases might not arise where it would be appropriate for us to have the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.308" offset="808626">And we also -- I might say we think that this case is brought under the Sherman Act, and we think in this case we have established a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.777" offset="842480">Lexington, Kentucky which is the county seat of Fayette County, Kentucky, is a medium sized city of about 60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.209" offset="880201">It's roughly -- the population of the county is roughly twice that.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.953" offset="899218">The city has -- the whole area since the war has undergone a remarkable industrial development.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.377" offset="924923">Prior to that time it was primarily a farming area.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.321" offset="936626">Since the war, it has undergone rapid industrialization, characterized primarily by the influx of major national concerns which set up a number of plants in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.877" offset="986885">At the time of the merger which was March 1st, 1961, there were total of six banks in Fayette county and preliminary matter, the District court in this case treated Fayette County as the relevant geographic market within which -- to test the effect of this merger on competition and our opponents do not challenge that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.357" offset="1088763">The two merging banks were the First National Bank and Trust Company and Security Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.551" offset="1121573">The First National was the oldest and the largest bank in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.613" offset="1141844">At the time of the merger, it was more than twice the size of any of the other banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.691" offset="1166085">Between its founding in 1865 and 1929, it had been involved in 12 different mergers consolidations or takeovers and at the time of the merger its deposits were $58 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.013" offset="1231391">It had $65 million in total assets and $35 million in total loans and as I shall demonstrate in a moment, this at that point represented the largest bank by far in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.778" offset="1282487">The Security Trust Company had been organized in the 1880s by the businessmen of the community, primarily to provide corporate trust services for the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.717" offset="1330239">This bank, until 1947, had not engaged in any so called commercial banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.490" offset="1353331">It was limiting itself to making of secured loans and providing trust services.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.537" offset="1369527">However in 1947, it went into the commercial field and experienced a very rapid growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.975" offset="1399306">Now we have set forth at Pages 10 and 11 of our brief, charts which show the statistical pattern of the distribution of the banking business in Fayette County and the first chart at the top of Page 10 shows the situation as it was prior to the merger and the Court will notice that at that point First National had roughly 40% of all the banking business in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.924" offset="1511111">It was at that point more than twice as large as the second bank, Citizen's Union, and was approximately three times or more the size of Security Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.687" offset="1558131">Now the effect of the consolidation is shown in the second chart on Page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.244" offset="1584358">The Court will note that the resulting bank now has more of the assets than all of other banks put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.875" offset="1606823">It has roughly 52 or 53% of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.694" offset="1622183">This bank is now three times as large as the second bank and roughly five or six times as large as the smallest bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.548" offset="1709537">That's right, but that we think is significant Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.976" offset="1719254">Of course it's just addition, but the significance we think is we have a big bank and this big bank has combined into a substantial bank and as I shall develop in a moment, this case rests not just on the percentages of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.971" offset="1767215">We think we have very important and persuasive evidence that in this market, this kind of concentration does have a markedly adverse affect on competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.394" offset="1896991">Well one thing Mr. Justice -- I have to answer that in several steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.933" offset="1915068">One thing as far as security is concerned, is that security did have an advantage, which it had its trust business, and the trust business as the record indicates does give a bank an advantage in going into the commercial business.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.467" offset="1969194">But more important than that we think is that, and just let me say that they make the argument that the fact that First National at a prior period had a larger share of the market and had since drop down to 40%, that shows competition would not adversely affected within this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.540" offset="2037530">Well, we think there is two things to that, first there is affirmative evidence by the Presidents of three of the other banks in the area that in these circumstances, combining 50% into this bank, with all of the advantages which I'll come to in a moment, does place them under a serious competitive advantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.027" offset="2187473">Well, I think the answer Mr. Justice to that as the testimony in the record indicates that it's customary when you have a merger of two banks, if there is some attrition in the share of the merging bank for a brief period and indeed there was recognition that this was not unexpected in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.911" offset="2266990">And over and beyond that we think that the competition which is to be protected in this case, the competition, the protection of the other banks that is not, the negative effects are not offset because there has been a slight increase in the percentage shares of the other banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.421" offset="2353089">The bankers, the three bankers, the presidents of the other banks in town testified, or testified that there concern was over the long range effect of this, in the long run the greater economic power that this bank would be able to bear, bring to bear.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.293" offset="2476596">And we think it's in the interest of the public that there be a number of effective banks in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.664" offset="2501987">In other words, what the statute is prohibiting is the elimination of an important competitor where this will have adverse affects on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.054" offset="2535633">And there are adverse effects on competition we think when the remaining competitors in the market will find it more difficult, seriously difficult to be competing as effectively as they had in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.944" offset="2579101">I think Mr. Justice I would like to point to one aspect of the case that I haven't yet mentioned which is suggested by our chart on the top of Page 11 and that is a tremendous share of the corporate trust business which will be the result of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.322" offset="2648691">Although First National only went into the trust business about 20 years ago, it had managed to gain a very substantial share of that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.261" offset="2684426">At the time of the merger it had roughly 45% as against roughly 50% in terms of total trust assets of Security Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.783" offset="2718490">Now the effect of this merger is to combine in a single bank 95% in dollar amount of all the corporate trusts in the community and I think it would be appropriate, this by the way would be 28 more times as large as any of the other banks in the area, and I think it's appropriate --</text>

            <text syncTime="695.967" offset="2887241">We are not pressing before this Court the argument that there was a violation of Section 2 insofar as it affected a combination to monopolize commercial banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.070" offset="2935620">The reason for that is we think if we prevail on Section 1, the Court doesn't have to reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.588" offset="2957772">If we lose on Section 1 frankly we think it is also dispositive of Section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.847" offset="3046797">I think we will stand on our brief on that because again the Court need to only to reach that argument if it disagrees with those of the Sherman Act point.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.818" offset="3386598">Yes I will come to that in just one moment if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.295" offset="3404570">This case -- this case is perhaps an unusual case in that three of the four other banks in the area, the next three largest, the presidents of those institutions all testified that in their view this merger would adversely affect competition in the community and they explained at considerable length why they believe that this would have such an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.988" offset="3519300">The, I might also just point out once again, reiterate, they recognized that in the year since the merger, the trial is approximately one year after the merger, they had not noticed any discernible immediate effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.417" offset="3565066">In fact their percentages have grown slightly, but they were concerned, they said with the long range trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.032" offset="3591502">Now, the first reason they gave why this large bank would put them under a serious competitive disadvantage, rested on the character of the business community of Lexington.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.096" offset="3639777">As I had indicated Lexington has had a very remarkable economic growth and you had a large number of national firms coming in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.832" offset="3678751">And they say that when a national firm comes into an area where it is not previously familiar, what the national firm's officials generally do is they pay great weight to the balance sheet of the banks, they don't know anything about these banks, they have to select a bank in which to deposit their funds and traditionally they look around, they want to get the largest bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.516" offset="3773419">This is understandable of course because the Federal Deposit Insurance Company's insurance is limited to $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.645" offset="3801945">So in one of these big firms, it makes very substantial deposit, they want to be able to look and see that they have a powerful, a strong healthy institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.018" offset="3843427">And thus each of these individuals testified that the very size of the bank, the fact that it is three times bigger than the next that it has 50% of the market, that fact itself is a powerful magnet in attracting new business to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.232" offset="3916257">Now in addition, the size would permit the new bank to do various things which would give it a competitive advantage over some of the smaller banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.837" offset="3962755">For example, most of the banks spend a great deal of money in advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.704" offset="3982190">This is one of the most vigorous ways in which they compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.847" offset="3998804">Traditionally, the amount they spend on advertising is directly related to the amount of their deposits, and so having more deposits, being a bigger bank is able to spend more on advertising and thus get a competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.987" offset="4055333">There are other things for example that the new bank being large, it would be in a better position to put in automated equipment, they will be better able being a larger bank to hire more specialized personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.271" offset="4104443">And now Mr. Justice Goldberg, I would like to discuss a question you raised, what the significance of having 95% of the trust businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.618" offset="4145821">The witnesses discuss that at considerable detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.058" offset="4159613">The first thing they pointed out is that trust business and commercial businesses are reciprocal sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.391" offset="4192946">In other words, if you have a large active trust department this helps you in obtaining commercial business and conversely if you have a large commercial business, this helps you in obtaining trust business and the record indicates that it was the extensive trust business of Security Trust Company which enabled it to move ahead so rapidly in the commercial field.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.593" offset="4397746">There was another point that was made by the witnesses, is that this combined bank with its 95% of the trust assets in the community had among other things a very substantial portion of the choice downtown real estate and this they said gave it something of an entrée in getting the commercial business of the tenants of this property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.713" offset="4586245">The District Court in this case did not make detailed finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.154" offset="4600038">The District Court's opinion is very short and he did make of course the ultimate finding that this would not restrain competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.853" offset="4630758">To that extent that has to be overturned, but I don't think there are any specific findings in the sense of the -- finding that there was no conspiracy, there is not that type of finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.475" offset="4669315">This case is somewhat unusual in that the District Court's findings and opinion occupying only about six pages of the printed record and one other little -- just a little fact on the trust business is the effect of the merger was to give this bank control of the only newspaper in town which had previously been in the hands of trust, in the hands of Security Trust and now it's now in the hands of the merged bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.878" offset="4770879">Now the testimony went beyond this, however, because all of these witnesses, these three bank officials testified that the size of Security Trust now gave it such an advantage that the other banks might well have to consider a merger in order to be able to compete effectively against the economic power of Security Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.612" offset="4877772">In this market the number of banks has dropped from 19 -- in 1929 there were 10 banks in the area, at the time of this merger there are only five as a result of this merger and that's what we have, it seems to us in this small city in Central Kentucky, is a confirmation of the broad trend to a concentration in banking which this Court noted last term in the Philadelphia Bank case, and indeed there is dramatic evidence in this case of the danger which we think this merger poses in terms of further accretions of concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.051" offset="5027610">The second largest bank in the city is the Citizens Union Bank which had roughly 17% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.046" offset="5059584">The Citizens Union Bank is itself the product of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.575" offset="5073690">In 1954 two of the other banks merged to form this merger and the President of the Citizens Union Bank testified that he principle reason for this merger was that so that it's bank, this new bank could compete more effectively with the First National Bank which was then the largest bank in town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.546" offset="5157595">Now with this -- this is the factual situation as it existed and as the result of the merger and we think that these facts show that the consolidation constitute a combination and unreasonable restraint of trade and violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.457" offset="5245158">As I have indicated on this phase of the case, there is no issue as to either the relevant product market, commercial banking or the relevancy of graphical market and the question before the Court is thus, what the effect of this merger had on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.990" offset="5311300">We rest our case on two perhaps related propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.449" offset="5333138">First proposition is we think under the so called railroad merger cases, this merger was bad because it resulted in the elimination of substantial competition between the two merging companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.800" offset="5386533">Secondly, we say that even if it does not violate that standard that under the standards enunciated in this Court's latest decision dealing with horizontal mergers under Section 1, the Columbia Steel decision, this merger must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.558" offset="5461556">Now, let me just briefly refer to the railroad cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.982" offset="5475349">We've set them forth, discussing them at considerable length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.268" offset="5492485">These were a series of cases in the first quarter of the century in which this Court had before it combinations of railroads, they were mostly transcontinental railroads, and these cases the Court condemned as violations of both Section 1 and Section 2 apparently of the Sherman Act, a combination of railroads which eliminated substantial competition between the merging roads themselves and in reaching -- making these holdings the Court did not look to see what was the share of the market not controlled by the other railroads, did not consider how effective the remaining competition was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.117" offset="5667819">And one of the leading cases for example was the Union Pacific Railroad, where this Court struck down the Union Pacific's acquisition of a controlling share in the Southern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.111" offset="5715780">The Court recognized that the business for which these two carriers were competing was only a comparatively small part of their total traffic, but it nevertheless found that there was a substantial amount of competition between them, because they had competed for million of dollars worth of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.995" offset="5803342">And in the Columbia Steel case of course this Court said that the railroad cases were not that controlling and so they were distinguishable on their facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.838" offset="5846706">However, this Court has never questioned the authority of those cases and indeed it cited them apparently with approval, last term, in the Philadelphia Bank case for the proposition of the Sherman Act does apply to horizontal mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.934" offset="5907101">We think those cases sound and we think they basically rest on a self evident economic proposition, which is it there can be no more complete restraint of trade than the combination of two independent companies that are competing with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.809" offset="5978572">When you have two competitors that are combined immediately and forever all competition between them terminates, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.604" offset="6009814">As far as the marketplace is concerned there is no competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.960" offset="6027264">So that it seems to us --</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.984" offset="8063352">Well we did but those doubts were resolved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.745" offset="8082369">Now on -- let me if I may I'd like to discuss the various factors which the Court said discussed in Columbia Steel and point out why we think that under those standards this merger does run afoul of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.480" offset="8141302">The first standard is percentage of business control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.530" offset="8165543">Here the evidence was that they controlled more than 50%, that they had more than 90% of the trust business, and that the trust business was an important element in developing the commercial business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.436" offset="8221132">So that in this case the share of the market held by the merging banks is roughly 50% greater than the share of the market held in the Philadelphia Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.846" offset="8278706">The second question is the strength of the remaining competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.297" offset="8296573">Well, the merged bank as I have indicated is at least three times as large as the next largest bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.216" offset="8328234">It's six times as large as the remaining bank and in the trust field is 28 times as large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.208" offset="8360208">In the Philadelphia case, the two combining banks were less than twice as large as the next bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.788" offset="8390510">So once again what we have here is the two merging firms, have a very substantial advantage over the next one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.780" offset="8426454">The third thing is whether the action springs from business requirements or purpose to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.297" offset="8448606">Since I advised Mr. Justice Harlan, there is nothing in this record to show any predatory purpose in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.985" offset="8475355">On the other hand, the District Court did find that the banks were healthy and that there was no necessity for this merger to protect the depositors or the stockholders of the banks, and I will in a moment come to the business justifications, which the defendants have suggested for the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.920" offset="8555081">I might just say in anticipation, we don't think those are sufficient justifications to validate the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.473" offset="8585279">The fourth item is the probable development of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.312" offset="8600639">Here again, we have a record of an increase in concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.178" offset="8616103">The number of banks was cut by 50% in a period of less than 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.877" offset="8642853">The presidents of the three other banks testified that they would have to consider margining in order to meet the economic power of this bank and that finally, one of the leading banks in the community was itself a product of a merger whose purpose was to compete more effectively with the big bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.725" offset="8718294">The fifth item is consumer demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.996" offset="8731355">Now the merger, the elimination of a strong and vigorous bank took place at a time when this community, this area was undergoing a remarkable economic growth and when as the Federal Deposit Insurance Company stated in it's report to the Comptroller of the Currency, that the merger had an adverse effect on competition, there was a strong demand for credit in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.718" offset="8834278">And finally the less (Inaudible) of other characteristics of the market we think here the fact of the bigness of the bank in this particular market attracting other customers, the advantages possessed by the trust business and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.101" offset="8907734">I now like to turn to the justifications which the appellees have offered for this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.633" offset="8937932">Basically their justification is that the larger bank will be able to obtain deposits from two new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.696" offset="8974190">First they say being a larger and stronger bank they will be able to obtain deposits from these large corporations coming into the area which they have hitherto not been able to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.445" offset="9017135">Secondly, they state that being larger, they will be able to obtain from the country banks and the surrounding area, the so called correspondent deposits which they have hitherto been unable to obtain and as large volume as they had hoped and which have been going to larger cities such as Cincinnati and Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.433" offset="9101145">And the argument then is that having this additional cash in the way of deposits in the bank, and as a result of an increase in the bank's capital due to combining the two banks, this will enable them to make greater loans and this will benefit to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.455" offset="9177213">Now we have a number of answers to this, the first answer is as far as increasing of the capital is concerned the record shows there are other methods by which a bank may increase it's capital than merging with a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.440" offset="9225174">They can issue stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.940" offset="9231130">It has been done by some of the banks and there was testimony that -- one the witnesses, one of the defendant's witnesses that he thought this bank could have sold stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.077" offset="9267702">They can transfer some of their undivided profits to surplus and thus increase their capital and increase their individual loan limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.432" offset="9309080">And as far as making larger loans are concerned, these can be made through participation with the correspondent banks because just as some of the smaller banks maintain deposits in the Lexington banks, so the Lexington banks in turn maintain deposits with larger banks and the larger citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.310" offset="9388596">But basically we think this argument comes down to the contention that because this merger will be beneficial to the community, because it'll help banking in the community this somehow validates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.772" offset="9466441">Now, really we think this is basically the same argument which was made in the Philadelphia Bank case in which this Court rejected in Philadelphia Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.607" offset="9509804">The argument is frequently made in anti-trust cases that what has been done is valid because it's serving a legitimate commercial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.825" offset="9550660">For example in the Fashion Originators Guild the argument was made that what was there been done was all right because it was necessary to prevent style piracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.435" offset="9589112">And we think that when conduct as this kind of a merger has what is to us a demonstrated anti-competitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.891" offset="9626937">It doesn't lose it's anti-competitive consequence, because of the fact that in other areas, in other aspects of the economy there maybe certain beneficial advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.240" offset="9676361">Now, the legal argument, the legal argument that is made here basically is that the fact and I've referred to this earlier, the fact that the share of the market which the first National Bank had some 20 years ago, at that time it was 50% and in the intervening period it has dropped to roughly 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.401" offset="9768939">The argument is that this decline in the shares of the, of the old bank indicates that having this kind of a share of the market does not in fact cause any injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.156" offset="9836022">That smaller banks are able to compete despite the size of the large bank and then of course the stress point is also made that this is confirmed according to the appellees by the statistic showing that in the 10 months since the merger, the merging bank's share of the market has declined slightly 1% to 2% as I have indicated on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.302" offset="9920554">There was evidence that this is not unusual and was anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.378" offset="9936854">Now, the record doesn't show why in a 20-year period the First National Bank's share of the market dropped from roughly 50% to roughly 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.950" offset="9991189">We don't know whether the conditions that existed in this market at that time are comparable to those today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.539" offset="10025566">We do know and the record shows that at the present time, the competing banks are very much concerned at the increase in the power of, the economic power which this bank would have as a result of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.783" offset="10090454">And as far as it can be told, as far as this record shows, what has happened is that in the 20-year period since the First National had 50% of the market, it dropped as little as 10 points presumably as a result of normal competitive process, this is competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.316" offset="10160671">You may have one share of the market and if you don't competitive effectively you may not be able to hold it and we think that if this one thing that's clear under the antitrust laws is that when you lose part of your market through the normal processes of competition, if you want to get that share of the market back, you have to get it back through competition and you can't, having less than 10% through competition, get the 10% back by buying up one of your competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.807" offset="10282611">I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.331" offset="10460662">Now in getting to that I would like to first address myself to a question which Mr. Justice Goldberg asked and that is as to the importance of the decision in this case as a precedent, and it seems to me that since the decision in the Philadelphia case that there is practically no importance precedent wise in the decision of this case and therefore it's not of great importance to the government or the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.400" offset="10604962">That is not true if you turn the situation around because this is a case of first impression in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.254" offset="10644355">On the proposition that here is a bank which has already merged and has operated for a substantial period of time as a merged bank and now you are being asked to adjudge that bank guilty of a violation of the Sherman Act on proof which amounts to almost nothing more than percentage of concentration without any proof as to the effect of that percentage, which might be proper and a Clayton Act test which we submit is no answer at all in the Sherman Act test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.995" offset="10807359">And we are faced on the other hand it is a matter of grave importance to us, because if a divestiture should ordered and that is, that is the remedy which the government seeks in this case, it puts our bank in small community of Lexington in a position that no banks has ever been in before and it's difficult to know what would result from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.312" offset="10996590">The -- I want to address myself to the proposition of the time schedule a little later on if I may, but as to what the effect of ordering a divestiture in the case of a bank which has merged and has operated for a considerable period of time, the effect of that would be appalling and I like to quote from, for you very briefly if I may from an affidavit which was filed by my good friend Mr. Larry Williams who tried this case for the government in Lexington, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.726" offset="11138278">And in that affidavit which was filed in the California bank litigation, he had trust litigation, he said in these cases where the merging banks have merged before a temporary restraining order or temporary injunction could issue, serious problems, insoluble by a divesture decree may have been created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.791" offset="11242559">Even attempts made in good faith to separate the properties and accounts of merged banks pending a final decision on the merits of a challenged merger cannot avoid inconvenience, extreme inconvenience to (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.556" offset="11313612">Now that's very appropriate in this case because at the outset the District Court entered an order directing the merged bank to try to keep separate books to show what business might have belonged to one bank and what business might have belonged to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.909" offset="11391039">But the court recognized that that had never been tried before and might be impossible and so he (Inaudible) order in the language that the merged bank could, should do that insofar as it could do it in conformity with banking regulations and existing laws and in conformity with the standards of good sound banking and we have tried this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.444" offset="11681102">This application for merger was filed in the later part of 1960 and of course when that is filed with the Comptroller, the Justice Department is immediately notified and they are immediately are under the duty to investigate the situation as to the competitive effects, which might result and the affect on interstate commerce which might result from the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.553" offset="11785592">And so the government in this case did make such an investigation and we are fully cognizant of the situation long before the merger took place, when they filed their report with the Comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.712" offset="11838255">Now back in January the 10th the banks received a letter from the Justice Department in which they said, we are looking into this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.285" offset="11880469">In effect they said, we are looking into this matter of your merger and if there is anything wrong with it, we are going to let you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.077" offset="11911711">Now the next thing we knew and we knew that the Department of Justice and the FDIC and various other branches of control were supposed to file reports and the final decision of the Comptroller was to be based on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.514" offset="11977435">We didn't know whether the report of the Justice Department was favorable or unfavorable, but some weeks after we got that letter, on the 24th day of February of 1961, we received a telephone call from the Comptroller's office advising us that the merger had been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.759" offset="12058415">We had no reason to suspect if there was an adverse report from the Justice Department, because on January the 10th they have said, don't you contact us, we'll let you know, we'll let you hear from us and we had heard nothing and it was in the press and the government knew that it had been approved and they took -- they didn't tell us that we shouldn't, they took no steps to stop us and so we asked the Comptroller to make it affective on March the 1st and Comptroller acquiesced in that and did make it affective on March the 1st This merger was approved at the same time that the Philadelphia merger was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.601" offset="12217762">Government had no difficult in stepping in and filing their suit before the Philadelphia banks merged and thereby didn't allow them to get themselves and not only themselves, but the general public into the situation which we would be faced with, of trying to separate these merged banks, and so the government, they knew what was going on and they told us that they would write us a letter and let us hear from them about their decision in their matter and we heard nothing and we went on in normal course of business and merged on the 1st day of March.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.405" offset="13472998">We found it was impossible to do it many fields of the bank's activities and in many others it was very much incompatible with sound banking practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.345" offset="13516779">As a matter of fact just for example there were checks of course, printed checks on this Security Trust and on the First National Bank and by trying to keep separate accounts somebody who had money in the merged bank might write a check on the First National and that would be on the Security Trust in these records and these check would get sent back insufficient funds when as a matter of fact he had plenty of money in the merged bank to take care of it and there were many fields where it mixed us up so that it was just not in accordance with sound banking principles to be able to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.897" offset="13970996">Yes sir, the Court didn't hear it on that ex parte hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.648" offset="13985938">He put it off till we had notice and we did go back and appeared, and of course we didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.823" offset="14010702">It had never been tried before in the history of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.036" offset="14023555">We didn't know whether we could practically comply with that order or not until we tried it and so we went ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.577" offset="14049677">As the Court said we might as merged bank and tried honestly and faithfully to do that, but it just worked out, it was impossible in many fields of bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.076" offset="14099728">Now getting down to the situation of whether or not we are guilty of the Sherman Act rather than addressing myself to the relief in case we are and that is the main issue as far as we are concerned, I think the other one has been somewhat relieved by the Justice Department's concession in his response to our motion that they are not asking this Court to judge a divestiture now, they are merely asking this -- well they are asking the Court to do, but they wouldn't object if this Court didn't judge that, but would send it back to the take proof on what would be the appropriate remedy on all the circumstances, but even that puts us in a position where we don't know what might happen to our bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.076" offset="14267643">It might cost a run on the bank, except we have no crystal ball, we don't know, it's never been tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.449" offset="14293138">I am almost at 2:30, so I like to just read you one very short quotation on that particular problem before I go on to the question of whether the Sherman Act has actually been violated here or not, and that is a quotation from a Mr. Funk who is an eminent writer on the Laws of Banking and economics and in a work entitled Antitrust Legislation Affecting Bank Mergers here is what he had to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.467" offset="14413197">The picture of an attack on a bank merger after it has been consummated is a shocking one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.996" offset="14439320">Public confidence in the institution would be shaken and might be entirely destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.167" offset="14464084">The task of disentangling the two components of the merged bank would be almost inseparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.859" offset="14490833">Great loss might result to the shareholders and possibly to the public and that's what we are up against.</text>
