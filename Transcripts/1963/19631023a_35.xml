            <text syncTime="10.677" offset="146056">In the spring and summer of 1961 had begun a new phase in the struggle to obtain integration in the south and to arrive at a new level of dignity of mankind as we would further have it under our democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.000" offset="219408">On June 15th, 1961, the petitioners' news case as part of a "Freedom Ride" arrived in the respondent city, the City of Tallahassee as part of a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.087" offset="287744">They testified that they wanted to bear witnesses as -- as ministers, rabbis and clergymen to the struggle to obtain those rights guaranteed them by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.909" offset="343019">But first, in order to bear witness, they wanted to test transportation facilities to determine if there were facilities available on an integrated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.618" offset="393801">What is a test?</text>
            <text syncTime="74.853" offset="402787">Legally, a test to this kind is not quite the same thing as what we mean by a legal test.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.660" offset="434030">We would define it for the purposes of this case as an opportunity to determine the availability of one's constitutional rights and to do so peaceably until that right is made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.925" offset="495052">Their first test in Tallahassee came when they arrived in a clearway to a bus terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.569" offset="521697">They were met by some citizens who obviously hostile and menacing to a certain degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.192" offset="560149">They were also met by what the police department and into the police termed "adequate police protection".</text>
            <text syncTime="122.779" offset="594526">Some of them tested the facilities of the bus terminal by eating in the coffee shop, testing the restroom and the waiting room.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Dixon</label>
            <text syncTime="149.986" offset="703300">And -- they could test that because the south literally objects to the mixture of the races in any social situations as well as to the injection of any negroes into a social situation or into a situation that legally -- that we -- we legally we maintain is their -- by rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.931" offset="791071">In short, by the -- in -- by their mixing, it is a violation with the morals and customs of the south.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.061" offset="919594">It is the city that is 475 miles distance from the most metropolitan area and retains the flavor and color of the old competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.840" offset="966719">In the process of testing, they -- they had arrived at the terminal's point, the City of Tallahassee and they proceeded to go to the Tallahassee terminal to take air transportation back to their homes in the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.806" offset="1042578">Some of the passengers, when arriving, confirmed their reservations and proceeded to take the plane out that was due at the airport at about 3:25 on June the 15th, 1961.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.431" offset="2233135">And upon that happening in -- within half an hour, they were approached by the city attorney for the City of Tallahassee who identified himself as the special police officer of the city and said, "I am advised that your assembly here was tend to create a disturbance or incite a riot or disorderly conduct within the City of Tallahassee.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.039" offset="2459564">The City Attorney Messer immediately ordered the officers to arrest the 10 petitioners and they were taken to the jail and booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.117" offset="2491852">The following morning, several of the petitioners out on bond and in haste to return to the various portions, they did it because it was Saturday and they had to get back to preach, went by the terminal restaurant and again, the sign was close but again, there were white people inside the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.647" offset="2561964">But again, in -- with regard to this restaurant, it had opened up Saturday morning and was only closed apparently when the petitioners came by to board their plane after they were released from jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.204" offset="2616195">The trial proceeded on the following week on June 22nd and petitioners' counsel filed a motion to quash which raised due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment rights to equal protection of laws and the protection of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.408" offset="2696965">In the trial, there was no evidence whatsoever as -- as to any unlawful rioters or to move to its conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.191" offset="2744090">However -- and in addition thereto, the testimony adequately discloses that there was complete police protection provided for the petitioners at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.246" offset="2796335">Now, the Florida statute provided that in order for that to be unlawful assembly, there had to be of any persons or persons whether armed or not unlawfully, riotously or tumultuously assembled within the City of Tallahassee.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.239" offset="2900302">The mayor or any officer specified in the statute within the opinion of the said mayor or any officers, there is -- the assembly of such persons shall tend to create a disturbance or incite a riot or disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.544" offset="2961533">The mayor may go among the persons or the duly delegated officer and advised them to disperse and if they failed to do so, they will be considered guilty of the crime -- charge of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.247" offset="3016391">The evidence failed to disclose that these facilities were not integrated, that is to say, every -- every witness who has something to do with the facility testified that these were a segregated facilities from the -- actually, the white waiting room and separate negro waiting room to the restroom and into the restaurant themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="4415.318" offset="17764603">If I might address myself an issue to the question raised by Justice Black, dealing with the Edward decision from Carolina in distinguish, if I may, the application of the theory expressed by Justice Clark, not denied by the majority of this Court in the different set of factual situation that we have in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.488" offset="17861360">In the Edward decision, you say that under the circumstances that this group of demonstrator were arrested that they were denied the exercise of federal constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.034" offset="17931473">Now, those demonstrators had arrived at a place before the building the house of legislation of that State and it had been there from all late that morning for a period of maybe an hour, the best I could determine from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.248" offset="18012348">During that period of time, the temperature within which they found themselves had changed to some degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.060" offset="18039620">But nonetheless, they had continued to exercise what you recognize is their right of free speech and freedom of assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.302" offset="18080580">Then, the officer in charge or the responsible person charge with the preservation of peace to that community determined that they continue exercise of that right that you recognized constituted a breach of the peace, the majority of this Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.535" offset="18165530">That -- that did not constitute a breach of the peace that it constituted the continued exercise of a constitutional right which you recognized and therefore, reversed the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.629" offset="18213909">Our position is that in the language expressed by Justice Clark in the dissent in that case that he recognized something that this Court has not declined to recognize, that is a corresponding responsibility and a corresponding constitutional duty on the part of those charged with the preservation of peace and tranquility within a community irrespective of the exercise of a constitutional right of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.474" offset="18333236">Under the ordinance in question in the City of Tallahassee, the ordinance provided that within the opinion of those charged under the ordinance with carrying in to force in effect, they work of the opinion and concerned with the breach of the peace that is the assembly of the such person would tend to create a disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.126" offset="18495927">That mean the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.148" offset="18503973">That's not fraud, nebulous language but rather specific language that somebody under the terms of the ordinance is charged with the responsibility of carrying out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.073" offset="18547649">Now, when, under those circumstances, that law enforcement officer determines that the continued assemblage of persons would tend to create a disturbance or to incite a riot or other disorderly conduct and so forth, that it becomes an unlawful assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.883" offset="18626853">That's a very specific charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.101" offset="18635734">And factually in the instance before the Court, we have a situation in which the petitions exercised this right, not for a matter of an hour or hour and a half or half a day but from about the middle of day on Thursday when they got to Tallahassee until the back in the middle of the following day when they were ultimately arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.057" offset="18723610">You have a record which reflects the change during that period of time of some 24 hours of the temperature and atmosphere within which they had, 24-hour period, been exercising that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.024" offset="18779512">What we are saying is that the exercise of a constitutional right are the continued pursuit of what is initially a lawful pursuit can become an unlawful pursuit or can become the abuse of a constitutional right in light of a specific ordinance or a corresponding constitutional duty placed upon those charges of responsibility of preserving the peace and tranquility within the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="5001.209" offset="20108204">In any event, I would like to suggest one-forth which we will brief in this -- in this memorandum to permit me to draw the analogy of Fay against Noia.</text>

            <text syncTime="5138.350" offset="20656776">If I don't like what you have to say, I get up a crowd, I make noise and then I'm arrested for disorderly conduct or as in the case here for a violation of the -- of the so called riot act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.334" offset="20728665">This -- we -- we suggest that this approach is really part of the discriminatory segregation attitude of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.353" offset="20784776">And I -- I would like to refer this Court to -- to page 18 of the respondent's brief in this Court because while the comments are entirely irrelevant to a legal proceeding, they illustrate perfectly the state of mind that was gathering together against the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.709" offset="20870248">And I read from the top of the page, part of this brief is written on August 28th, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.596" offset="20897729">As one of the riders was reading the morning papers under a byline of a national news syndicate, the main headlines refer to the mass march of certain persons, predominantly negro who are marching in groups of thousands of persons on Washington D.C., the capital of this country, in protest and to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.501" offset="20977351">Certainly, but no orderly purpose other than to show some type of brute or political strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.005" offset="21007444">Respondent urges that such a demonstration and protest is an unlawful assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.789" offset="21034506">Now, this, of course, is quite irrelevant to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.251" offset="21048404">But I think it shows the state of mind of the public officials of Tallahassee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.375" offset="21068884">They were -- it is clear that anything that the petitioners did in this case, anything they did at all, their mere presence in an integrated group would have -- would have been flamed the community and they were going to arrest them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.117" offset="21123845">The same thing happened in our -- one of our previous cases, Taylor against Louisiana, where the negroes in the bus station at Shreveport -- I think the only other freedom right case that has come to this Court on the merits, the same type of situation arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.241" offset="21188315">And of course, this Court has spoken in Garner against Louisiana on a similar type situation where the guinea pig becomes the crime -- the committer of the crime because he is roasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.181" offset="21240142">This is really what have comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.445" offset="21269191">Mr. Rhodes said a moment ago that it was his view that when in the opinion of those carrying out the ordinance, the assemblage would tend to create a disturbance that becomes unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.116" offset="21347871">We suggest, and I suggest in closing, that if these were the law, we would have a literal police state in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.860" offset="21386846">I think the cases of this Court, as well as in many other higher courts, have previously decided that there is a right upon the part of the citizen to refuse to obey an illegal order of a police official.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.020" offset="21451421">Since no acts of any kind are shown in this record of any illegal conduct on the part of these petitioners, I think based upon the previous decisions of this Court, that the petitioners had the right to refuse, to obey the illegal order of the policemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.719" offset="21534281">If they do not have that right, then we have a police state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.797" offset="21550582">With that, I trust the Court will forgive if I don't use all the time that is available to us but we will perhaps exercise that right by the supplementary memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.903" offset="21591019">I wish to thank the Court for the opportunity herein.</text>
