            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="56.963" offset="331212">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.615" offset="353782">This case is here on appeal by the United States from a judgment of the District Court in the Northern District of New York or the Western District perhaps, dismissing the complaint in an action under Section 7 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.882" offset="422849">The case is one of unusual importance because of a trend that seems to us to have developed in the metals industries in recent years, for the large basic integrated companies to acquire smaller independent fabricators in an effort to expand into other related and sometimes competitive basis of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.326" offset="524727">We have a number of cases pending at that time in an effort to arrest the trend, thinking that it violates Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.745" offset="554402">Here, the acquiring company is the Aluminum Company of America, the giant of the aluminum industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.940" offset="583137">The acquired company was Rome Cable Corporation, a strong independent manufacturer of chiefly insulated wire and cable, both aluminum and copper, for use by electric light and power companies in the transmission and distribution of electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.966" offset="667251">The essential facts, the questions being the same as in all in Section 7 cases, the essential facts may be summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.750" offset="706330">Alcoa, as I say, is the giant of the aluminum industry until World War II, of course, it acquired -- it had a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.325" offset="748648">After the war, the United States disposed of the aluminum facilities that it had constructed in such a way that Kaiser and Reynolds entered the field as fully integrated producers of aluminum and aluminum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.100" offset="807790">Since 1950, three somewhat smaller producers have entered the field but this is still an industry of few concerns with great economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.324" offset="860662">The big three have 90% of the ingot capacity, Alcoa with 38% of the ingot capacity, is almost 50% bigger than any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.355" offset="912802">In addition, as the Court I'm sure knows, Alcoa owns and operates mining locations, railroads, steamship lines, basic aluminum plants, rolling mills, many facilities for producing fabricated aluminum down to the --</text>

            <text syncTime="224.454" offset="1001200">Well, it seems to me that one must envisage this case not simply as the market for conducting but its relation to the overall aluminum industry that you can't forget the industry as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.913" offset="1063058">I would think that was while background, one of the dominating facts and that's just only importance but a very great importance, I think, in the overall picture of the power of the acquiring company.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.162" offset="1300041">One of the major end uses of aluminum is in wire and cable for conducting electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.941" offset="1339120">It's about 7% of the ingot capacity goes into that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.623" offset="1357824">Originally, of course, copper was the favorite conductor of electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.806" offset="1374647">And for many purposes, copper today has such a marked advantage, technological advantage that aluminum cannot compete with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.374" offset="1408920">Aluminum, as I will explain later in more detail, has a very marked economic advantage in use for overhead wire and cable, except in coastal areas where the problems of corrosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.017" offset="1459388">And as a result, aluminum has rapidly displaced copper for overhead use.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.491" offset="1485302">Today, nearly 95% of the installations of bare transmission line are of aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.676" offset="1522082">About 80% of the installations of bare distribution line are of aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.299" offset="1548518">As an aluminum -- as an insulated overhead conductor too, aluminum is -- is rapture -- rapidly capturing the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.733" offset="1582268">In 1950, only about 6.5% of the new installations were made of aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.594" offset="1613720">In 1955, 51% of the insulated overhead installations were of aluminum and in 1959, the line had gone still farther up and it was 77 and a fraction percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.864" offset="1690833">Alcoa has been the dominant fabricator and seller of both types of aluminum overhead conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.963" offset="1727195">Its percentage of the market has declined as a result of the government policy in breaking the monopoly in setting up for Kaiser and Reynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.293" offset="1764498">But it is still a fact that in 1958, the year prior to the merger, Alcoa sold 32.5% of the bare aluminum conductor, ranking first, and 11.6% of the insulated aluminum conductor, ranking third.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.239" offset="1844328">Taking the two together as a measure in these related lines Alcoa sold 27.8% of all aluminum conductor more than any other company.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.489" offset="1897305">Shortly before the merger, Alcoa's officials began to worry about maintaining what they called its number one spot in the aluminum conductor field especially because Kaiser, its chief competitor, had acquired the wire and cable facilities of U.S. Rubber Company, a merger that is also under attack under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.028" offset="1991450">Alcoa, being heavily in the bare field, lacked a full line of aluminum wire, both bare and insulated and especially the insulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.785" offset="2042546">And it felt that this weakness interfered with its maintaining or expanding its already very great share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.363" offset="2080789">Alcoa could have obtained a full line of course either by internal expansion, building its own facilities and acquiring the know-how or by a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.977" offset="2127287">It preferred a merger as easier, less expensive, quicker and is not merely as obnoxious to other companies in the wire and cable industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.042" offset="2175561">One of its officials, discussing the feeling of the industry, wrote a memorandum that's rather interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.005" offset="2207431">Acquisitions and mergers, he said, have the common denominator of not adding to existing capacity in the industry and everybody in the industry is very conscious of the fact that the entire industry would be much more healthy if each manufacturer were to talk about two -- were to toss about two thirds of its equipment into the Atlantic Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.589" offset="2301680">Rome, the acquired company, had begun business in the 1930s as a fabricator of copper conductor, wire and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.932" offset="2343058">It grew gradually and became one of the largest insulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.805" offset="2366568">Its business was -- became one of the largest companies in the combined fields but its business was very heavily in the insulated field.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.020" offset="2403453">Its technical skill, its research facilities, its reputation for know-how and ability in insulation had made it one of the outstanding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.841" offset="2458728">As the use of aluminum grew, Rome, naturally, moved into the aluminum field.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.352" offset="2488822">It was -- also it remained, I should say, a predominantly a copper fabricator.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.283" offset="2512541">The ratio according to a footage of line was about 25% aluminum in -- in dollar volume, the copper was 90% and the aluminum 10% as I recall.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="624.101" offset="2599790">Rome, in the bare aluminum field, was a very small percentage, less than 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.539" offset="2629569">In terms of the insulated aluminum conductors, Rome was 4.7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.568" offset="2661648">And as you see in the latter field, the insulated field, what the merger did was bring together the third and eighth ranking companies, giving them 16% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.103" offset="2711803">And if you put this, I shall argue, was appropriate for many purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.296" offset="2732596">The bare and insulated fields together, you find that the combined companies have just a tiny bit under 30% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.098" offset="2767809">The Department of Justice attacked the merger as a violation of Section 7 and the case was tried as the size of the record shows in some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.105" offset="2811800">The evidence covers many aspects of the aluminum business, especially aluminum wire and cable, but our focus is now confined to the sale of overhead aluminum conductors.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.561" offset="2869582">The Government's theory then and especially now that we have focused it is that the acquisition may tend substantially lessen competition in that area, overhead aluminum conductor, whether the market be defined as insulated aluminum conductors or simply as all overhead aluminum conductor both wire -- both bare and insulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.273" offset="2968430">And I shall talk about both in the relation between what my argument progresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.684" offset="2990059">The District Court ruled against the Government on all point, specifically, it held that neither insulated aluminum conductor nor all aluminum conductor, both bare and insulated, was an appropriate line of commerce for the purposes of Section 7, then the Court went on and held that the Government had failed to show that the merger might substantially lessen competition in either of those areas assuming that to be appropriate lines in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.045" offset="3131538">So our appeal brings here both the threshold questions concerning the line of commerce and also the question of substantial lessening of competition or rather I should say, a tendency substantially lessened competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.076" offset="3267688">We do, I should say, disagree with a considerable number of the characterizations and conclusions reached by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.834" offset="3310738">But I think it is fair to say, although perhaps not literally accurate, that the essence of our case here as in El Paso is that on the undisputed facts, it must be held, as a matter of law, that the acquisition violated Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.380" offset="3396942">On the threshold questions, whether insulated aluminum conductor or all aluminum conductor both bare and insulated for overhead use, is a proper line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.651" offset="3453994">The issue is rather narrowly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.977" offset="3467264">The parties agreed and the District Court held that it was proper to look -- to lump both bare and insulated conductors together as one line of commerce, speaking of both copper and aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.710" offset="3534242">And also, that it is proper to lump together and that also, it is proper to look at the insulated conductors separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.730" offset="3574262">The real question here, therefore, is whether aluminum and copper conductors must be lumped together in determining whether this acquisition may lessen competition in any line of commerce or whether aluminum, either taking all overhead conductors or taking only the insulated overhead conductor, belongs in one field and copper belongs in another separate field.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.069" offset="3691604">Even upon that narrow issue, it seems to me that the facts are essentially undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.276" offset="3716472">Functionally, either copper or aluminum can be used for insulated conductors.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.593" offset="3749700">It's also true that most industrial classifications speak of wire and cable companies or conductors or insulated conductors without distinguishing between those made of aluminum and those made of copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.810" offset="3822634">A number of companies make both.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.876" offset="3834859">Utilities use both, although by no means always interchangeably refer often for different purposes, although they can be used interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.204" offset="3876237">It is technically easy or technologically easy I should say, for a company that is using its equipment to make copper wire and to use it to make aluminum wire.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.468" offset="3925243">There is no serious problem in the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.489" offset="3945305">Those are the facts, of course, upon which the appellees very heavily rely and upon which the District Court rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.426" offset="3981040">What we emphasize is that in terms of cost for overhead uses, aluminum enjoys such a very marked advantage over copper that the two types of conductors are not competitive in any proper sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.721" offset="4058258">Purchasers make their choice solely on the basis of cost in this area, no matter of style or quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.269" offset="4096397">The price of insulated aluminum conductor is only 50% to 65% of the price of equally conductive copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.778" offset="4134536">Now, the initial shift from using exclusively copper to making some new installations of aluminum does involve collateral expenses because there's certain differences in technique in doing the work, certain different tools are needed and their problems of connecting aluminum to copper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1039.922" offset="4263058">Although I should say there has recently been a device invented which referred to in some of the testimony that very greatly diminishes that problem at least in the use of what they call "drop cable", it was running off from the street lines for the housing so that aluminum's advantage becomes even greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.860" offset="4342784">Despite these problems, it's quite clear that aluminum has such cost advantages for overhead use that it is practically pushing copper out of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.569" offset="4397641">As I said before, insulated aluminum cable was only 6% of the new installations in 1950, it was about 50%, 51.6% in 1955 and now, it's in excess of 77%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.030" offset="4471515">It just shows that for many, many purposes, there is no useful cost interrelationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.358" offset="4504848">And of course, the more aluminum that is strung, the less the collateral cost become and the problem of connecting will become and the greater should the aluminum's cost advantage assuming that other things remain equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.457" offset="4569213">Since the prices of copper and aluminum do not respond to each other and that is exceeded and since aluminum has this great cost advantage, the availability of copper is a functional substitute, can't meaningfully influence the behavior of insulated -- of companies in the insulated aluminum conductor field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.376" offset="4676838">And that is the crux of the matter from an antitrust point of few.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.983" offset="4703274">Putting it conversely, buyers of insulated aluminum would find little comfort in the functional substitutability of copper if the result of the increased concentration in the aluminum, insulated aluminum conductor market, where that quality deteriorated or didn't continue to improve or that prices were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.111" offset="4799822">We think, therefore, that this great difference resulting from differences in price, the reflected differences in cost justifies treating the two as different markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.371" offset="4856874">And the lower courts, in other cases cited in our brief, have quite generally recognized that where there is a marked difference in cost or price that even though the two are otherwise interchangeable, that it justifies the finding of -- as a separate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.243" offset="4940361">I may say that in arguing that aluminum is separate from copper, we do really no more than imply a usage that is been implied by the officials of both Alcoa and Rome and by others in the industry depressed to develop Alcoa in talking about negotiations with Rome, spoke of their importance in Alcoa's further development in the insulated aluminum wire and cable business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.032" offset="5063450">And in another memorandum, he spoke of the number one spot in the aluminum conductor field distinguishing that from becoming a factor in the copper field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.438" offset="5117158">A sales executive at Rome wrote a memorandum expressing some thoughts and observations on the insulated aluminum market and another Alcoa official referring to the effective Kaiser's purchase placing them in severe jeopardy of a proper share of the aluminum cable market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.830" offset="5210676">Rome again expressed within a speech, spoke of the aluminum covered wire business and the vice president of Southwire Company, another company in the area, when he was questioned by Mr. Bergson replied, "Aluminum wasn't fighting with copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.796" offset="5302523">We, Southwire, were fighting for our position in the aluminum industry."</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.557" offset="5321644">So there's nothing strange or noble about our distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.131" offset="5343901">The -- the other market, which we think is important, is the position of aluminum overhead conductors taken as a whole, whether bare or insulated and I'll deal with that briefly after lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.663" offset="5417984">May it please the Court, just before the recess, I've called attention in fact that in addition to arguing that insulated aluminum conductors are an appropriate line of commerce, we also urge that all aluminum conductors for overhead use, both bare and insulated, should be regarded as an appropriate line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.243" offset="5524355">The chief objection, not the only one, but the chief objection to this, raised in the opinion of the District Court, was that it was not proper to separate aluminum from copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.187" offset="5576077">And as I have tried to show, it seems to us that that separation is not only proper but for this purpose, necessary and that when that objection falls then the objection to treating all aluminum conductors, both bare and insulated as a line of commerce, falls with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.712" offset="5662177">The appellees object to our use of figures for aluminum conductors generally, saying that it's a statistical trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.911" offset="5703032">Of course, there's no trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.427" offset="5713063">The figures for all aluminum conductors are -- are obviously composite figures and they're obviously figures for products that are not completely interchangeable in their use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.717" offset="5766248">Breaking them down, one finds, as I said before that Alcoa's share of the bare aluminum conductor market was over 32% at the time of acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.925" offset="5815045">Although, Rome was small that in the insulated aluminum conductor market, Alcoa had 11.6% and Rome had 4.7%.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.718" offset="6186193">And they say a stress, if that is one of the reasons for this acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.922" offset="6203016">But now, we say by the same token, their economic power either in the bare field or in the insulated field can best be judged but -- by what they are in both together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.070" offset="6259649">And the best measure we have of both together is these composite figures which credits like you might speak of the fruit or citrus fruit line depends ability to sell oranges and certainly if retails affected by whether each got lemons on the counter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.090" offset="6551698">The District Court appears to have been concerned that it could not find all conductors, aluminum or copper to be a line of commerce and also to regard aluminum conductors, either subdivision, as a line of commerce and faced with the feeling that it must be one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.184" offset="6656084">It shows to take the two together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.816" offset="6666637">Now, it seems to us that that is quite inconsistent with the teaching of Brown Shoe and the Philadelphia Bank case and indeed, earlier cases, that the Chief Justice very clearly pointed out in Brown Shoe that whereas for many purposes, one must define the market broadly to include all the reasonably interchangeable substitutes still within that broad market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.972" offset="6763290">There might very well be a number of economically significant submarkets and then he went on to point out that because Section 7 prohibits an acquisition that may substantially lessen competition in any line of commerce that one must locate each of the economically significant submarkets as well as the broad one and that if there was that prohibited effect in one of the economically significant submarkets, then it didn't matter whether in the broader market, there was an effect or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.679" offset="6906128">And this goes back at least as far as 278 U.S. in Van Camp &amp; Sons against the American Can Company, wherein a passage quoted by Justice Brennan in the Philadelphia Bank case, the Court said the phrase was comprehensive and means that if the forbidden effect or tendency is produced in anyone out of all the various lines of commerce, the words in any line of commerce literally are satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.994" offset="7647378">The -- but I -- but I come to that in just -- in just one moment because I do intend to call attention to those figures and I think it'll save a little time to fit them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.247" offset="7708400">We come here, as I say, to the question whether this acquisition may substantially lessen competition in overhead aluminum conductors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.513" offset="7757406">Our answer is that this is just such an acquisition as Section 7 was directed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.582" offset="7793664">That this isn't a peripheral matter, the next to a case like the Brown Shoe case, this is the very core of the trend that Section 7 was intended to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.287" offset="7840475">The House Committee Reports in describing the problem, said the outstanding characteristic of the merger movement that Section 7 was intended to arrest has been that of larger corporations buying out small companies rather than small companies getting together so that they could compete more directly with the large ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.663" offset="7921977">And the Senate Committee explained that the problem was as a larger corporation grows through a series of small acquisitions, its accretions of economic power are individually so minute as to make it difficult to use the Sherman Act against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.354" offset="7980805">And it proposed Section 7 as a preventative for that evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.679" offset="8002121">Now, the core of this case is that a very large firm in the number one spot, as its president said in the aluminum conductor field, has enhanced its power of buying -- by buying up one of the rather few substantial independence in a field in which economic power is already heavily concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.030" offset="8107447">It's -- I come to demonstrate those facts and I think it could be done very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.786" offset="8130539">It can hardly begin said that Alcoa, just prior to the merger, was in the number one spot in the aluminum conductor field taking the two together or that its acquisition eliminated a substantial independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.024" offset="8191457">Now, take first to fill in the details, the simple figure showing the sales of insulated aluminum conductor in the last year prior to the merger, that's on page 20, Mr. Justice Clark, which were the figures that you asked for a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.264" offset="8268466">You'll note that the top three companies, Kaiser, Anaconda and Alcoa had between them 55.3% of the insulated aluminum conductor with Alcoa being third.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.206" offset="8340146">Alcoa acquired the eighth ranking company Rome with 4.7% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.808" offset="8370552">Alcoa's share went up 40% and the share of the big three went up almost 10%, about 9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.159" offset="8424051">So much for insulated by itself because I suggested before, in view of the importance of a full line as we are told by the appellees, Alcoa's dominant position can hardly be judged by taking insulated alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.196" offset="8492178">Taking bare aluminum, which is -- would seem to be the nearest thing in a full line, one finds, and these figures are in the record but not in our brief, that Alcoa was first with 32.5% of bare aluminum, Kaiser was second, with 22% and Anaconda third with 15.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.765" offset="8598444">Rome share of bare aluminum was less than 1%, it was small in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.730" offset="8618297">But it's worth nothing that here, the three companies that had 55% of the insulated field are now the top three with 70% of the bare field and that Alcoa is here the first with almost a third of the market itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.078" offset="8695724">Then bearing in mind, the necessity of getting a composite picture because of the relationship between these two products and the necessity of the full line, we turn to the combined sales of insulated and bare which is set forth on page 19 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.058" offset="8783600">There you will see, and these perhaps are the most important figures, they say in big three, Alcoa this time in the lead with 27.8%, Kaiser with 23.1% and Anaconda with 15.8% or between the three, 65% of the market and Rome in the combined figures comes in as a substantial firm with 1.3% of the market give when -- so that when Alcoa and Rome are put together, you have 29.1% of the market in the hands of the single company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.647" offset="8953919">I suggest that even there, the cold figures hardly tell the whole story, that the power of Alcoa and the other dominant firms in the conductor field can't be fairly measured just by their shares, statistical share of the conductor field, without regard to the fact that they are the big integrated companies that dominate the whole industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.739" offset="9070320">And I would agree that whether it's a railroad or a steamship line, it doesn't matter but it's the fact that it's an integrated company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.004" offset="9095398">It would certainly be important to me if I were buying into the aluminum conductor area myself and I should suppose is, therefore, important from a public point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.885" offset="9134895">The point is that the added accretion in the aluminum conductor line of commerce for overhead use is an accretion to still larger concentrations that goes through the whole industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.574" offset="9185677">It is not insignificant, though not very important in this -- that in this area, Alcoa went out and bought the Cupples Manufacturing Company, another fabricator, not of wire but of aluminum sides and doors and things like that, another case under attack under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.630" offset="9269896">It said here that Alcoa can't be characterized as a leading or dominant firm because her share of these markets and other markets has been declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.639" offset="9325902">That's unquestionably true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.171" offset="9336038">It's declining, of course, because she's lost her monopoly because Kaiser and Reynolds were set up and she is now finding her place having lost her exclusive position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.829" offset="9390686">But we do submit that the fact that she once had a monopoly that she's now lost, doesn't give her any privilege to try to hold on to as much of the market as she can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.961" offset="9431228">While she's still a dominant firm, it doesn't except her from Section 7, she is surely subject to the same test that Kaiser or any other dominant firm would be having the position that Alcoa now has in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.639" offset="9493922">Not only does the present case seem to us to be typical of what Congress was thinking about as described by the Congressional Committees but I submit that it falls well within the previous decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.296" offset="9560586">In the Brown Shoe case, the Court held that for a shoe manufacturer, which was the fourth largest, to -- with about 4% of the market, to acquire a retail chain, it was something like 1.2% of the market, was a violation of Section 7 because of the amount of the market that would be foreclosed by the verdict of merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.019" offset="9675421">Now, here, looking only to insulated conductors and forgetting all the rest of our case, Alcoa had 11.6% of the market, almost three times the share of Brown and it acquired in a horizontal merger, a competitor with 4.7% of the market more than three times the share that Kinney had had the acquisition in Brown Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.696" offset="9790151">Here is there, the big company is getting bigger by an acquisition, which has the Chief Justice said of that in words equally applicable here, has no countervailing competitive, social or economic advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.302" offset="9852531">I can see only two differences between the Brown Shoe case and this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.739" offset="9878340">The shoe industry was fragmented if you'd recall with a multitude of small manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.474" offset="9905298">In these markets, there's already a concentration but surely that can't help the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.380" offset="9936854">Indeed, the Court said in the Philadelphia Bank case that if concentration is already great, the importance of preventing even slight increases in concentration and so preserving the possibility of eventually decreasing the concentration is correspondingly greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.972" offset="10011251">It could also be said well in the Brown Shoe case, there was a merger trend and here perhaps, there is no merger trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.523" offset="10045419">Our answers are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.875" offset="10054823">First, we already have the concentration that results from merger and the effect of being in motion toward that point that was made important at Brown Shoe can't be more significant than being already at the point as this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.202" offset="10128175">And the second answer which is that whether you call it a merger trend or not, this acquisition was part of a series of acquisitions in the aluminum conductor field and is parallel to -- by acquisitions in the copper field, which, of course, aren't before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.979" offset="10223261">Our second reason for objecting to the acquisition of an independent -- no, our first reason here for saying that this is governed by Section 7 is that the acquisition of an independent by a vast integrated producer eliminates the competition between the two without any compensating public advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.951" offset="10331199">Our second equally important objection is that it's the -- the successful independent fabricator which is the -- we think a vital creative force and energizing creative force in the industry and that its disappearance destroys something very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.787" offset="10422523">And there's no better example of that kind of company and its importance to an industry than Rome Cable was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.581" offset="10457736">It began in the 1930s with assets of about $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.928" offset="10483127">It grew almost wholly by its own expansion to a $24 million concern shortly before the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.373" offset="10520848">It was an aggressive competitor though not one that initiated price cuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.060" offset="10543626">It had a first rate sales organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.481" offset="10557315">It was one of the four fabricators equipped to roll its own ingot into rod so that it wouldn't be dependent upon the competing integrated companies to buy rod from them also, it wouldn't have to buy ingot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.065" offset="10615620">But the real way that it made its way, its name, its reputation was by its research, technical skill and very substantial innovations, a year prior to the merger that it bought a -- had built a $675,000 research facility carrying on this trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.367" offset="10728887">I wish I know how to describe adequately how important the position, the existence of those faculties of independent companies are and how much damage it seems to us it will be done if the vast integrated concerns were able to buy up independent like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.800" offset="10818539">It's not merely that the economy losses the advantage of having the big firm, put forth its own efforts into its own facilities, into developing its own skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.779" offset="10870471">It's that the independence, who today feel the competitive stimulus, begin to disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.730" offset="10902340">There, the fellows who live by their wits, not in any invidious sense, they can't make money on rod, they can't make money on ingot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.594" offset="10937762">They've got to build the best mousetrap in the old fashion sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.077" offset="10959705">And when one of them is superseded, that quality is very likely to disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.449" offset="10993142">That's one of the intangibles which Section 7, as pointed out in the Brown Shoe case, was intended to preserve for the American economy and community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.886" offset="11050924">Now, in their brief, Rome makes a number of -- not Rome, Alcoa makes a number of answers to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.418" offset="11085093">First, they say well, Rome was essentially a copper insulator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.543" offset="11109543">It was larger in copper than in aluminum but it was a substantial factor in the aluminum field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.415" offset="11140995">It passes my understanding how the elimination of a substantial factor in the aluminum field can be made any better by saying that this company was an independent fabricator of copper too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.211" offset="11196165">I don't know if it makes him much worse on this record, one couldn't say that it does but it certainly doesn't make it any better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.940" offset="11227094">Appellees also argued below and argued in their brief and the District Court found that the elimination of Rome wasn't very important because there was ease of access into the aluminum conductor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.607" offset="11293759">The Court pointed out that whereas in 1950 that -- well, first point out that Alcoa was the only producer of conductor in 1940 and that there were 12 producers of bare aluminum conductor in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.934" offset="11363140">I add that there are only 12 today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.058" offset="11375574">The simple fact, of course, is that 1940 was the period in which Alcoa was losing its monopoly in which bare aluminum conductor was taking over the transmission field and after that, the opportunities to get in apparently declined, at least the entries came to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.929" offset="11467107">The Court also said that in 1950, there were only -- there were only four producers of insulated conductor and that there were 29 in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.992" offset="11555297">But I suggest that those figures don't give an altogether accurate impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.510" offset="11573373">In the first place, only 11 of the 29 could claim as much as 1% of the aluminum conductor field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.154" offset="11612035">Second, there was a tremendous shift from insulated copper to insulated aluminum in the early part of the 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.604" offset="11653831">You will also recall, of course, the early 1950s where the period of the Korean War when allocations of rare -- of metals like copper and aluminum were being made and a considerable amount of aluminum was allocated as replacement for copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.263" offset="11724466">If you look at that stage, new firms searched into the field but those were temporary conditions that ceased to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.018" offset="11763440">There's no reason suppose that they will be repeated and what happened was hardly evidence of ease of access as it's shown by the fact that since 1955, only one firm has entered the market for aluminum conductor and four, had dropped out of the market which is --</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.182" offset="11940133">And I was going to suggest that while they unquestionably are there and while technologically speaking, there is claiming, no trouble and stopping, drawing copper and drawing aluminum that commercially entering the aluminum area is what certainly be very -- one thing very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.139" offset="12019963">And I say that for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.383" offset="12028949">One, you've already mentioned that Alcoa saw this enormous time, trouble and expenditure facing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.983" offset="12063326">Now, one can't claim that other companies who are making copper would all have just the same troubles as Alcoa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.947" offset="12091120">But I think the very great trouble that Alcoa foresaw is evidence that other companies would face or shall I say, parallel and troubled by their own particular difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.453" offset="12137200">And of course, the reason among others is certainly that what's technologically possible isn't always commercially possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.401" offset="12172936">I -- and what -- to consider shifting in any quantity from copper to aluminum would require all kinds of difficult decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.528" offset="12213478">One of them, just to mention one, do you want to give up your established relationship with the copper suppliers and take on the, perhaps, doubtful business of being dependent for your source of supply on the integrated concerns with whom you will be having to compete?</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.082" offset="12627675">And of course, if one reads the record carefully here, there are many suggestions that the Alcoa people saw other more sophisticated constructions of wire than the insulated wire as an opportunity in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.694" offset="12694131">And they picked up a small magnet wire company, rewire company in order to get into that avenue which they hadn't been in before whereas here, of course, they had been competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.125" offset="12759855">I think, I've already commented adequately on these 200 concerns waiting in the wings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.732" offset="12794337">In the first place, they've all stayed in the wings since 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.045" offset="12815548">Alcoa's difficulties in entering the area while -- suggest that they too would have very great difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.590" offset="12849716">There's always a drag on moving from one area into another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.456" offset="12869151">And finally, I suggest that speculation about what copper companies might do to fill the place of Rome in the aluminum field is simply not an adequate answer to the demonstrated increase in concentration and the disappearance of this very important independent concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.433" offset="12965073">Now, that brings me to our final reason for arguing that this merger and any other acquisition like it, violates Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.215" offset="13020244">Each acquisition by a major integrated firm like Alcoa is very likely to prove a step in the progressive elimination of significant independent firms in an industry resulting in each capture by the giant integrated companies and a progression that can't be stopped unless you stop the individual merger that says violations of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.666" offset="13130062">Now, the facts here speak very eloquently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.099" offset="13143751">In February 1957, Kaiser, which, of course, had been coming up rapidly as you'll -- and had a large share of its market, acquired the wire and mill division of the United States Rubber Company, that was a division that made insulated conductors and had a good share although not a great share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.778" offset="13226506">Kaiser had sold 18% of the insulated aluminum conductor and U.S. Rubber, 3.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.445" offset="13257122">That merger was one of the factors which led to Alcoa's acquiring Rome and Alcoa officially wrote to one of his colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.197" offset="13292126">Kaiser's purchase of U.S. Rubber's wire and cable division only accentuates our position and will in the future, I believe, places in severe jeopardy of a proper share of the aluminum conductor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.397" offset="13344998">In May 1957, Olin Mathieson, which through our may is an integrated aluminum company, bought Southern Electrical which made 8% of the sales of aluminum conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.340" offset="13404766">Olin wasn't previously in the field but this again is part of the trend of the giant fabricated -- giant integrated company to acquire fabricators as outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.384" offset="13452936">And another Alcoa executive, commenting on the proposed measure -- merger with Rome said that Kaiser-U.S. Rubber deal and the Olin Mathieson-Southern Electrical combination seemed to be the most industry racking announcements and certainly the most threatening to Alcoa's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.368" offset="13532871">Rome Cable is by far the best acquisition, in my opinion, that Alcoa could hope to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.358" offset="13556799">The step would be the answer to the present Kaiser threat to push Alcoa out of first place in the electrical conductor field, then Alcoa acquired Rome nor was that the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.124" offset="13611865">As soon as Alcoa acquired Rome, Reynolds Metals began to get worried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.973" offset="13639241">And in a discussion that their executives had shortly later in January 1959, on the minutes reigned, since Alcoa's acquisition of Rome Cable Company last week, now lives Reynolds as the only major aluminum or copper company without insulating facilities, it's expected that our sale of metal with electrical applications will suffer, if some action is not taken to enlarge our wire and cable product line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.512" offset="13761390">Reynolds apparently didn't have the money at that time to buy someone as the notes show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.350" offset="13784795">But in May 1961, Reynolds bought the wire and cable facilities of Roebling, which had been a company with an excellent reputation in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.840" offset="13826696">And after the record closed in this case, Aluminum of Canada acquired an insulating company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.754" offset="13858356">So, as I suggest that one of these steps does in fact lead to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.552" offset="13885628">That as the Chief Justice said in Brown Shoe, Congress saw the process of concentration as a dynamic force then it sought to assure that the courts and the Federal Trade Commission would have power to break the force at the outset and before it gathered momentum and we brought suits attacking the Kaiser merger as well as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.433" offset="13977057">It seems to me that unless one loses sight of the thrust of Section 7 in a mess of technical wrangling over the definition of the market ease of access and other tools that ought to be kept serving to the main purpose, surely, these cases, the Kaiser one, this one that I've mentioned, are typical instances of the mergers prohibited by Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.270" offset="14088443">What Congress was worried about was that the large concerns with these series of acquisitions, as I said at the beginning, about which there can be quite a lot of argument perhaps in the individual instance as here about ease of access and the like, other added competitive effects would not be enough to make out a violation of the Sherman Act and that it passed this law to prevent that kind of accelerated concentration of economic power, not only on economic grounds but also because of the threat to other values in a trend toward concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.274" offset="14256462">This acquisition, we submit, of a significant independent by a vast integrated company, without any offsetting on social, economic or competitive values, violates the very core of the policy embodied in Section 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="3803.619" offset="15317870">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.488" offset="15341275">This acquisition of Rome Cable Company by Alcoa took place in 1959 and was originally attacked by the Government in 10 lines of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.207" offset="15420165">The District Court held that in all 10 lines of commerce, the Government had neither -- either or not established the lines of commerce or had failed to show a probable substantial lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.451" offset="15493204">Now, among the lines of commerce that the Government had in the District Court and which they are not urging in this Court, other vertical aspects of this case, they alleged in the District Court that by virtue of this acquisition, competing aluminum suppliers would be foreclosed from supplying Rome as a market for aluminum -- aluminum ingot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.682" offset="15602082">It was also alleged that there would be a diminution of competition and a foreclosure in the furnishing of rod, which is the basic material on which aluminum wire and cable -- aluminum rod to the basis -- basic material from which aluminum wire and cable is drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.224" offset="15688286">In these vertical lines of commerce, the District Court held against the Government and the Government has not appealed, so that there is no question in this case now about Alcoa's integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.490" offset="15749308">This case has now become a case involving wire and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.441" offset="15777102">There is no such thing as the foreclosure of manufacturers as there was in the competing manufacturers, as there was in the Brown Shoe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.676" offset="15810121">This case is horizontal and horizontal only now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.859" offset="15830810">Now, on appeal, the Government has relied on two lines of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.837" offset="15866755">One, insulated aluminum wire and cable, which the District Court found not to be a line of commerce and two, aluminum insulated wire and cable which the District Court also found not to be a line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.938" offset="15951078">Insulated aluminum wire and cable is a combination of bare aluminum wire and cable, a line of commerce which we admitted in the District Court because there, there was no competition with copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.769" offset="16042402">Their specialized know-how was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.855" offset="16058807">Their aluminum had virtually replaced copper in the transmission of electrical energy and there, there was a recognized industry of producers of aluminum bare wire and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.332" offset="16140727">The Court found that in that line of commerce, even though we admitted it that there was no adverse effect because in that line of commerce, Alcoa with 32.5% of the market, acquired Rome with three tenths of a percent of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.681" offset="16214079">And the Court held that this, in the light of all other economic factors which I will come to later, was too insubstantial as to constitute a substantial lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.777" offset="16266428">Now, the Government's second line of commerce here, the insulated or the aluminum wire and cable line of commerce is nothing more, despite what the Solicitor General has said, a numerical trick to add Alcoa's high figures, admittedly high figures, in their aluminum to their relatively low figures in insulated aluminum to come up with a line of commerce that would might bring this case within the test of Philadelphia National Bank because you get to close to 30%.</text>

            <text syncTime="4080.061" offset="16423581">Well, Mr. Bergson, do you -- you -- I gather that Solicitor General said that if he didn't make out on just insulated aluminum as a line of commerce that he probably couldn't make out on bare and aluminum -- bare and insulated together, didn't he?</text>

            <text syncTime="4095.696" offset="16486170">Well, that's -- I think that's quite right, Your Honor, but I think we have -- we have an additional problem because assuming that -- well, if he doesn't make out on -- on insulated because they have an appeal and there is no case and that -- there's -- there's no charge of substantial lessening competition and I think it is true that -- that if he doesn't make out on an insulator, he cannot add the two together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.212" offset="16592227">And he said that this -- this was the -- this was the -- the reason that the District Court didn't lump them together because he said the District Court said, "You can't lump insulated and copper wire and cable with bare aluminum wire and cable."</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.295" offset="16672580">But the Court did not base it's conclusion on a statement of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.180" offset="16700061">The Court made a finding of fact which said that aluminum conductor wire and cable excludes insulated copper products and therefore, it does not include all wire and cable products for which there is reasonable interchangeability of use or cross-elasticity of demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.363" offset="16772786">And then he goes on to say, "In addition, the evidence fails to establish that the combination of bare and insulated aluminum wire and cable considered as a whole is generally recognized in the industry as a separate mark -- economic entity or submarket."</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.371" offset="16848854">Now, the Court's finding was based on the fact that these two products, bare aluminum wire and cable and insulated aluminum wire and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.473" offset="16905279">In addition to constituting separate markets are so -- so completely different from one another that it would be impossible to include within the same line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.164" offset="16948015">And I would like at this time, if -- if I may, just to show the Court what we're talking about here in some of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.381" offset="16984900">This is bare aluminum, ACSR.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.226" offset="17012276">This is used in the transmission of electrical energy from the generating station to the distribution station.</text>

            <text syncTime="4239.400" offset="17060968">Insulated copper is not used at all in the transmission of electrical energy -- I mean an insulated aluminum is not used at all in the transmission of electrical energy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4679.070" offset="18819636">Now, in addition to these products that I have shown you, Rome made products such as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.348" offset="18876792">These are power cables and control table -- cables with many conductors insulated within insulated conductors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.723" offset="18914304">They are the most sophisticated types of conductors that are possible to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.960" offset="18935202">And it was this skill and ability that Alcoa was looking for when it acquired Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.374" offset="19036871">The -- the District Court made an explicit finding on this subject and I think it's -- it's where the -- I'm reading to you our finding number 7, where the Court said Alcoa's purpose in acquiring Rome was to acquire the ability to manufacture the more complicated insulated wire and cable products and to diversify its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.634" offset="19141883">Rome's manufacture of aluminum products did not induce said acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.094" offset="19187754">What Alcoa was interested in in acquiring Rome was the ability to acquire these insulating skills that Rome had that Alcoa did not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.862" offset="19242820">And in order to have a full line of products, not in aluminum, but a full line of products, copper, that they could offer their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.043" offset="19303528">Now, it is true that as -- as Mr. Cox said that Alcoa was virtually the sole supplier of ACSR and bare aluminum prior to World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.358" offset="19364760">During this period, there was practically no demand for insulated aluminum wire and cable products because it was all being furnished in copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.238" offset="19424319">Alcoa gave some thought to it but it went to existing insulators and suggested to these insulators that they might experiment with aluminum as a conductor instead of copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.994" offset="19487326">With the advent of the Korean War, however, and copper became short, the demand for aluminum increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.680" offset="19542079">And when this demand increased, those who were previously making copper insulated products very quickly turned to insulating aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.700" offset="19594219">They made it on the same machinery, they made it with the same personnel, they sold it to the same customers to whom they were selling it before and they sold it with the same sales personnel that they were selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.739" offset="19658376">As this developed, Alcoa was asked by its customers if they wouldn't supply insulated aluminum wire and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.671" offset="19698082">And Alcoa lacked the know-how to do this, even to construct these simple insulated products that they subsequently made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.407" offset="19741027">Alcoa had dealt with Rome and Alcoa turned to Rome and said, "We would like to go into the insulating business, can you give us the know-how and show us how to do it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.839" offset="19778748">And Rome said, "Well, we got a better idea, why don't you let us insulate for you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.535" offset="19805497">So a tolling arrangement was worked out whereby Alcoa supplied the wire and Rome supplied the insulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.574" offset="19849697">In the meantime, while all of this was going on, Alcoa's position in aluminum wire and cable bare declined precipitously.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.550" offset="19909569">In 1954, Alcoa's position in ACSR was 48.4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.916" offset="19947081">In 1956, it was 30%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.658" offset="19974040">Now, as a result of this, Alcoa felt the need to diversify its product and to diversify into copper, who was already making or selling aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.126" offset="20031927">So that they turned to Rome and suggested acquisition to Rome and Rome refused to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.978" offset="20083336">Alcoa wasn't interested in Rome's bare aluminum obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.816" offset="20106637">It didn't need Rome's capacity for aluminum insulated wire and cable, they already had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.385" offset="20144880">But what they needed was the copper products and the know-how and the -- and the diversification that the proper -- products would've given.</text>

            <text syncTime="5034.545" offset="20241533">But Rome was essentially a copper producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.135" offset="20259924">95 -- 90% to 95% the Court found of its production was devoted to copper facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.643" offset="20293987">It was highly skilled, as I said, in the -- in these very sophisticated insulating products.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.333" offset="20344665">Rome was not an insulator -- an innovator in aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.645" offset="20365981">Rome hadn't done anything in aluminum except make it when the demand came for it in world war -- in the Korean War.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.680" offset="20398059">The Government in its brief suggests that Rome was an innovator in aluminum products and they point out that Rome invented the multiplex cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.973" offset="20443303">Oh, they didn't invent the multiplex cable but they invented the multiplex cable in 1948 in copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.303" offset="20472560">And then when they started making aluminum, they readily adopted their -- their equipment and their machinery and their personnel and do the making of the same product in aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.547" offset="20529612">Now, when Rome turned Alcoa down, Alcoa was faced with the problem how to go forward in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.336" offset="20576737">They could've done one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.308" offset="20584573">They could've gone on their own, as the Solicitor General accept -- had suggested, or they could look for another company to acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.837" offset="20618742">Well, they looked into doing it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.252" offset="20636400">And in order to get the type of insulating material that they wanted, which had no relation to aluminum conductor wire and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.828" offset="20670673">The type that they could get for Rome would've cost them $35 to $40 million and as the District Court found would've taken them 5 to 10 years to acquire the know-how and if that -- and even at the end of 10 years, they would be 10 years behind their -- the -- the present insulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.729" offset="20754265">Now, again, they reached the decision that they would try to acquire another company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.770" offset="20798464">They went and they looked at six other companies, not one of them had any interest in aluminum to speak of at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.485" offset="20833364">Their sole interest in -- was in the insulating capacity and they were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.549" offset="20869517">They then turned to Rome again and they succeeded in making the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.806" offset="20894595">And this is what this lawsuit is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.085" offset="20907760">Now, the record shows and the Court found that Alcoa was not interested in Rome's aluminum production at all that it was not seeking a captive market for aluminum, that it was not in seeking to increase its capacity for aluminum and that it was not for the purpose of securing a competitive advantage over anyone in aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.063" offset="21027610">And they were not concerned with Rome's competition in aluminum because the record shows that within a two-year period prior to the merger, Alcoa lost five hundredths of 1% of aluminum business to Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.149" offset="21111933">And the record also shows that Rome was not a price cutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.748" offset="21138369">Furthermore, this is a case where not a single competitor was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.032" offset="21163551">The Government brought forward witness after witness from the industry and those witnesses testified that the acquisition had not hurt them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.026" offset="21215483">Some of them testified that they didn't expect that the acquisition would hurt them in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.921" offset="21239097">No one testified that he expected that the acquisition would hurt him in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.396" offset="21264906">And we brought in 8 of the 10 common customers who bought from both Alcoa and Rome and every one of those 8 testified that the loss of Rome did not hurt them in their purchasing of this -- of these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.505" offset="21349439">Now, this I think is -- is part of the background of this case that -- that is -- is fairly important when you consider the -- the legal problems that arise as the result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.317" offset="21416626">Now, the first question and of course, the -- the threshold question here is the line of commerce question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.388" offset="21452884">Now, what do we have to determine in line of commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.228" offset="21476289">We've got to find the area of effective competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.855" offset="21494784">If the area is defined too broadly, then the -- the law cannot work its force.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.446" offset="21541177">If the area is defined too narrowly, the -- the application of the percentages in various factors are unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.228" offset="21600319">Now, underneath this problem, this Court in Brown Shoe worked out certain indicia for the purpose of testing not only the broad markets but the submarkets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.813" offset="21646608">One of these indicia was industry recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.915" offset="21659042">Now, I'm talking about insulated wire and cable products now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.816" offset="21678686">Aluminum and copper together, not aluminum on the one hand and copper on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.075" offset="21707630">The Court found and the evidence sustained it that the industry right here is the insulating industry and not insulators of copper on the one hand and insulators of aluminum on the other hand, but insulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.214" offset="21788191">This is how the census characterizes and classifies this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.162" offset="21812015">It's the insulating industry, not the copper industry, copper insulating industry or the aluminum industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.459" offset="21853184">The people in the business themselves consider themselves as insulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.568" offset="21893622">They don't designate their product as copper line wire or aluminum line wire.</text>

            <text syncTime="5590.705" offset="22466226">You're not dealing with someone coming in off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.117" offset="22479809">So you've got the same customer, the same supplier, the same machinery and in addition to that, you have a product that will do exactly the same thing whether it be aluminum or copper because they perform exactly the same function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.157" offset="22571969">Now, the Government concedes all this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.224" offset="22584299">And they say, "It doesn't matter because there is no price sensitivity between aluminum and copper."</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.524" offset="22617422">So that of the seven Brown Shoe indicia, you forget five of them and you rely solely on price sensitivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.757" offset="22662353">But this overlooks the supply indicia and the supply substitution problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.459" offset="22705194">In order to comprise a market, and I mean a narrow submarket for antitrust purposes, it seems to me, if you make product (a) and there is product (b) and product (b) competes effectively for the same use and are price sensitive, you have -- both of those products must be in the line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.671" offset="22814072">But in addition to that, it seems to me that in the line of commerce, you also must include capacity, the ability to supply because if you have product (a) and somebody else who makes product (b) can supply product (a) at the drop of a hat, he must be included in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.674" offset="22926085">So that when you have this interchangeability of equipment, the same buyers, the same sellers and a product capable of doing the same thing and the ability to switch from the copper to the aluminum, this price sensitivity test gets lost or should get lost when all of the other indicia of the submarket are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.949" offset="23047189">Now, when I say isn't just our theory because the record in this case is very, very graphic on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5743.212" offset="23076237">One of the Government's witness was asked by me when he first started to make aluminum insulated wire and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.782" offset="23114480">And he said when I got -- when I -- when the customer first asked me to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.331" offset="23148648">Another witness in this test -- in this case said, "We don't care what the customer -- what we supply, we are supplying the customer wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.395" offset="23192952">If he asks us for aluminum, we'll give it to him in aluminum, if he wants it in copper, we'll give it to him in copper, if he wants it in bronze, we'll give it to him in bronze.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.294" offset="23232554">We are insulators and we will supply the customer whatever he wants."</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.853" offset="23262751">But -- now, this also, I think, is buttressed by the fact that in the Korean War situation, when -- when copper became short, the number of producers of aluminum wire and cable went from 4 to 29 practically overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.132" offset="23347911">You don't have to go out and -- and -- there wasn't anything that inhibited them from shifting from copper to aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.310" offset="23396603">Now -- so, it seems to me that this supply oriented indicia is, if I -- if I may use that term, definitely compels that the -- in -- that the line of commerce be the insulated line of commerce and that all people capable of insulating be within that line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.361" offset="23504854">Now, this is happening today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5856.854" offset="23530768">The record in this case showed that in 1959, the General Electric Company went from practically nothing in 1958 to 1.5% of this insulated aluminum market in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.454" offset="23589177">And that the Circle Company, a subsidiary of -- of Cerro went from 0% to 1% in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.250" offset="23636407">And the capacity for copper, according to the record, is 20 times that the capacity for aluminum and to leave that out of this market and judge this case solely on shares of so-called insulated aluminum conductor market, in my judgment, ignores competitive realities.</text>

            <text syncTime="6697.848" offset="26894712">The other line of commerce that the Government contends for is aluminum conductor wire and cable and that includes the bare and the insulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.191" offset="26956152">This, it seems to me, is nothing more than an effort, as I said before, to try to get these percentages within the Philadelphia National Bank percentages because Alcoa was admittedly high in the bare where the Government does not contend that there has been any lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6734.851" offset="27042774">And Alcoa was a poor third in -- in insulated, where the Government concedes that the percentages alone are not enough to establish a violation of -- of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="6759.052" offset="27139532">Now, so far as effects are concerned, it seems to me that in order to determine effects, there has to be a private searching analysis of market facts except in the -- perhaps in the Philadelphia National Bank situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6784.586" offset="27241723">But in the insulated line of commerce, which the Government is talking, and let's assume that the Government prevails on aluminum insulated line of commerce, Alcoa is not, as the Government stated in its question presented, the largest producer of insulated wire and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6804.464" offset="27321240">Alcoa was third and it was a poor third because Kaiser had 26% and Anaconda had 16% and Alcoa had 11%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.791" offset="27394487">They -- they -- when they acquired Rome, added 4% -- 4.7% which gave them a total of 16.3%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6833.099" offset="27435760">Now, there has been nothing suggested in any writing by this Court or by any of the economists that 16.3% alone is sufficient to be determinative of a substantial lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.521" offset="27501484">And in a case such as this -- such as this, concentration ratios, percentages mean nothing because here, there's complete ease of entry as I said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6865.768" offset="27566477">There are no cost advantages, no product differentiation, no economies of scale, no uncertainties so far as the new entrant is concerned and no time lag.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.746" offset="27618408">And there are significant companies waiting in the wings, as Mr. Cox mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6885.160" offset="27644008">There are 200 companies, the Court found, capable of doing this and those companies includes such companies as General Electric, Westinghouse, the United States Steel, Phelps-Dodge, Kennecott Wire and Cable Company, Cerro de Pasco, all very, very substantial companies and there is no reason in the world to believe that if market conditions were such, so that if Alcoa with its market position try to dominate, tried to raise prices, ceased being an innovator and laid back that these companies would not come pouring into this industry and completely decentralizing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6938.207" offset="27856227">And in addition to that, even after the acquisition, Alcoa's share of this insulated wire and -- aluminum wire and cable market has declined since the acquisition and had 13 -- 16.3% in 1958 and 13% in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="6963.858" offset="27958836">And this increased percentage or decreased percentage in Alcoa went to the non-integrated fabricators because the record shows that the non-integrated fabricators presently in aluminum wire and cable, increased their percentage from 29% of the market to over 33% of the market during the period of 1959 and 1960 -- 1958 to 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="6993.762" offset="28078373">They expanded their facilities, some -- some of them doubled their capacity and not one of them claimed that this acquisition had any adverse effect on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7008.629" offset="28137932">Now, in addition to these factors that I have just discussed, the Court in Brown Shoe referred to other factors that should be considered in -- in considering a merger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.861" offset="28206791">One purpose, what was Alcoa's purpose here?</text>
            <text syncTime="7030.600" offset="28225808">Alcoa's purpose was not to lessen competition, to enhance its power in any so-called line of commerce that the Government is relying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="7040.166" offset="28264051">Alcoa's purpose was to obtain insulating know-how and to diversify its product line.</text>
            <text syncTime="7057.043" offset="28331551">The other point that the Court discussed in Brown Shoe was merger trends.</text>
            <text syncTime="7062.746" offset="28354330">The Court in this case found that there was no significant merger trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="7068.773" offset="28378467">The merger between Southern Electric and Olin Mathieson was a situation where Southern -- Olin Mathieson not in a wire and cable business at all, acquired a company to get into the wire and cable business, not just aluminum wire and cable business but the whole gamut of wire and cable business.</text>
            <text syncTime="7091.052" offset="28467597">And the record shows that after they acquired and they lost position.</text>
            <text syncTime="7096.871" offset="28490898">And -- and Kaiser acquired Bristol not because they needed any support in aluminum wire and cable because they already had 26% of the insulated wire and cable market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7110.258" offset="28544397">They were interested in the copper, the complicated know-how, so that they could offer a diversification of products and Alcoa did it for the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="7124.028" offset="28599463">Does this portend a future trend towards merger?</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.294" offset="28616600">The record shows no.</text>
            <text syncTime="7130.239" offset="28624332">The Court found that it did not and Alcoa testified when -- when asked as to whether or not it was going to acquire another company in this field, its executive vice president said, "No, we already got what we've wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7150.235" offset="28704266">We've got the know-how and we're not going -- we're not about to buy it twice."</text>
            <text syncTime="7155.341" offset="28724746">So that there is no purpose here such as there was in Brown Shoe to dry up outlets or to -- to enhance market position in the so-called aluminum wire and cable -- wire and cable product.</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.950" offset="28787127">The purpose was to be able to serve -- for Alcoa to be able to serve its customers as well as its competitors were able to serve it because its competitors were all able to offer wire and cable products.</text>
            <text syncTime="7186.866" offset="28850866">Now, just one other thought, the Government in its brief suggests that there should be a simplified test for deciding merger cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7203.841" offset="28918784">And therefore, when you -- when you have the -- the largest and it acquires some percentage no matter how small it is if -- if you get up within a certain range, the -- the merger should automatically be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="7221.959" offset="28991195">And they say that the reason for that is that businessmen need certainty and the Government needs certainty and that they want to avoid long complicated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7230.804" offset="29026617">Well, in the first place, this case was not a long complicated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7235.045" offset="29043545">We tried this case in 15 days and in those 15 days, we discussed 9 -- 10 lines of commerce, not just the two that are here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7248.213" offset="29096208">And I think that we were able to develop a record so that a realistic determination can be made as to whether or not this acquisition has any anticompetitive effects and not a situation where you have to rely on mere numbers alone where the numbers we demonstrate -- we -- we suggest are meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="7271.778" offset="29190457">And even -- even if you could use numbers in this case, you still would not have eliminated the question of what constituted the line of commerce because the numbers mean only -- mean something only if you have a well-defined line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="7285.995" offset="29247404">And here, you have no line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="7288.647" offset="29257958">You have a dispute as to the line of commerce, so that there would be no opportunity whatsoever for the businessman to apply a simplified test here because how is the businessman going to know how the Government is going to draw the line of commerce and then apply its numbers?</text>
            <text syncTime="7306.801" offset="29330578">So that I suggest that -- that the only way that a Section 7 case can be treated, a case of this kind and I think this case is -- is somewhat unique, is that you must examine it all in -- in the light of all the facts and I submit that this is what the District Court did and the District Court made well reason, fought for comprehensive findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7335.548" offset="29445517">And as a result of those findings of fact, came of the conclusion that this acquisition did not lessen competition and I submit that Your Honors -- ask Your Honors to affirm.</text>
