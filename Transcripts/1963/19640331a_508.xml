            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105694">Number 508, Andres Lucas et al., Appellants, versus The Forty-Fourth General Assembly of the State of Colorado et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.498" offset="163686">Mr. Cramer, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. George Louis Creamer</label>
            <text syncTime="20.455" offset="187510">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.885" offset="205168">The instinct case is a case which arises with reference to State legislative apportionment in the State of Colorado and follows a succession of some six cases which I believe the Court heard in November this year in a series of arguments then.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.376" offset="303180">In order to explain the problem so that it is coherent, it perhaps would be well to explain briefly the history of apportionment in Colorado and the history of this particular case judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.342" offset="386981">Colorado has the convenience of an almost finite starting point in history which is its starting point in apportionment as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.320" offset="446958">It was first, for all practical purposes established in 1859 by the discovery of gold along three creek systems in the near vicinity of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.881" offset="509129">The backwash of the Colorado, the California gold rush populated it quite rapidly with the allure of that metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.894" offset="545178">It existed almost non-governmentally from 1859 to 1861, but in 1861 there was passed a territorial statute, creating a territory of Colorado out of what had previously been the territories or portions of the territories of Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico and Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.560" offset="647892">When the state or the territory was first created, there was created a legislative council under the territorial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.876" offset="689165">The legislative council consisted of two houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.450" offset="707451">Those two houses were a council and an assembly, very much in parallel to the present House of Representatives and the present Senate which constitute the general assembly of the state of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.680" offset="772339">The first body, the smaller, the council, was described or prescribed to consist of from 9 to 13 members, and the second body from 13 to 26 members to be selected upon the basis of an apportionment on population as nearly equal as maybe, that phrase is nearly as maybe, occurring in the document itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.677" offset="900339">The units which were used were a system of divisions which closely approximated to our original county divisions, the state being as a territory identical with the present state boundaries, but being divided into fewer than a dozen county units, each obviously of rather monumental physical size for that particular period.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.346" offset="1019039">The Civil War intervened in development of the state further and immediately after the civil war, in 1866 there was enacted by the Congress and steps were taken pursuant to it by the people of Colorado, an Enabling Act to permit the organization of the state of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.696" offset="1132411">President Johnson vetoed that act for reasons -- the nature of which I do not historically remember, but don't bear particularly on apportionment in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.781" offset="1188731">Following the veto of the act and until the year 1874, the state continued in the same territorial fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.889" offset="1221227">In 1874 Congress enacted an enabling Act and by 1876 the state was established as a state and obtained its name, a sentential state for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.842" offset="1277025">It continued under a Constitution, legislatively in much the same fashion that it had existed in the territorial scheme of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.855" offset="1333031">It had House of Representatives and it had the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.193" offset="1350376">These initially were distributed, the Constitution sets out the districts, in roughly or set out the districts, they have been repealed since the first Constitution did, set out the districts essentially in the same manner the old council and house districts had been set out theretofore, established on a population basis primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.886" offset="1441178">There were three --</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="335.137" offset="1446194">Does the Constitution require that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_louis_creamer" startTime="337.970" stopTime="1340.829">
            <label>Mr. George Louis Creamer</label>
            <text syncTime="337.970" offset="1457478">Yes, the Constitution didn't require it on a population basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.688" offset="1476391">I am just reaching that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.799" offset="1484855">The Constitution had in Article 5, Sections 45, 46 and 47, a provision on the method in which there was to be apportionment thereafter if used the initial districts essentially as they have existed territorially and those were population based.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.455" offset="1575447">But then in Section 45 it said essentially, page 6 of the memo contains the -- our brief contains the section, that the general assembly provided by law -- shall provide by law an enumeration of inhabitance of the state in the year of our law 1885 and decennially there after.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.663" offset="1660293">It provided also that every, at the session next following that enumeration, that is the state decennial enumeration which takes place in the fifth year of the decennium rather than in the first year as the Federal one does, after that enumeration and after each Federal apportionment, Federal enumeration as well, Federal censes, there must be an enumeration of the Senate at the next session following enumeration made by the authority of the United States shall revise and adjust the apportionment for senators and representatives on the basis of such enumeration according to ratios to be fixed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.624" offset="1820163">So that we were supposed to have an apportionment in accordance with population every five years according to the scheme the Constitution sets out.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.238" offset="1858615">This scheme is rather remarkable among American Constitutional schemes in that it has been entirely ignored from its beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.082" offset="1889962">There has never been a state censes in Colorado, nobody ever took one and therefore there has not been an enumeration every five years because the wherewithal every five year enumeration simply did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.108" offset="1954118">There have been gestures towards enumeration or reapportionment made every ten years, when someone didn't forget.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.961" offset="2005527">There was one done in 1880 but that was before the 1885 provision was first in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.486" offset="2035621">There was one done in 1901, there was one done approximately 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.297" offset="2062788">There were two of them done in the 30s.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.811" offset="2072923">There was one of them done in approximately 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.445" offset="2095389">Those in the 30s led to a miserable (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="502.197" offset="2114406">The legislature viewing the fact that there had been a marked population departure from the mountains towards the plains area did reapportion and had in mind exactly what no one knows but it followed, its reapportionment followed a popularly initiated reapportionment which was violently in conflict with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.899" offset="2233211">The Supreme Court of the state of Colorado pointed out in that case that the legislative apportionment was almost certainly unconstitutional because it gave to areas not entitled to representatives, representatives entitled on a population basis that was the basis the Court indicated and otherwise it breached the matter generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.511" offset="2323699">The 1955 reapportionment which was the only one really to attempt to be done after the 1930s did nothing effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.966" offset="2373541">It changed Denver by one representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.256" offset="2386706">It made almost no changes in the Senate and it accomplished no change where they have mentioned except that it possibly was a gesture of good faith towards the principle at least it was attempted to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.601" offset="2444071">The legislature, before they met only every two years in any kind of plenary session.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.280" offset="2474791">It now meets once a year, but it's sessions in the even numbered year are limited to budgetary matters and such matters as the Governor places before it, particularly in his call.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.972" offset="2521498">However, following the 1960 census, the legislature was in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.494" offset="2543650">It was in session at the time 1960 census was prepared and it was in session the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.880" offset="2573116">At each of these calls the governor did mention to the assembly the fact of the census and transmitted to it copies of the document which we have filed as an appendix to the brief, the census tracked, but nothing was done about apportionment, absolutely nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.829" offset="2645005">Now at this stage, some litigation was instituted by parties other than those now before the Court before the Colorado Supreme Court asking that it take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.703" offset="2704460">Those decisions have no direct relation to the proceeding here, but should historically be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.713" offset="2732463">The Colorado Supreme Court recognized that apportionment was in some what historic case within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.835" offset="2764959">There was a marked split in the Court on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.989" offset="2785648">All of it agreed that some of the apportionment was necessary, portion of it did not mention, the majority, did not mention the Fourteenth Amendment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.889" offset="2825250">It overlooked that point rather pronouncedly and it simply said that it would wait and see what the legislature did.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.851" offset="2869031">It didn't do anything and then the remainder of the Court in quite vigorous terms denounced the whole situation as a violent departure from the criterion required under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.022" offset="2929740">Since nothing had been done action was instituted by a group of some 15 or 16 persons, residents of the counties of Denver, Adams Jefferson, and Arapahoe immediately surrounding Denver which are worst discriminated areas though there are others as we point out that are very bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.560" offset="3007898">In the District Court, the Court pursuant to request convolved the statutory Court of three Judges and that Court commenced hearings in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.806" offset="3056904">The first of those hearings took place in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.028" offset="3073727">At that time the situation was as we described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.518" offset="3095670">The last attempted reapportionment had been in 1953, the last actual one in 1930 and the situation existed in the state of distortion such that the smallest county Huerfano, perhaps appropriately named since it means the orphan, but in this case a well treated orphan, Huerfano with population of 7000 persons had one representative in the House of Representatives and Jefferson County with a 127,000 persons had one representative also.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.720" offset="3252509">There existed in the Senate a similar kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.116" offset="3274138">The least populous county was represented, had a Senator representing 18000 persons, a few over 18000 and the most populous county for unit of Senator, one representing a 127,000, again in each case better than nine to one discrimination and singularly unfortunate.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.572" offset="3375911">In that case, the Attorney General appeared to represent the assembly of Colorado and then principle offices of state who were the defendants in an injunctive action, the parties have since been changed slightly by the rules on the substitution because other officers have succeeded but that was taken care of simply by administrative order of Court and is not a problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.504" offset="3487611">The persons were also allowed to intervene who were at the time sponsoring one of two proposed Constitutional amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.289" offset="3534840">One of those proposed Constitutional amendments is known as amendment number seven and is constantly referred to in the briefs here under that name because we have no other method in Colorado of naming them, they are just the numberings or ballot positions in a particular election, but it's the only reference that exists whereby it can be referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.012" offset="3625642">There was another measure, amendment number eight proposing a somewhat different mode of reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.077" offset="3661900">It should be mentioned here that in the Colorado scheme of things on Constitution they referred matters or other referred matters one measure does not run against another measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.199" offset="3718429">Everyone votes on each measure and each measure must be enacted and become a possible Constitution if it receives the majority of the votes cast upon that measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.679" offset="3768375">So that if there would be two confliction measures, there is question of considerable intricacy as to what would happen but fortunately that did not happen. It only became a conjecture of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.926" offset="3825322">At any rate the interventions were allowed on behalf of Mr. Johnson and others who were sponsors of the measure amendment number seven and they participated throughout the trials in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.196" offset="3890419">At the end of the initial hearings the statutory court took the matter under advisement and it rendered a per curiam opinion which we have referred to as the memorandum opinion which is reprinted I believe at the end of the jurisdictional statement in its entirety and which appears in 208 Federal supplement, they referred to in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.845" offset="3993028">In that opinion the Court held that the Colorado apportionment was completely unconstitutional as it existed that there was no rational basis for it and that the testimony which included the testimony of all of the proponents of amendment number seven did not constitute a basis upon which the existing apportionment could be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.052" offset="4105877">The Court rendered its opinion, however, as I recall it made later part of August of the year and it pointed out with several problems existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.771" offset="4144747">First there was an impending election; second there was extremely little time before that election, and third, it did not then know what the result of the election might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.007" offset="4197619">So though it declared the scheme as it existed to be unconstitutional it stated that it would abide the result of the election then hold further conferences and hold further hearings dependent on what might have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.516" offset="4259686">What did occur was that the measure denominated number seven was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.117" offset="4286122">Now, that is set out also fully textually in the introductory portion of the brief particularly on page seven and following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.069" offset="4333874">It amends in their entirety Sections 45, 46, and 47 of the Article 5 of the Constitution, the sections I had referred to before is having existed from 1876 onward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.992" offset="4401583">It amends them in several particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.157" offset="4414226">The House of Representatives, as it had existed last before amendment consisted of 65 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.321" offset="4458948">The Senate consisted of 35 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.479" offset="4475562">It was provided that these members were to be elected from districts which might be altered from time to time as public convenience might require, but that they must be composed of four counties adjacent physically and that no county might be divided in the creation of senatorial districts or house, there could be a house district, no they couldn't pardon they couldn't be divided at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.821" offset="4612966">Now this resulted in somewhat an inconvenience which has nothing much to do with the matter before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.839" offset="4645044">In the election from a district such as the city and county of Denver in which there are 17 representatives and the 17 representatives must be elected at large because under the old Constitution that could not be representative districts within the county, so persons have to bear in mind in vote among 34 candidates and this is something of a feat of memory if nothing else, this was altered by the new amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.075" offset="4757893">The new amendment added, essentially did this; it left the house at 65 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.278" offset="4786732">It provided that the 65 members the House of Representatives must be apportioned as nearly on the basis of population as maybe that is from district is nearly equal in population as maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.652" offset="4848277">There is no objection obviously Constitutionally capable of being raised to such a situation possibly there was none under the old formulae expect the failure to apportion it, it was not he Constitution that was defective but the practice of not putting it into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.466" offset="4915464">Under the old system we used a weighted ratio basis in which we gave 19,000 persons for the first senator and a representative and 8,000 persons for the first senator and then it took a fraction up to 48,000 to get another representative and a monumental fraction to get another senator and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.294" offset="5006788">The whole idea being that as the represented area grew larger the possibility which having representation grew smaller, that being the entire purpose well carried out for many years of the system and it resulted in a rural based legislature entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.062" offset="5077841">The new system requires that the house be on a basis of single member districts as nearly equal in population as maybe and it prescribes a method of contiguity of districting, and it is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.611" offset="5140117">The Senate is quite another problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.496" offset="5155581">The Senate provides that there be an increase in the number of senators from 35 to 39 for additional ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.629" offset="5200198">One of these additional senators is given to the county of Boulder, one is given to the county of Adams, one to Jefferson and one to Arapahoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.072" offset="5237919">The counties of Boulder, Adams, Jefferson and Arapahoe are in the near vicinity of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.882" offset="5265191">Adams, Jefferson, and Arapahoe county form a doughnut as I believe the Solicitor produced a map, shortly before the hearing and I take it, it has been distributed to the Court, it's a very good map and it is perhaps futile to observe some of these things, one tends to assume a greater knowledge of Colorado geography and non-Coloradoans for various reasons and it perhaps is easier to visualize from the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.735" offset="5372607">But at any rate Adams, Jefferson and Arapahoe are in a doughnut immediately around Denver and Boulder is a county slightly to the north of these, but for all practical purposes because of the highway linkage and the State University situation and the population growth trend it's in the immediate Denver metropolitan area and is so considered in census track designations at the present time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.148" offset="5550239">Then the balance of them become very large territorial areas which are agrarian in the case of Adams and Arapahoe and which are mountainous in the case of Jefferson, because Jefferson begins to move over into the mountain ranges themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.643" offset="5620247">The population is explosive in those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.045" offset="5637802">It should be borne in mind because it's the basic statistical problem here, that Colorado in the decennium 1950 to 1960 increased 33 and a fraction percent in total population, but while it increased 33 and a fraction percent in population, it's rural areas decreased actually by 6% in gross population, it's urban areas increased by 55%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.642" offset="5764234">Now not only did it's urban areas increased by 55%, but the increase was not in the city and county of Denver, the great urban area which increased only 18%, but was primarily in Adams, Jefferson and Arapahoe counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.574" offset="5823898">Adams has the curious distinction of being next to Tokyo the most rapidly growing area in the world. It increased 199% in the decennium in population and Arapahoe 120 -- no 117% and Jefferson 127%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.464" offset="5899549">So these are very rapidly growing areas indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.563" offset="5911878">They have now approximated 350,000 to 360,000 persons in the three counties which is very nearly the population of big city in county of Denver itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.238" offset="5954615">Boulder is growing quite rapidly as well, but not nearly at the same rate the others are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.457" offset="5979483">There are two other urban areas in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.834" offset="5992963">One of them is the area surrounding the city of Colorado Springs in El Paso County to the south, and the other south of that the City of Pueblo which is growing less rapidly but is a major urban area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.873" offset="6049178">As will be noted this pattern of population follows in a line from Boulder on the north to Pueblo on the south and it follows almost directly along the corridor of the mountains along the east footings of the mountains in a very long narrow strip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.342" offset="6134964">Now what has happened in the decennium is typical of what has happened in the century within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.411" offset="6175297">The population of the state initially was primarily centered at the confluence of the passing Cherry Creek which is Denver and was one of the gold sites and it developed into a large city rather initially, but then the prime populations were centered in the mountain gold caps, places like George Town, which I suppose nobody has ever heard who doesn't come from Colorado, once had 18,000 people and it's now got population of 600 in an assortment of rather nice summer houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.826" offset="6320956">Central City of which every has heard because of an opera had the opera because it had something like 15,000 exceedingly affluent minors and it now has a population that's 300.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.481" offset="6371529">The county of Las Animas once had a flourishing population because coal was mined there in great quantity and I suppose the coal still obtains in great quantity, but the population doesn't, because nobody mines it anymore and the population has gone away and continues to go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.745" offset="6460659">The situation is very much like that which typifies the United States generally from the period after World War I to the present time, in that population has tended to migrate into a series of metropolitan centers maybe 30 in number and the statisticians state that 70% or 90% of all American population will be in those 30 centers by 1980, a good part of it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.950" offset="6585420">The result is that almost two-thirds of the populations of the state live in the three urban areas and one-third lives in all of the rest of the enormous expanse of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.205" offset="6642471">Now getting back to the Senate and trying to relate this matter in some logical sense to it, the Senate as I say was by the amendment frozen in exactly the manner in which the Senate had been districted under the statutes declared invalid by the Court, prior to the amendment except that four senators were added, one being given to Boulder county, one to Adams, one to Jefferson, and one to Arapahoe and except that a tiny county called Elbert which consists of a number of cattle ranches and no habited places at all really, except one with 250 people in it, was the next to a different district for purposes of balance, the Elbert change does not statistically make any difference and it doesn't in any governmental sense, it was a convenience for which some reason might be perhaps announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.713" offset="6908502">The result -- oh yes then the amendment further provides that these districts and it incorporates the unconstitutional statute, I use the word unconstitutional because the Court said it was unconstitutional, it incorporates it by reference, by specific terms in haec verba and then it says that this statue may not be changed by any general assembly at any time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.962" offset="7033472">It provides that so far as the Senate districts adopted from the old statute are concerned these are fixed, but so far as multi members Senate districts, the multi member Senate districts which will now be Denver, Adams, Jefferson, Arapahoe, Boulder, El Paso, and Pueblo counties, these districts must be redistricted each ten years on the basis of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.714" offset="7152486">It is difficult to understand why the bifurcation in the Senate areas, but it does provide so. If it's a multimember district it must be redistricted, but otherwise it may not be changed and so if population continues to go away, it goes but the senator remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.980" offset="7225524">If population is crescent it increases but the Senate remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.206" offset="7246422">Now this was not a matter idly entered into, it was entered into on the basis of a measure presented under the referendum provisions of the Colorado Constitution and very carefully calculated and very elaborately sold to the electorate and successfully sold to the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.869" offset="7349136">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.332" offset="7354987">The electorate voted for the measure more often than it does for the opposing measure or didn't vote at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.981" offset="7381527">It's hard, as I say to analyze these things absolutely because of the fact that you may not vote on measure or vote on one you may vote on both of them, do as you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.558" offset="7423846">They're all independently submitted, but if these did get substantial popular back, it did so for a variety of reasons I would suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.113" offset="7466060">I don't know that's it fruitful to try to go into them as a matter of political exegesis among other things the notion of not having single member districts has always distressed people because it's very hard to sort out 34 candidates in an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.777" offset="7528754">This has nothing to do with the Constitution problem we have before us, but it was no doubt an appealing factor to the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.162" offset="7558324">Many other factors might have entered into the problem but the problem is we have the Senate as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.708" offset="7584447">Now the question is whether or not the Colorado Senate as it exists intentionally and permanently divorced from population as a criteria having a history in which population has been really the only basic criteria is rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.325" offset="7662918">And if rational and not invidiously discriminatory whether it is within the tale of the Fourteenth Amendment or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.987" offset="7705550">We have submitted that it is not because of several very clear facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.312" offset="7726866">First all that it did was embody, as a Constitutional provision, a statute which was a declared by the courts to be invidious and which has no change except the (Inaudible) on it of four additional members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.418" offset="7791336">Now even the four additional members don't make any particular sense if I may refer to the Solicitor general's map without the impropriety of invasion of authorship several things do appear rather clearly on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.505" offset="7863643">Boulder County which is marked on the map as having 74,254 persons, it gets two senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.565" offset="7915888">This reduces the portion to 37,000 to 127.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.879" offset="7941175">Districts 11 and 12, El Paso County, 71,871; it's stays at two senators that is though it has twice as much claim initially to another senator as Boulder had, it doesn't get anything but it stays in the same position it was with no relief of any kind granted to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.536" offset="8035738">Pueblo remains in a similarly awkward position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.786" offset="8048799">It had two senators this raised it to 59,000 per senator but it gets no relief and Boulder is given an extra senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.368" offset="8087147">Adams, Jefferson and Arapahoe really aren't helped terribly much because as we have indicated in Appendix C to the briefs filed they come closer to requiring three senators apiece than two, they're given two but they -- even given the two they come out with 60,000, 56,000 and 63,000 persons per senator represented as compared with something like Las Animas which has 19,983 persons represented by a senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.587" offset="8212012">The same distortion was just popped out but the distortion now is said to become a constitutional rather than the statutory provision, and somehow this mal-assortment of four members is supposed to have satisfied matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.208" offset="8278468">Now there are curious justifications given for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.931" offset="8293410">The record, seeking to justify it, has attained a Greek chorus that runs through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.534" offset="8323816">The Greek chorus is composed of the words topography, geography and history rather (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.697" offset="8364463">It doesn't vary at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.202" offset="8378465">Only that when you examine the geography, the topography and the history as enunciated by the witnesses, it is very hard to ascertain what precisely they meant or how you equate these things with the actuality of the distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.308" offset="8462892">The history merely states that there used to be people in the mountain mining counties and when there were people they were represented and that now historically the areas should be represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.778" offset="8532796">I don't mean to be flippant in any sense, but this is kind of history that is precisely parallel to the Russian borough system which was advocated as history in England in the 1830s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.062" offset="8585877">It was advocated that Old Sarum should continue to have three members of parliament because it had once been a seaport in the Cathedral City though it had been reduced to three persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.445" offset="8631434">And in the same way you can argue that Gilpin County should continue to be represented because it once had some quite colorful people and a great deal of silver and gold and still possesses an Opera House but it has 600 residents and 300 of them live in one city and it has nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.836" offset="8724953">Once population has gone away there is, we submit, nothing left to represent; a representative system, it does not represent mountains or plains, it doesn't represent water, it doesn't represent cattle, it doesn't represent sheep as opposed to them and that is in the record too that it should, it represents only whoever lives in the area and if no one does, then we submit that the area cannot be represented any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.616" offset="8856087">We have some startlingly testimony in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.680" offset="8872388">A portion of it, the testimony of Dean Rogers which is contained in an exhibit appended to the appellee's brief, it is a large part of the record, the Court dispensed with the printing of the record but the appellees did print the substantial portion as their exhibit and this appears at Page 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.038" offset="8969772">Dean Rogers was a principal, historical expert for the state and one of the questions asked to him was, at the bottom of 80, “Yes now as I understand it, one of your statements in examination by counsel was it is a belief with persons advocating population on the Pennsylvania basis as I understand it, that heavily populated areas are dangerous if given equal representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.281" offset="9070814">May I ask to whom they're dangerous?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.394" offset="9083248">“Dangerous to the welfare of the state,” and editor Root who is the most famous and best knows spokesman of this point of view, setting conferences for the New York Constitution in the 1890s, I think 1894 that the heavily populated area should not be represented as generously as the rural areas because the cities from their very effective population could organize in a way in which they had much greater strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.595" offset="9180006">They were subject to political machines, subject to the activities of Chambers of Commerce and various other organizations, elements which were not applicable to rural areas and he therefore carried successfully an amendment to the proposed Constitution of New York which limited representation of the big cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.373" offset="9247088">“Dean Rogers do I understand if -- that there is not in your opinion a possibility of successful rural political organization in a state such as Colorado?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.811" offset="9284914">“Well, I hardly know how to answer the most striking organization of Colorado which is apparent the political organization which is influenced the state that surrounded Denver and the like.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.695" offset="9324411">And then finally just the – a categorical statement that urban populations are dangerous, evil in the much greater sense of the word I take it, and they should not be represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.264" offset="9370700">Well then of course the polity is in an extraordinary state of danger because 90% of the population is urban and this is not we submit a rational thesis and being an irrational thesis, we suggest that it is perhaps not within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.678" offset="9452306">Now we get into another problem it is alleged that Colorado and the reply briefs make much of this to the Solicitor General's brief that Colorado is a state with great geographical differential and in which communications are exceedingly difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.547" offset="9535794">I do not mean to be pejorative, but this is in a sense nonsensical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.221" offset="9570484">In December of this year, if I may use a personal illustration I was required to try a case in Grand Junction which is directly over the mountains from Denver in a straight line during the worst period of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.149" offset="9634223">I left after my breakfast by aero plane, I arrived in Grand Junction in time for court, I tried the case in Grand Junction returned by plane and had my dinner in Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.761" offset="9684692">Now this traverses the whole of the dangerous Western slope area, the week following I was required to be in Washington, in the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.936" offset="9733384">It took me, it being admittedly an unusual week, a larger amount of time to traverse the area from Friendship Airport into Washington than it had taken to traverse the area across the (Inaudible) of the Rockies from Denver to Grand Junction, and it was somewhat a more tiring trip.[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.931" offset="9829410">The point is that I'm afraid the isolation of the state falls now into the area of mythology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.796" offset="9868803">We read in the newspapers that Aspen, a city who's character would hardly be determinable from the briefs in which it is described as having television only from Kansas I believe and able to receive radio only from Glenwood Springs and perhaps mail only by carrier pigeon or husky in the bad part of the year, but this is not very recognizable when we read in our papers that these three members of the cabinet spend weekends skiing there and seem to be able to attend their duties the following Monday morning with no difficulty at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.490" offset="10011640">They usually arrive by air and they land, skiing is a major occupation in the state and out of Denver every weekend into the far fastness of each of the so called remote senatorial districts at least 80,000 people make their way usually on Friday evening and get back usually on Sunday night with almost nothing of incident to report except whatever might transpire on the slopes and I suppose it's not of representative interest in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.773" offset="10140685">The state's geographical bifurcations are not as great as stated and they have no basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.598" offset="10176003">Now the other matters and as the Solicitor has mentioned this with much more potency I think than we did in our briefs, the other matters that are mentioned as justifying the differentia which are imposed upon the state representation, are economic matters into their interest is the way the lower court expressed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.751" offset="10284672">It is hypothesized that there are many economic facets to the life of Colorado, this is quite true, it is a curious state in that Denver which overwhelmingly contains its population is a city obviously not supportable by the state itself, but acting as a major commercial distribution center and a major economic function for a great group of western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.049" offset="10401805">The state itself contains a belt of cattle farming, a belt of sheep raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.057" offset="10429913">It has the great plains area which are an ideal wheat region.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.546" offset="10447781">It has an irrigated crops region, which is of great significance and it is still mineralogically quite important part of the mining scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.442" offset="10495428">It does have problems resulting from its geography and agriculture connected with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.251" offset="10522595">This is much mentioned in the briefs and somewhat in the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.524" offset="10539732">We do unusual things with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.016" offset="10549658">We make it move itself across the mountain range and then we generate some electricity with it and then we move it back under the mountain range, but -- and the result from time to time as the Court no doubt knows, disputes concerning its utilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.476" offset="10623532">But this is also we submit not a basis for representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.816" offset="10652894">Only one Constitution of which I have any recollection in recent years has tried to give a legislative representation to specific economic interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.221" offset="10706497">The Weimar Republic attempted it from 1922 to about 1926 in its upper chamber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.442" offset="10735441">It never succeed in computing the formula on which the several interests might be represented and the upper chamber of all the unfortunate things in that unfortunate experiment proved the most disastrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.414" offset="10799284">We cannot have a senator for beef or a senator for sheep or a senator for water or a senator for wheat, barley or sugar beets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.558" offset="10839826">That is impossible and frankly it is somewhat (Inaudible) to assume that there is such a thing as a senator from Denver, bad though they are painted who does not have in mind sugar beets, water, wheat, barley, cattle and sheep also, we exist on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.689" offset="10932404">The entire state does and there is no great urban blackness that is trying to trample them out, that would be foolishness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.844" offset="10985067">All that one can do in a situation of this sort it must be submitted is to submit that Constitution of it, there is some kind of an ethos which underlies representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.747" offset="11052672">That ethos must be that the representative represents something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.967" offset="11077541">If he represents something then it can only be people, because otherwise there is no criterion for representation other than one so loose as to lead to a latitudinarianism of representation that must prove ultimately fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.113" offset="11162073">If you say that you are giving an area a representative because there are cattle in the area, then as the Solicitor points out this is invidious in itself, the cattle do not have a right to be represented, nor do the people who's wealth is invested in them have any more right of representation than those who are invested in sheep or those who are invested in an oil refinery in an urban area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.135" offset="11266145">There is no more predicate for the one than for the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.853" offset="11289028">We therefore have in the state presented perhaps the most straightforward situation of representational difficulty within the state legislative field presented in any of the cases to date before the Court, because we have simply the question “May the electorate itself at whatever instance and for whatever reason change the course of its legislative history and create a Senate admittedly not representative of population and intentionally freezing a scheme which ran counter to a required population representation, appeasing that scheme by the grant of for senators to desperate districts peculiarly and inadequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.717" offset="11536460">It is said that in some manner the sanction of the people grants a peculiar sanction to this matter and that if nothing else, the Court should disregard from point of equity, the problem which is raised in this matter and apply us (Inaudible) doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.534" offset="13659797">In the view of the government, this is a case in which the issues are very closely balanced and difficult in the sense of being sure about what is the just result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.011" offset="13717684">On balance, the United States joins the appellants in urging reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.413" offset="13743284">Although the grounds we take seem to me to be considerably narrower than the appellants and upon one issue, our agreement with them is at least qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.627" offset="13788110">As we see it, there are two questions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.223" offset="13806501">On the merits the question is whether the Colorado apportionment filed in the Senate by taking the legislature as a whole violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.249" offset="13862612">We think there is also a question whether the bill should be dismissed for want of equity without deciding the merits, a question which was not in any of the previous cases that were argued during this term, with respect to state legislative apportionment and which is here because of the circumstances under which the present apportionment became law in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.759" offset="13968669">It was adopted not only by a majority vote of people of Colorado in 1962 after virtually a decade of discussion, referenda consideration by the legislature and other official bodies, but it was adopted by a majority vote in each and every county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.472" offset="14067516">In addition, the initiative and referendum are available and by custom apparently more available than in some places to change it and we think that this does bear on the question of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.283" offset="14146824">Departing from what would be the customary practice, I would like the Court's indulgence to discuss the merits first and to discuss the question of equitable digression second.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.992" offset="14201576">I do think also it's unusual that it'll make argument a little bit clearer if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.573" offset="14227908">On the merits as we see it, the issue can be narrowed very rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.663" offset="14252254">We adhere here to the principles advocated in the previous cases in our briefs in the previous cases, including our arguendo assumption that the equal protection clause does not always require per capita equality, but that there maybe some factors that will justify departure from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.730" offset="14332607">The starting point therefore in our analysis in this case as in the others, is that is per capita representation measured by that test that the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.092" offset="14401988">Second we note that this is not a case in which the pattern can be said to be an obvious crazy quotes such as was involved in Baker and Carr or the Maryland, Delaware and Alabama cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.594" offset="14456009">We think it does have a conceivable reason behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.071" offset="14481923">Nor can it be said we think that the criteria upon which this apportionment is based are contrary to any express Constitutional limitations or are invidious in the sense that race or religion or some consideration of that kind is invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.047" offset="14553812">Some of the considerations advanced by the witnesses and taken into account we think by the District Court and apparently referred to in the briefs strike us as irrelevant and impermissible in the sense that we've used that term, but there are other permissible factors also cited which we think at least furnish an intelligible basis that are not irrelevant as we have used the term and this therefore takes the case out of our third rule as we have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.240" offset="14682647">Thus in our view the case comes down to the question, a question of degree whether the variations in per capita representation are so severe, so great, as in relation to the permissible justifications alleged, as that they can be called arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.839" offset="14792989">Now I think it is fairly possible to narrow the argument down just a little bit further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.717" offset="14824545">The Colorado Constitution under this amendment calls for apportionment of the house in preparation to population and the legislature passed the bill which works out so that it takes and to get a numerical majority of the house, it takes districts containing 45% of the population, which I think we would all have to agree is pretty good, that they have -- it's conceded conform to the constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.303" offset="14958814">I have heard it suggested that whenever one house of the legislature is apportioned in proportion to the population that a state may do as it wishes with the other house. No such claim is made by the appellees as I understand their argument, although I suppose they would be glad to win on that ground, but they don't urge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.888" offset="15065185">And it seems to me that they are quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.963" offset="15081485">The so called federal analogy as we have suggested before, is inappropriate for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.164" offset="15118265">In the first place history is entirely different and I needn't elaborate that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.375" offset="15147105">In the second place of course under the Colorado apportionment there is no representation of the counties as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.210" offset="15182527">There are some counties that have more than one senator, there are some senatorial districts which are made up of more than one county, and I might suggest also in view of a question for Mr. Justice Goldberg earlier, that I think there is as a practical matter another marked difference between the situation of state and the situation of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.518" offset="15283673">The states by and large are large enough so that they contain urban and rural interest, take Colorado as an example, Denver and the rest of the state and this is pretty generally true as you go over the country, so that the Senate is perhaps indeed are strongly representative of the urban interest, whereas you come to break down to the size of senatorial districts in a state like Colorado.</text>
