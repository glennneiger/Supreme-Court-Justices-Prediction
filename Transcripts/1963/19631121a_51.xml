            <label>Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion</label>
            <text syncTime="9.413" offset="141040">Honorable Chief Justice and Justices of the Court, I'm here representing the Louisiana Secretary of State who is charged under this particular act with preparing the ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.234" offset="200286">And as a chief election officer of the State of Louisiana, all of the ballots are prepared by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.871" offset="234872">Then they go to the printer.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.858" offset="246784">And then they are placed on the voting machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.301" offset="260577">Now, we have voting machines in every precinct in the State of Louisiana and we have had for about -- had for about 10 years now.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.591" offset="309687">They proved very effective and very beneficial on the ballot which is prepared by the Secretary of State, are three things, the man -- the candidate's name, his race and at first, when it -- legislature first prepared ballots who instructed the Secretary of State to prepare these ballots, we found that we had a lot of illiterate people in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.436" offset="429119">There are a lot of people who were registered to vote who couldn't read and write.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.174" offset="444061">And so later on, they put the number on the voting machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.018" offset="459421">So, we have three things that appear on the ballot, a number, a name and a race and that is all that is on the voting machine other than the instruction that you got to push this button and switch this switch and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.178" offset="512084">Now, we have in a Democratic primary -- well, a Republican primary, too, but there's very few Republicans in Louisiana, I apologize for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.897" offset="546983">But we're having a primary election on December the 7th in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.006" offset="571434">And of course, I am a candidate for a reelection.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.085" offset="579688">And I reemphasize that in my case, number 20 is my ballot number, my race and my name and that's all that appears on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.439" offset="613125">Now, that information, and may it please the Court, is given to the Secretary of State in a form of a qualification paper that the candidate himself must fill out.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.878" offset="658892">On that qualification paper, approximately six things, he signs an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.285" offset="680521">He says that I'm a qualified voter, that I possess all the qualifications under Louisiana law, that I'm a registered voter in a certain ward, in a certain precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.357" offset="716779">He says, "I herewith pay the fee which is required by the committee involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.538" offset="733497">He also says that I am not a dummy candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.380" offset="744887">He also says that I am not a subversive person as defined under the appropriate section of Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.449" offset="773204">And he also says that I am a member of blank and that candidate fills in his race and it is from that qualification paper that the committee passes on the -- and accepts and they're given to the Secretary of State and from there, he prepares the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.159" offset="839973">I give you that information so you can understand the -- the Louisiana legal machinery on just how the ballot is prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.448" offset="889187">The question in this case, as far as I'm concerned and I hope the Court, is really a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.015" offset="923460">It comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.480" offset="933282">Can a State require information on a ballot, such as race, for the purpose of informing the electorate?</text>
            <text syncTime="218.185" offset="976123">Can it do that when it treats all of the candidates alike?</text>
            <text syncTime="223.769" offset="998484">Now, is that unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="225.776" offset="1006425">Does it violate any section of the United States Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="229.330" offset="1020740">I don't think that the First Amendment is involved here because there's no freedom of speech being denied to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.112" offset="1043832">I don't think the Fifteenth Amendment is involved here because no one is being denied the right to vote on account of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.914" offset="1075075">The only thing that we are concerned with and can be concerned with as a result of this complaint is whether or not it violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.115" offset="1127842">The State is, of course, charged with the qualification of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.816" offset="1158666">It can pass laws regulating voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.684" offset="1170160">It can pass laws regulating qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.906" offset="1183013">It's within its own spill when it does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.093" offset="1195760">And it commits no offense to anyone or to the Federal Constitution as long as those laws treat all alike and there is no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.710" offset="1242258">Now, there's no discrimination in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.554" offset="1253543">We're not involved with a segregation case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.846" offset="1266709">We're not involved with any reprisals in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.355" offset="1280815">We're not involved with the interest of an individual ballot as against the -- the interest of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.044" offset="1311535">There is nothing that prevents or says in the law that a candidate has got to have -- has got to have complete anonymity when he places his name on the ballot box.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.144" offset="1359914">The State does not go into the election box and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.773" offset="1378513">It's done entirely secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.469" offset="1389275">And the right to vote is a cherished privilege and should be enjoyed by everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.558" offset="1409651">But we must remember and we must appreciate that when a person goes into the ballot box and votes, he has the privilege of discriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.234" offset="1452283">He can vote against the candidate because of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.116" offset="1467852">He can vote against him because he doesn't like a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.750" offset="1478405">He can vote against him because he don't like the way he talks or walks or he can vote against him because he's -- it is the incumbent, there's a lot of people that work with everybody on the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.110" offset="1519783">I hope that's not true on December the 7th of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.023" offset="1531486">But when a man goes into -- a lady goes into the voting booth, if there's none running for office, he necessarily must vote for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.504" offset="1565341">When he does that, he actually discriminates against the other eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.384" offset="1580910">So that is a privilege of voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.969" offset="1587284">That is one of the cherished principles of voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.774" offset="1598464">So I reemphasize --</text>

            <text syncTime="398.818" offset="1698670">Now, we had a -- a Governor in 1940 by the name of Sam Jones who ran for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.669" offset="1718000">Now, can you imagine how many Sam Jones is of the different races there are in the State of Louisiana?</text>
            <text syncTime="408.827" offset="1738689">Suppose that Ike Smith wanted to run for office, how many would we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="412.576" offset="1753631">That's the only question involved purely having an informed electorate and that is absolutely all.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.954" offset="1779231">We have some 61 Negroes running for office in Louisiana in the primary coming up on December the 7th.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.328" offset="1812668">We even had, in one parish and it may be interesting to note, we had one justice apiece and a constable who were Negroes, who qualified and it didn't even have any opposition and they're going back into office without any opposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.987" offset="1915277">Now, of course, the Government in its amicus curiae brief points out that if a State want to aid the voters that it could publish a biographical sketch which, of course, would show you a religious affiliation, your clubs that you belong to, where you live and what your college education or your high school education would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.547" offset="1997511">With all due respect to the Government's position, I -- I think that if they say that's alright, then their brief is completely in our favor and should be treated that way because I personally think, in all sincerity, that if the State did that, as the Government want -- would have us do, then we would definitely be aiding candidates and we will be practicing discrimination and we would be fostering prejudices.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.448" offset="2097194">I -- I have no doubt about that and I think that that would definitely be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.243" offset="2116315">But I come back to the fact that this case should not be embellished with platonic ideas, this is strictly a legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.551" offset="2157589">And this, of course, is a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.758" offset="2166366">And the question here and sole question here is can a State pass such a regulation without doing offense to the Federal Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="525.864" offset="2206804">Many states, as also cited in the Government's brief, require you to say where your residence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.999" offset="2235329">And in Massachusetts, they want you to know whether you're an incumbent or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.037" offset="2251525">Well, if -- if that's --and those -- those who've never charged, I see no difference between stating what your race is and stating that you live at such and such an address.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.926" offset="2307114">Because it's -- many of the voters, for instance, in Louisiana if you'd have one of the candidates here before they finish, rather Mr. Belton, whom I know real well, I know where he lives, he lives in Scotlandville which is a very heavily populated Negro community near Southern University and if he would put his residence down there, everyone would know his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.914" offset="2399065">I'm saying if we didn't have race against and it had residence the way the other States did.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.885" offset="2834892">And that -- I don't see where that's doing any -- any offense fostering prejudices of any nature or kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.693" offset="2922141">They are -- they are listed as Mrs. so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.368" offset="2932799">But we don't require sex because people generally know that if your name is Lillian, you're certainly going to be a female.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.321" offset="3024645">Now, when this law was passed in 1960, saying that the race had to be spelled out by the candidate and put on the ballot, there was considerable discussion as to whether or not a photograph should be put on the ballot, as Justice Harlan asked yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.621" offset="3093817">Now, suppose -- it was determined, however, that a photograph would be too cumbersome.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.478" offset="3121298">And I suppose that the candidates for office or the members of the legislature probably had themselves in mind and they said, "No, we're not going to fool with photographs if we just put race on the ballot and that would sufficient identity."</text>
            <text syncTime="767.441" offset="3173125">Now, the -- the whole question here, as I repeat, is not a question of morals, it's not a question of policy, it's not a question of whether this is a wrong risk legislation or right legislation, it's a question of whether or not, as long as all candidates are treated alike, a State may require a designation of race on the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.398" offset="3460995">But I come back to the same question that it -- it's immaterial.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.062" offset="3607594">And I think that this Court not to come up and say that it's wrong to identify a candidate on a ballot would have the reverse effect of putting a stigma on a particular race, which I don't think it would be proper to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.030" offset="3671542">Now, of course, opposing counsel said that we had all kind of laws passed to this particular session but that's not the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.190" offset="3712084">We're only involved here with one particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.163" offset="3732041">And the question, as I repeat, is whether or not a State can legally provide this information to the voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.657" offset="3778017">Now, it maybe that you might be constrained to say that the State would be discriminating because of the fact that we have a large, large number of Negroes in our State, but that isn't the controlling point, gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.992" offset="3831306">And Justice, I believe Justice Stewart asked yesterday, "Would this law be legal in South Dakota where there are very, very few?"</text>
            <text syncTime="939.243" offset="3860355">I certainly think it would be legal in South Dakota.</text>
