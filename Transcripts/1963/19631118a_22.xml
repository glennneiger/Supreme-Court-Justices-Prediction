            <label>Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant II</label>
            <text syncTime="30.514" offset="226492">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.107" offset="232866">This case, unlike the cases previously before the Court during the preceding week, presents not questions involving legislative apportionments of the States but questions involving profound issues affecting the structure of our National Government for it involves the structure of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.515" offset="306427">It was the House of Representatives which was to be in the words of George Mason, the grand depository of democratic principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.450" offset="338192">Indeed, here lies the principle upon which all Republican Government is founded for by assuring equality of political participation to its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.623" offset="382913">The Government secured not only the strength of popular support but it assured to each of its citizens the attentive consideration of his rights by those in power to the end the Government would be responsive to the will of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.702" offset="439233">Yet, this basic principle upon which an important branch of our Federal -- Federal Government is founded has been undermined by the repeated failure of the States to properly apportion their congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.755" offset="491374">This case presents in bold relief the very clear question of whether a State may deprive its citizens of more than half their representation in the House of Representatives by their failure to properly apportion congressional districts long after massive shifts and population have deprived these districts of their representativeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.225" offset="589281">This case, Your Honors, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by two residents of Fulton County, Georgia for practical purposes, Atlanta, who are qualified to vote for representatives in Congress from the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.056" offset="656572">In 1932, Georgia, following the census of 1930, lost two of its delegates in the House of Representatives having its apportionment reduced from 12 to 10 Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.177" offset="705055">This necessitate of course a reapportionment of the Georgia Congressional Districts which was done under the Act of 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.680" offset="739119">This Act which is quoted at length in the appendix to our brief in which the statistics of which are set forth fully in the brief apportioned Georgia's 10 congressional districts throughout the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.710" offset="791259">The largest, Fulton County, was roughly about 80% larger than the smallest district created under the Act of 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.042" offset="824592">It is noteworthy that the District Court seemed to find in this apportionment a not -- unreasonable deviation from popu -- population.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.757" offset="855416">However, in the 30 intervening years since the apportionment of 1931, the Act has lost all contact with reality because of massive population shifts which have occurred in Georgia principally in her Fifth Congressional District, Metropolitan Atlanta which is seen an -- toward growth during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.475" offset="938277">In 1960, based on the population figures of the 1960 census, the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia was more than three times the size of the smallest congressional district in Georgia, the Ninth District with the exception of only one possible combination of congressional districts, Georgia's Fifth District, is larger than two -- any other two congressional districts in the entire State.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.107" offset="1036810">The 556,000 people residing in the Eighth and Ninth Congressional Districts of Georgia possessed two Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.884" offset="1067948">Yet in more than 823,000 people residing in Metropolitan Atlanta, the Fifth Congressional District, had only one Representative in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.519" offset="1110476">This, we submit, is the crux of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.322" offset="1121656">It sets forth a clear violation not only of equal protection which is applicable to state legislative apportionment but it violates even more fundamentally the standards set forth in Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and as applied to the States through the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.579" offset="1206711">It is interesting to note that at the time of the decision in the District Court, the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia was the second most underrepresented congressional district in the whole United States out of 435 districts both from the point of view of population and from the point of view of percentage of deviation from statewide average districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.037" offset="1292497">It was exceeded only by the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, the Dallas District which is since been held unconstitutional, the Texas Districting System by the United States District Court in Texas in Bush v. Martin on October 19, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.392" offset="1353937">This Court, parenthetically, it may be noted, has granted a stay in that proceeding.It is also important to note that the District Court in ruling upon the claims presented by the appellants under the Privileges and Immunities Clause and under the Equal Protection Clause clearly decided the merits of this claim contrary to the suggestion made by the Solicitor General in this case, for the District Court said that it found the facts not in dispute and that the facts were adequate to reach the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.849" offset="1499805">The District Court itself felt that it was reaching the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.394" offset="1514015">After reviewing ex -- extensively the facts set forth in the case, the District Court concluded that it did not find the proscribed invidiousness either from the point of view of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment all from the point of view of the rights asserted under Article I, Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.835" offset="1587785">As an alternative ground to that decision, the majority of the District Court concurred in only by two justices -- judges went on and said that it felt that the relief should be denied for what it called "want of equity".</text>
            <text syncTime="386.342" offset="1649748">It is clear that in attaching the want of equity labeled to the case presented by the appellants that it was merely restating the political question doctrine of justiciability set forth by Justice Frankfurter in Colegrove v. Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.500" offset="1706381">It merely changed the label because it said and quoted at length that portion of Colegrove in which Justice Frankfurter had said, "This matter is exclusively committed to another branch of the Government, Congress under Article I, Section 2 and Article I, Section 4 and Article I, Section 5."</text>
            <text syncTime="418.155" offset="1777016">The Court relied on this and relied on what it considered the preservative treatment given this rationale in Colegrove by this Court in Gomillion v. Lightfoot and Baker and Carr is the basis for its alternative holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.592" offset="1830724">But nevertheless, before reaching this point, the Court decided the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.950" offset="1852144">Additionally, it might be pointed out that even if the Government were correct in its assumption that the court really didn't quite decide the merits, they are here with no reasons to send the case back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.061" offset="1900628">The facts, as the lower court observed, are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.421" offset="1914107">There are no factual conflicts to be drawn by this Court or to be left to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.477" offset="1938348">There are here no real local factors to be considered as to which the expertise of the local court on the scene might be advantageous as might exist in the state legislative apportionment cases because here, we're dealing with a federal standard, the right to equal representation in the House of Representatives, the National Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.003" offset="2032389">It is clear from a consideration of the constitutional history from our country, we submit, that the right to equal popular representation in the National Legislature in the House of Representatives is well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.835" offset="2087769">It begins with the Declaration of Independence, the declaration that all men are created equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.597" offset="2110757">It is particularly interesting to note that in the Declaration of Independence itself, one of the prime grievances of which the colonies then complain, was the fact that George III would not provide legislation for large bodies of people unless they would give up the right to representation in the legislature, a right in es -- in (Inaudible) to them and formidable to parents only.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.510" offset="2206469">It is clear that the Framers of the Constitution themselves felt that this was a fundamental right of our republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.574" offset="2238652">The record of the Federal Convention shows it's very clear that while primary attention was directed toward the problem of whether or not in the entire legislature, the entire National Legislature there would be equal popular representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.675" offset="2303122">The language is strongly appropriate to the House of Representatives for there the large States prevailed and it is their language which is deemed controlling as to the intent of the Framers of the Constitution in apportioning the National Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.420" offset="2370100">The language which stay on top is appropriate for this purpose for it confers representation upon the people, not the city people, not the country people, not those in power, not those not in power but the people of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.743" offset="2435406">It is important also to point out at this point that the right which the appellants assert, the right to equal representation in the House of Representatives, the Federal Congress, is one derived solely from Article I, Section 2 which confers representation on the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.056" offset="2504579">It is not depended upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.469" offset="2510221">It is not derived from the guarantee clause of Article I, Article IV, Section 4 which relates to the right of state governments to be republican in form.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.261" offset="2553480">It is an Article I, Section 2 right.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.739" offset="2563302">It is reinforced, of course, by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which continues, as we consider it, the right of equality of political representation and the right to equality of political participation of the people but Equal Protection Clause merely reinforced this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.775" offset="2631534">It did not create it.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.004" offset="2636445">It was antecedent to it in Article I, Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.961" offset="2652223">This, I think, is a major distinguishing factor between the case which is presented by the appellants and that which is presented by the state legislative apportionment cases for it is the Constitution which establishes a right to equal popular representation in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.976" offset="2728291">It is clear also from the finding of the District Court that the District Court considered under the established standards of constitutional adjudication the apportionment of Georgia Congressional Districts to violate what we would've called the "traditional equal protection test".</text>
            <text syncTime="672.639" offset="2794956">The District Court did not so conclude it but for reasons not based on findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.541" offset="2814600">As a fact, the District Court found that it was clear by any standard that the population of the Fifth District was "grossly out of balance" with that of the Georgia Congressional Districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.348" offset="2861829">The court later said in its opinion that the plaintiffs, not unlike many other citizens in our republic are being deprived of equal treatment arising from the excess in population of their congressional district as compared with the other congressional districts in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.871" offset="2927867">And finally and probably, the most pervasive statement of the unconstitutionality and the unconscionability of the Georgia Congressional Districts is the concluding statement that the Georgia Congressional Districts now reflect a system which has become arbitrary through inaction when considered in the light of the present population of the Fifth District and is measured by any conceivable reasonable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.386" offset="3029953">No clear violation of equal protection of the laws as defined in the decisions of this Court could be set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.856" offset="3055867">As a matter of factual finding in the District Court for reasons that are not apparent, the majority of the District Court concluded that the system was not invidious, whatever invidious meant to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.510" offset="3102469">It is clear however, that invidious is defined by the decisions of this Court particularly the decision by this Court in Morey v. Doud in which this Court summarizes the standards applicable to invidious discrimination that is clear that if the system is arbitrary, if it is without a reasonable conceivable basis, then it does violate the Equal Protection Clause and that the decision of the District Court is just clearly wrong on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.193" offset="6673199">It's clear that unless you're prepared to retreat to the proposition that this Court could not have enforced the constitutional standards in the race cases, it could not hold that -- the power of Congress under Article I, Section 4 with this area is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.226" offset="6741326">Furthermore, it's pointed out by Judge Tuttle in the District Court, it would seem that in allowing the States to exercise the power to the district and to prescribe qualifications, Congress does so on the assumption that the States will comply with the constitutional standards of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.468" offset="6810290">It does not intend that the State can depart from those principles nor could Congress intend if it so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.593" offset="6838815">We take the position and we do not need to for purposes of this case but I think its fair to do so to apprise the Court fully of our position on this point that Congress could not if it so desire to legislate the congressional districts which now exist in Georgia because Congress as well as the state governments is subject to the fundamental requirements of equal popular representation under Article I, Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.232" offset="6937349">Furthermore, this Court, again in dealing with the power of Congress under Article I, Section 4 has a long series of decisions, repeatedly rejected the claim that this power was exclusive of that of the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.294" offset="6997535">They only have mentioned a few cases, Smiley and Holm, Wood and Broom and Colegrove and Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.530" offset="7022508">In each of these cases, the assertion was made that the power was exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.977" offset="7044347">It would in Broom, the District Judge Holmes, dissenting at great length, emphasized repeatedly the exclusivity of what he thought to be the power of Congress under Article I, Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.048" offset="7092621">In Colegrove and Green, Mr. Justice Frankfurter devoted many eloquent lines of his opinion to this proposition, yet, in each instance, this argument was rejected by a majority of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.918" offset="7140059">In Wood and Broom, notwithstanding the assertion by Judge Holmes below, not a single member of this Court accepted that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.267" offset="7177467">The majority went off completely on the statutory construction question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.342" offset="7197738">The concurring justices placed their decision for want of equity, a ground plainly unturnable if this Court were without jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.070" offset="7240683">Turning to the question of remedy briefly, it is our position that the Court should hold the Georgia apportionment of congressional districts unconstitutional and enjoin its enforcement, enjoin the two defendants from carrying out its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.360" offset="7301810">This relief would not been in conflict with the policy of Congress favoring, in some instances, the election of Congressmen by districts for Congress itself in other instances has sanctioned exceptions to this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.820" offset="7367638">For instance, in this last congressional election, Alabama elected all eight of her congressional representatives on an at large basis because of the failure of the States to reapportion her congressional districts following a loss of representation out of the 1960 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.289" offset="7437542">Thus, this situation is not materially different from that which exist in that situation because it is merely a situation, both are situations of where the old Apportionment Act has become invalid and inadequate to comply with the applicable standards required of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.813" offset="7511625">Further, it -- it seems to me, a specious argument to suggest that in requiring an at large election that this Court is -- itself moving in conflict with the discretionary power of Congress to require elections by a district.</text>

            <text syncTime="2668.469" offset="10778290">It would be properly decided in the first instance by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.602" offset="10806815">The Government submits that this case is controlled by Baker and Carr in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.674" offset="10835132">We believe that Baker and Carr is controlling as to the power of the federal courts for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.745" offset="10859374">First, because in Baker and Carr, this Court explicitly stated that this Court does have power to adjudicate the constitutionality of congress -- congressional districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.223" offset="10905245">And even without this expressed statement, we believe that it logically follows that if the federal courts can adjudicate the constitutionality of state legislative apportionment, they can likewise adjudicate the constitutionality of congressional districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.483" offset="10978283">And finally, we believe that Baker and Carr is controlling not only on the power of the federal courts but also whether the federal court should exercise their power and refuse to dismiss for want of equity in the ordinary circumstances such as the circumstances which are now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.528" offset="11058531">As to the power of the federal courts, to hear cases involving congressional districting, this involves three separate issues as this Court recognized to Baker and Carr, subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts, the standing of the plaintiffs to bring the action and whether the particular question is justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.585" offset="11134704">I will pass over standing and subject matter jurisdiction since we think that these questions are clear beyond doubt and I will leave our discussion to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.916" offset="11176082">We likewise believe that there is little question that the federal courts have the power to adjudicate congressional districting in the sense of justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.990" offset="11220386">In Baker and Carr, this Court citing its earlier decisions in Smiley and Holm, Koenig and Flynn and Carroll and Becker stated and I'm quoting, "That these cases settle the issue in favor of justiciability of questions of congressional redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.935" offset="11288095">The Court followed these precedents in Colegrove."</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.537" offset="11302515">End of quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.013" offset="11308471">All four of these cases which the Court cited actually involved congressional districting within particular States.And in</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.099" offset="11340758">Addition, this Court assumed justiciability in Wood and Broom by going on to decide the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.106" offset="11368866">Therefore, there are six cases decided by this Court culminating in Baker and Carr in which this Court has held or assumed that the questions of congressional districting may be decided by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.283" offset="11425499">Quite apart from the explicit statement in Baker and Carr and the earlier decisions of this Court in congressional redistricting cases -- in congressional districting cases, we believe justiciability of congressional districting follows from the holding in Baker and Carr that state legislative apportionment is justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.036" offset="11500523">These two problems are in many respects the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.473" offset="11514316">The first step in apportioning a state legislature is to decide on the appropriate districts and then to allocate the Representatives among those districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.093" offset="11556739">Insofar as the two problems, congressional districting and state legislative apportionment are different we believe that the justiciability of congressional districting is more clear for two of the most serious problems in this area concerning justiciability, are whether appropriate subsidy of criteria can be ascertained and whether proper judicial remedies may be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.612" offset="11662796">And we believe that both of these problems are easy of solution as to congressional districting than is to state legislative apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.133" offset="11700935">As to the substance of criteria, the Solicitor General in the state apportionment cases in arguing last week and today advanced various criteria to be applied to state legislative apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.189" offset="11757150">And we believe that all these criteria would be equally applicable to congressional districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.038" offset="11780556">For example, if the State districted its Congressman without any with -- so as to discriminate against some people and in favor of others without any rhyme or reason in a crazy quilt pattern, we think that this would violate the Fourteenth Amendment and it would appear that this standard would invalidate Georgia's congressional districting.</text>

            <text syncTime="4959.214" offset="19941209">We consider this question about whether or not the Court should retain jurisdiction by leaving the complaint on file or else from the other hand to dismiss the complaint, possibly with the idea of a suit being brought after reasonable lapse of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="5007.914" offset="20136082">The second part of our brief goes upon the thesis that the case is moot as the last general election and that is -- and the case is premature as the next general election.</text>

            <text syncTime="5484.181" offset="22041140">The case starts off with a review of the historical -- with the history of Congressional District in Georgia and it goes on to say the facts are not in dispute and now ample for final decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.271" offset="22109477">And I think that they are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.953" offset="22116164">That was the opinion of the District Court and apparently both of the parties in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.861" offset="22135808">The Court goes on to say that the position, it goes on to comment upon the posture of redistricting nationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.606" offset="22170812">Said it is the position of the plaintiff that the population of each district should be within the range of 10% to 15% of the average district population based on division on the number of districts into the total population of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.074" offset="22216683">The Court goes on to say there are 435 congressional districts in the United States.22 Congressmen will be elected state at large in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.939" offset="22252105">Of the remaining 413, the Fifth District of Texas has the largest population of 951,527.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.091" offset="22284810">There are 22 districts with populations exceeding 600,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.849" offset="22299752">Eight districts having population of more than 15% above the state average while the nine, they have populations of more than 15% below the state district average.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.525" offset="22330472">Using 10% of the variants for tolerance, 108 districts are above and 125 are below the average, a total of 233 or more than one-half of the -- of all the congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.308" offset="22373627">So that (Inaudible) which had borne out by the record, it indicates that the congressional districts of the nation by and large are malapportioned if he use population as the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.365" offset="22413855">And of course, this is just purely as directed to the figures of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.589" offset="22430783">It does not include the problem, related problem of gerrymander and of course that this Court would get involved in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.302" offset="22457637">I would assume the gerrymander in equities, so to speak, arise from the gerrymander would be just offensive as a -- as the variation of population stand if this Court would get involved in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.877" offset="22503926">But we can see briefly and from the record and from the opinion, that this whole country is maldistricted congressionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.786" offset="22531511">And there we say, it's another reason why this apportionment is reapportioned from the congressional districts in the first instance, should be left to the state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.006" offset="22568396">Because if this Court were to in it's -- in it's remand to say Georgia's Congressional Districts are malapportioned, maybe, you come up -- maybe with come forth with some criterion about all the districts have to be substantially equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.342" offset="22625761">If this Court was to come forth with that criterion in this case, then of course, that would inject the District Court all across the nation into the area, into the field of congressional districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.678" offset="22675080">And we've seen a recent case of that in Baker versus Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.910" offset="22688037">In fact, I would imagine in Baker versus Carr that this Court has -- has a great deal of pride in the alacrity that the District Courts have acted in because across the nation in Baker versus Carr did not give I think quite properly so, the District Court no criteria to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.453" offset="22762224">But yet the District Courts have -- have approached this job with an eagerness and I would imagine this Court is well satisfied with it but you're going to see the same thing with congressional districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.675" offset="22803080">And -- but yet, you've already put in to play -- you've advised which is going to soon correct any dissatisfaction with congressional districting to reapportion state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.130" offset="22860967">And so I think that in viewing this situation, it's important for this Court to look at the national situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5694.988" offset="22884373">And we're not just concerned here with Georgia because the whole nation is watching the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.958" offset="22912272">The District Court went on to say in commenting among present system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.567" offset="22926691">It says it now reflects the system which has become arbitrary through inaction when consider in the light of the present population to Fifth District and as measured by any conceivable reasonable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.982" offset="22972353">Now, I don't know what much -- what more anyone could want whether it's the Solicitor General or the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.213" offset="22993251">That's a very strong statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.660" offset="23019060">The Court goes on to say, our view is practiced by due regard for the admonition in Baker versus Carr that a judicially manageable standard must be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.342" offset="23057721">This dictates that a reasonable time be afforded for the State for the normal state government processes where there is a substantial chance of relief as we believe there is to run their course.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.223" offset="23101294">The Court goes on to review Colegrove.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.684" offset="23111116">And of course, as this Court pointed out, I think properly so, the Colegrove decision, itself, four of the Justices there, recognized that the Court had jurisdiction in justiciabilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.840" offset="23167749">But -- and for those as Justice Rutledge though felt there was not sufficient equity in the petition and because he joined with Justice Frankfurter and read in Burton, the petition was dismissed but at the same time, I think that is as significance in Colegrove.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.126" offset="23220935">The District Court attach to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.387" offset="23225950">That was -- that has clearly been pointed out in Baker versus Carr as of the treatment to be received, to be accorded to Colegrove versus Green in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.213" offset="23261268">Now, the Court goes on to say, and this they're -- next to the final paragraph, it said, "We do not deem it to be present for dismissal based on the non-justiciability of a political question involving the Congress here but we do deem to be strong authority for dismissal, for want of equity when the following factors are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.977" offset="23340262">Here involved are considered on balance, a political question involving the coordinate branch of the Federal Government, a political question posing a delicate problem difficult of solution without depriving the others of the right to vote by district unless we are to redistrict for the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.374" offset="23397940">Relief maybe forthcoming from a properly apportioned state legislature and relief maybe afforded by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.134" offset="23424899">Now, I think that is quite clear that the Court, the District Court, all the three judges of the District Court, recognized that there was justiciability, that this did not fall entirely within the political question doctrine which is fully insulated from judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.480" offset="23482368">There were some elements of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.973" offset="23488324">I think its reference to the congressional remedy and that involving a coequal branch of Government, exerted some reluctance upon the District Court to act but it by no means equated that with a perpetual refusal -- refusal not to ever act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.596" offset="23558750">And now, to save the point, Justice Tuttle, filed a concurring and dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.764" offset="23591455">And there seems to be -- as I analyze the opinion, very little difference between their views.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.966" offset="23608278">The question that seems to divide them was whether or not petition should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.145" offset="23624997">Now, this Court has frequently applying the doctrine of equitable abstention, has frequently permitted the petition to be dismissed with the understanding, sometimes implied that if things were not corrected or if the State did not afford a remedy, the suit could be reinstituted after the expiration of a reasonable time.</text>

            <text syncTime="6797.565" offset="27294678">And this we feel that the Court did this -- the statute is not -- thus far been brought to the Court's attention in argument or in the brief, except in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6806.899" offset="27331981">But we view of the statute right here is an effect or ratification by Congress of the state congressional districts because it begun, it says -- see and this is the decennial reapportionment statute of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6820.944" offset="27388197">Until a State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof as to any apportionment, the Representatives to which such State is entitled under such apportionment shall be elected in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6833.865" offset="27439815">One, if there is no change in the number of Representatives which has none has not been for 30 years in Georgia, they shall be elected from the districts then prescribed by the law of such State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6845.468" offset="27486312">And if any of them were elected from the State at large, they shall continue to be so elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.967" offset="27504285">Then the statute goes on with several other alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.981" offset="27516301">But we feel that it's clear that this right here is a congressional ratification which we feel is another element that should be considered in the scale to whether or not this Court should equitably abstain at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.206" offset="27597176">Now, Wood versus Broom, which involved the 1911 Federal Congressional Reapportionment Act, this Court held that the requirements of equality among of -- of population among the congressional districts, no longer apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="6890.034" offset="27664572">Justices Brandeis, Stone, Roberts, Cardozo's concurring result but felt that the complaint should be dismissed from want of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6898.454" offset="27698218">And it's obvious that the Wood case has coincided with congressional intent because there has been no effort in the part of Congress to alter the courts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6906.904" offset="27731968">And Colegrove versus Green, this Court was confronted with a much more -- with a much greater ratio than is in the Georgia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.199" offset="27761225">In Georgia, the ratio between the least populated district and the most populated one of 3-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.402" offset="27782019">In Colegrove, the ratio was 9-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="6926.006" offset="27808455">And I think there's one passage in here that while we can fence about the -- the legalisms involved, in -- in concerning required congressional redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="6937.789" offset="27855579">I think that Justice Frankfurter addressed himself to practical consideration involved in Colgrove when he makes the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6945.738" offset="27887344">To sustain this action would cut very deep into the very being of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.973" offset="27908242">Courts ought not to enter this political thicket.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.602" offset="27918796">Remedy for unfairness in districting is to secure state legislature that will apportion properly or to invoke the ample power of Congress and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.938" offset="27956099">But I think that while we may talk about status of the Indian tribe and so forth and of foreign affairs and the Court -- the Court is quite correct in applying the political question to those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6975.682" offset="28007090">But I don't know of any issue that would have so much effect on the Congress then for a nationwide requirement invoked immediately that all congressional districts must sustain substantial equal population.</text>
            <text syncTime="6988.524" offset="28058499">Because obviously, that's going to result in substantially a strike from the changes in the constituencies of the various Congressmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6994.764" offset="28083472">And obviously is going to produce to varying extents new faces in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6998.659" offset="28099041">We call this, as Justice Frankfurter said, strike to the very being of Congress itself, the membership itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="7007.920" offset="28136030">Now, one thing about the dissent of Justice Black which was incurred in by Justices Douglas and Murphy and we may be wrong, of course there are those here on the bench of course who know much more about that than I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.490" offset="28190365">But it will look like to me that one of the significant attributes of that, the same one -- of the significant elements of that dissent was -- was a realization that if this Court did not grant relief that they could get relief from no other source.</text>
            <text syncTime="7035.219" offset="28245222">The dissent says, the dissent was clearly predicated, but this is my claim, the dissent was clearly predicated upon the assumption, there was no likelihood in Illinois would afford relief to the appellants because the state legislature was apportioned in such a manner that the state legislator had an interest in perpetuating the complained of congressional districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="7053.606" offset="28318783">And furthermore, because a series of suits previously instituted in the state courts challenging the valid -- the validity of such districting had proved ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="7062.363" offset="28353891">And to me, that is insignificant element of the dissent, was because that there was no available relief that the appellants could gain from any other source.</text>
            <text syncTime="7071.917" offset="28392030">I see my time is up, I'll --</text>
