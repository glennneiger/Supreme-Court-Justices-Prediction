            <label>Mr. Wills C. Darby</label>
            <text syncTime="15.993" offset="167372">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.317" offset="180642">In all cases that we have found, where the question of immunity of a state from suit has been raised in the federal courts involving a private citizen, either of that particular state or of a sister state, all of these cases arise under the constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.645" offset="253994">It would actually be impossible to have the case -- it did not so arise where a citizen was involved due to the fact that there would be no diversity of citizenship between a state and any of the citizen as they state itself has been held by this Court not be a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.922" offset="315016">Therefore, all cases which we have cited and all the cases decided by this Court are in point insofar as the question arises out of the constitution, the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.372" offset="364857">The -- we -- we do not think and we submit that there is nothing as well known in the law, in this country insofar as the proposition which we argued before the Court today and that is that a state can not be sued in a federal or any other court without it's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.565" offset="441657">Some examples of the cases of this Court that show the extent of that well bounded rule, we submit are some of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.790" offset="478542">In Beers versus Arkansas, the state had enacted a law that allowed it to be sued in its own court.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.486" offset="505292">A suit was filed in the court, thereafter -- and after the suit was filed, the state changed this law and the court -- a court there held, the state court held that the immunity was thereby -- well, the waived ones was taken back and this Court affirms saying that the court that rather that the state had a right to change it's own law with respect to immunity even after a suit was filed as they had an unconditional right to withhold the waiver of their immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.777" offset="618454">In the case of Ford Motor Company versus Department of Trade Real Estate of Illinois, the plea of immunity was raised for the first time in this Court that had not been raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.604" offset="661817">The Court found that by entering into the suit and trying it on its merits below, the state did not wave its immunity due to the fact that the Attorney General of the state did not have the power to waive the immunity of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.297" offset="716570">In the case of Missouri versus Fitts which we submit is just as strong as the case here or at least for the appellant was a case where the state court supposedly was interfering with the jurisdiction of a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.664" offset="790026">And the lower federal court issued an injunction against the state from proceeding in its own courts in connection within a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.834" offset="822732">There again, this Court held that the judicial power of the United States did not extend to a suit by a citizen against the state and therefore it could not be used even to protect the judicial power of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.200" offset="880201">We submit that the same is true insofar as Congress is concern here.Congress does not have the power we submit to enlarge the judicial power of the United States either directly or indirectly and thereby require a state to be sued or as a condition of doing anything in the state would otherwise have the right or privilege not to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.120" offset="967868">And we submit that that is true even assuming that Congress could prohibit a state from engaging in interstate commerce by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.025" offset="1003499">We -- we particularly urged upon the court that this Court should not determine on the record here and on the act of Congress, that Congress intended in any matter whatsoever to condition states engaging in the operation of a common carrier by rail upon it's submission to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.331" offset="1080717">That would open a door that would in fact destroy a state's immunity from suit because if Congress has a power to condition the states engaging in the operation of a common carrier by rail on the states subjecting itself to suit, certainly it would have the same power in connection with the -- with a highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.043" offset="1155532">It would have the same power with the connection of the state using an instrumentality of commerce.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wills C. Darby</label>
            <text syncTime="273.659" offset="1198059">I do not think that Congress could constitutionally express such a condition insofar as a state is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.077" offset="1223659">And the reason for that is that a state's immunity from suit is something founded in the constitution and whether it's considered a privilege or a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.787" offset="1262529">And this Court has described it as a right that Congress cannot take away a right as a condition of doing something if they -- a body would otherwise have the right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.299" offset="1300564">That leaves us to the series of cases by this Court where a state though it has the power to exclude a foreign corporation entirely from doing business within the state, the state does not have the power to require the corporation to waive a constitutional right or privilege that it might otherwise have as a condition of doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.825" offset="1374647">And this Court, in the Hanover case where it declared the first Employer's Liability Act unconstitutional based its decision in part specifically on that ground because the court found that at that time, the Act covered the employees while they were not engaged an interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.920" offset="1451029">And the court said that Congress did not have the constitutional power to extend under the Commerce Clause and take away or extend itself outside of the Commerce Clause and take something away that the parties otherwise had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.969" offset="1503274">Here, we have a constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.087" offset="1515708">Or for at least, its so interpreted and the Eleventh Amendment that adds weight to it and shows that the -- the people as well as the courts and Congress have particular said that Congress has no such power under any circumstance and the words as used by this Court, they say the whole sum of the judicial power of the cost of the state for the Federal Government does not extent to a suit by a citizen against his owns state or by a sister state.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.390" offset="1624900">So Congress can't add to the constitution even if it desired to do so by way of --</text>

            <text syncTime="413.414" offset="1757080">You have Ex parte New York that was an admiralty case involving the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.108" offset="1783829">And there again, the court held that even though at the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, one specifically included in the constitution that it was not going to hold that the state could be sued under the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.872" offset="1838895">And we submit that in substance, this Court has already held that it is all inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.980" offset="1859271">The court has not held on the question of a condition other than in the Hanover case and it was not classified as a condition there.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.913" offset="4051048">With reference to the matter that Mr. Justice White was discussing with Mr. Darby about this remedy under the State Board of Adjustment, that -- that Act says that the rules of Chapter 5 of Title 26 of the Court of Alabama as to liability are to be filed in claims for personal injury or death of the employees of the State of Alabama or of any of its agencies, commissions, boards, institutions or departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.375" offset="4240906">And then Section 26 says that -- shall not -- that's the Workmen's Compensation Act, shall not be construed or held to apply to any common carrier doing an interstate business while engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.100" offset="4303809">So they say that they are providing a remedy for the petitioners under the State Board of Adjustment Act which puts liability on the basis of liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act and the Workmen's Compensation Act specifically excludes coverage to employees of common carriers engaged in state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.801" offset="4410598">So we're at their mercy, we have no means of review in any court as he admits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.382" offset="6296952">But if it is Constitutional Immunity, Mr. Justice Douglas, in Petty, he said this, that when -- when the Court in 1793 held that a state could be sued in the federal court by citizen of another state citing Chisholm versus Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.294" offset="6428505">Now, we say this, that if -- if there is any immunity by virtue of the Eleventh Amendment, it could either be surrendered or waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.062" offset="6487646">It's not dealing with a matter of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.718" offset="6494229">It's dealing with a manner of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.648" offset="6501961">Now, as I say, we -- we contend that the State of Alabama did voluntarily surrender that sovereign immunity that it had from suit in accepting the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.014" offset="6571447">But if it didn't surrender it at the time the State of Alabama accepted the Commerce Clause, then it surrendered it or it waived it later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.670" offset="6622020">When a few years ago the State of Alabama adopted an amendment to its own Constitution which authorized the State of Alabama to engage in this type of business and under that Constitutional Amendment, it delegated to the legislature of the State of Alabama the power and the authority to enact appropriate laws for the state to engage in this business and this -- and -- and the people of Alabama by Constitutional Amendment authorized this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.648" offset="6794010">And then -- but they turned it over to the legislature by the amend -- on -- by the Constitutional Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.358" offset="6812818">They gave all these power to the legislature then the legislature proceeds to enact statutes that says that the state will operate these -- these facilities through a States Docks Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.816" offset="6882617">And if they do, it should be their duty to negotiate these working agreements on the Railway Labor Act, and that the legislative act says, "And operate this railroad as though it were an ordinary common carriage."</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.533" offset="6957537">Now, we submit that that action of the people of the State of Alabama who delegated it by Constitutional Amendment to the legislature and constituted it either a surrender of sovereignty and supported this manner of -- of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.054" offset="7035591">Or if they didn't surrender it, they certainly waived it and then we add on couple of the Constitutional Amendment and the Legislative enact the conduct of the State of Alabama under the Constitutional Amendment and the legislative enactment and what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.234" offset="7108315">They -- here are the things they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.718" offset="8026258">And you're saying by that action, it -- which in whole that it waived this right, sovereign immunity or to be sued in the courts because it went into that business knowing and under the supreme law of the United States, it did said that there must be liability.</text>
