            <text syncTime="33.988" offset="239365">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.714" offset="254203">This case like the two which have just been argued also arises under Section 8(b)(4)(B) of the Taft-Hartley Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.115" offset="287848">The questions presented in this case, however, are quite different from those that are involved in the cases which you have just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.086" offset="319718">We're not concerned here with consumer picketing nor with appeals to high level supervisory employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.710" offset="350229">Nor are we particularly concerned with the 1959 Amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.433" offset="377083">The conduct that's involved in this case is the more traditional union conduct of appealing to employees to withhold services, there's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.951" offset="423163">And the question is whether the particular appeal in this case is prohibited by 8(b)(4)(B) or is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.702" offset="466213">Specifically, the question presented in this case is this, may a union which is on strike at an industrial plant, picket one of the entrances to the that plant which is used by a railroad to provide pickup and delivery services at that plant for the purpose of the preventing the railroad from performing those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.976" offset="599228">I will say that there is one fact in this case which it had in common with all the others although it's often said that Section 8(b)(4) was intended to protect neutral employers, not the employer which whom the union is engaged in a lawful dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.056" offset="659623">But I think it's significant though, obviously not controlling that in each of the three cases that -- before the Court today, the employer who's complaining that's he's being -- that the complaining of a violation is the primary employer and yet in each case, the primary employer saying, "We are complaining because you were hurrying, that isn't neutral."</text>
            <text syncTime="162.961" offset="755231">The strike in this case was against Carrier Corporation which is one of the respondents here.At the large plant that company has in Syracuse, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.252" offset="800371">In connection with that strike, the union picketed all the various inferences engaged to the plant but the dispute concerns only to picketing which took place at one particular gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.656" offset="857945">A photograph of that gate appears on page 305 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.330" offset="872678">Its general counsel's exhibit number two and I believe it's easier to visualize the -- what exactly is involved in that case if we look at that photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.874" offset="930879">The chain-linked fence which you see in that picture is the fence which surrounds the main Carrier property.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.872" offset="962853">At one time, Carrier owned all of the real estate which is with -- within that fence.You can see the Carrier plant off the left just behind that clump of trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.221" offset="1012276">Some years before this particular case arose, Carrier conveyed to the New York Central Railroad, a 35-foot strip along the southern part of that property, just inside this fence on which these railroad tracks run, you'll see the railroad tracks there on the photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.792" offset="1086568">Now, those particular tracks are used for two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.825" offset="1106631">As you see, just inside the gate they divide into two-fourths.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.370" offset="1132857">The right hand railroad track is used to provide pickup and delivery service not to Carrier but to other -- two or three other industrial plants which are in the immediate vicinity adjoining Carrier.</text>

          <turn speaker="jerry_d_anker" startTime="325.814" stopTime="499.327">
            <label>Mr. Jerry D. Anker</label>
            <text syncTime="325.814" offset="1406621">I'll concede for the purpose of this case that the keys are in control of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.931" offset="1435146">The left hand track, as I said, serves Carrier and further down again out of view in this picture, there are little spurs off of that left hand track which run right into Carrier plant onto Carrier property, into Carrier warehouses where cars are loaded and unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.292" offset="1512573">Now, for the first nine -- ten days of this particular strike, although there was picketing at this gate throughout I believe, the railroad made no effort to provide service to Carrier but used this gate in this right hand track to provide services to its other customers and the union pickets interfered in no way with those operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.798" offset="1598568">Those operations went on without any difficulty of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.023" offset="1619466">On the tenth day of the strike which was March 11, 1960, by prearrangement between Carrier and New York Central, the railroad attempted to provide service to Carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.528" offset="1665442">Specifically, it wanted to move 14 railroad cars -- empty railroad cars into a Carrier Warehouse and pickup from that same spot an equal number or approximately equal number of cars which had been loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.358" offset="1724792">On that day, it first provided service to its other customers and so long as it was doing that, the union pickets did not interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.687" offset="1754154">Then, it withdrew from the gate that the certain distance where it had left the 14 railroad cars which were destined for Carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.439" offset="1789158">It picked up those cars and by the way, also at that point, picked up another crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.357" offset="1812773">The regular railroad employees were unwilling to provide service to a struck plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.697" offset="1838164">They were therefore relieved by the New York Central of their assignment for that period and the train was then manned by lower level of supervisory people, and with that new crew proceeded back toward this gate with the purpose of bringing those cars into the struck plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.435" offset="1909112">It was at that point that the conduct took place which is an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.025" offset="1927502">The pickets both by peaceful persuasion, and also, there's no dispute about this by trying to obstruct -- physically obstruct the passage of this train by standing on the tracks, try to prevent this particular service being performed for the company with whom they were on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.911" offset="2003048">Now, in the process of moving those cars in and taking the loaded cars out, it caused this fork that's right here and near of the gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.094" offset="2035754">The railroad had to pass several times back and forth to accomplish those switching operations at that fork and each time that the train came out of the gate or tried to go back in, it was met with the similar kind of conduct by the union pickets.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.763" offset="2190399">I don't think there were any feisty cops but there was this kind of obstruction -- attempt to obstruct the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.541" offset="2213491">On those facts, the NLRB found that while the physically coercive and the violent conduct which took place not here but at other places in connection with the strike, the union did violate Section 8(b)(1) which makes it an unfair labor practice to coerce or restrain employees in the exercise of their statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.781" offset="2302516">That finding is not involved to these dates, there was a -- it was not challenged by the union in the Court of Appeals and it's no longer an issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.011" offset="2635421">And this Court said that so long as those employees were performing work which is related to the operations of the struck plant, any such inducement is not a secondary boycott activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.167" offset="2696025">The Court of Appeals reversed that decision and that's what brings us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.799" offset="2714520">The major premise of the decision of the Court of Appeals was that Section 8(b)(4)(B) prohibits any efforts by union to seek the support of any employee who was not an employee of the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.568" offset="2789648">If the -- the union may not have make any kind of request for support to employees who work for other employers unless that appeal is simply an incident to a lawful attempt to appeal for the support of the primary employees which obviously in this case, it was not -- there were no primary employees immediately at the vicinity of this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.568" offset="2877628">We don't contend that there was any object here to appeal the primary employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.285" offset="3176469">The basic question which is involved in this case is where the line is to be drawn between what the statute now expressly refers to as primary strike and primary picketing and what the Act, though it doesn't use the words "intends to prohibit" as a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.872" offset="3270823">Question is not very different from the question that arose in GE or the many, many other cases before the 1959 Amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.080" offset="3355669">Before General Electric, before 1961, there was a considerable amount of confusion on where that line was to be drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.487" offset="3461308">General Electric involved a -- a confrontation of two conflicting lines of -- of development which we've traced in our brief and I don't want to go into the history but I will just state what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.948" offset="3519195">One principle which you see running through many, many cases since 1947, was that so long as the union, when it is appealing to secondary employees, is asking no more than that they stop working at the side of a primary dispute at the plant or shop or store where the strike was in progress then even though possibly the literal language of the statute might reach even that kind of conduct that is the normal type of thing which occurs in a primary strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.847" offset="3666735">That was one line of development.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.857" offset="3674781">The second line which began we think we can trace it to about 1953, was quite different and in direct conflict with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.358" offset="3712815">So the conflict was never really acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.553" offset="3721592">That second line was, that any appeal and it's essentially what the court below in this case relied on, any appeal to employees or secondary employers is unlawful unless it is merely an incidental or accidental or unavoidable part of what is otherwise justifiable as an appeal to primary employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.428" offset="3817096">Those two lines sort of existed parallel and the -- the conflict was there though it was never really acknowledged.GE presented the inevitable direct confrontation of those two lines because the picketing was at a gate to the primary premises, there was no question about that, but the gate was used only by secondary employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.456" offset="3925243">So if it was unlawful to appeal the secondary employees except part of law -- except where it's part of a lawful appeal to primary employees, then the picketing in GE would be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.428" offset="3969128">And indeed that's what the Board held in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.196" offset="3984175">If on the other hand if the earlier cases are correct that it's permissible to ask secondary employees not to work at a -- at a site of the strike then the GE case is easily answered in exactly the opposite way because this was the site of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.862" offset="4070797">This Court, I think accepted neither one of those two theories in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.631" offset="4097860">It developed instead a third which is in the Court's words that the key to the problem is the kind of work which is performed by these secondary employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.519" offset="4149478">Then the Court went on to say, borrowing some language from Judge Lumbard in the Second Circuit in an earlier case, that if the work is -- that these secondary employees are to perform, is work which is related to the normal operations of the struck employer then it has a permissible part of a primary strike for union to ask those employees not to perform that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.655" offset="4249997">If it is unrelated, on the other hand, then even though the work might be at the struck site itself, the union cannot go out of its way but picketing a separate gate used by employees who perform work unrelated to normal operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.917" offset="4379042">Well, let me tell you what I think is meant by work which is related in normal operations and the Court didn't have to define it in GE because it was remanded to the Board for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.522" offset="4433481">It doesn't have to define it here really because there's no dispute that at least that delivery and pickup work is so related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.989" offset="4463365">But, the definition that I think is what the Court had in mind is that work which without which it would be more difficult for the employer to conduct his operations or impossible for him to conduct his operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.712" offset="4518222">Now, that's not true for example of construction worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.545" offset="4533582">If the employer was in the -- was building a -- a new addition to his plant, the non-performance of that particular work would not prevent him from carrying on his own ordinary operations that's unrelated to ordinary operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.180" offset="4612054">Now, the railroad in this case certainly the -- the performance of deliveries to these neighboring employers is work unrelated to the operations of Carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.964" offset="5155192">But that the -- that argument is no longer really a part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.193" offset="5176195">Now, there are three distinctions which are suggested by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.333" offset="5196675">The three bases for distinguishing the General Electric case and -- and holding that the rule in the General Electric case is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.255" offset="5232410">I want to deal with those only in the very briefest way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.005" offset="5247352">One, is the distinction relied upon by the court below, that because this little 35-foot strip was owned in fee simple by the railroad, that somehow makes the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.626" offset="5305866">In our view, it -- it can't make a difference really on any theory either on the General Electric theory or indeed on any of the other two theories which preceded the General Electric resolution because what the statute deals with is not where you picket as such, but what you're trying to accomplish by picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.736" offset="5398340">Now, sometimes, where you picket, tends to show just as the case we were just talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.533" offset="5421537">If the union picketed the New York Central Depot, somewhere 20 miles away, obviously the purpose of that would be to cause or disruption of operations there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.264" offset="5464377">And in that sense, the location of the picketing, of course is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.470" offset="5485275">But it's relevant not in itself but only to the extent that it reveals what the purpose of the picketing is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.693" offset="5518190">Secondly, there is an argument made in this case that when Congress amended the Act to include railroad employees, it intended to reach this kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.221" offset="5564270">There's just no evidence to that, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.541" offset="5573569">All the Congress intended to do as the Solicitor General explained in the earlier argument, was to close a loophole which exempted any kind of disruption of railroad operations entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.760" offset="11870438">Prior to that time, the Labor Board had repeatedly held that spur line picketing of precisely the type that is involved here, and I'm referring to the International Rice Milling case decided in 1949, and referring also to the Great Northern case decided in 1960 but which had it inception before the amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.372" offset="11960822">In these cases with identical spur line picketing involved, the Labor Board had held that because of the employer definition then existing in the Act, the railroad employees were not subject to the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.151" offset="12031979">The Congress dealt with this problem and dealt with it on a basis of rather startling unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.611" offset="12065834">Senator Morse, Senator Dirksen, the then Senator Kennedy, Congressman Griffin, all addressed themselves to this question of the closing of loopholes because of findings of the Board that railroad employees were not employees within the meaning of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.653" offset="12165935">They were not prisons within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.177" offset="12176071">And the unanimous statements documented at that time were to the effect that it was the intent of the Congress to close this loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.180" offset="12216090">I think it is put in most graphic terms by Senator Goldwater who also joined in the colloquy and I am referring to page 13 of the amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.678" offset="12262066">And if I may, I should like to read one paragraph which I think puts the congressional intent in sharp focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.309" offset="12296652">This is quoting Senator Goldwater, "Suppose you get a situation like this, the union has a dispute with employer A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.026" offset="12327476">A, in order to finish his economic processes to make his profit has got to ship his goods by a railroad to its ultimate destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.636" offset="12361958">So the union throws a picket line around the railroad spur at which Employer A's products would normally be loaded into the freight car."</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.087" offset="12391737">The purpose of that picket line is to induce the railway employees to refuse to load that stuff for handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.670" offset="12418069">The Board has said that under the present language, that is not a violation because railroad employees and railroad employers are not employees or employees under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.514" offset="12457462">Now, under this new bill instead of using the term "to cease doing business with another employer" it says, "to cease doing business with other person, person includes everybody that closes that loophole."</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.241" offset="12860374">Formally, Section 8(b)(4) did not apply to inducement of the employees or the employers not covered by the National Labor Relations Act as amended, citing International Rice Milling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.307" offset="12900603">The new Act prohibits inducement of employees of any person engaged in commerce including railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.090" offset="12927770">Now, as I noted earlier, the Board decision in International Rice Milling referred to by now Justice Goldberg, continents the same type of adjacent spur picketing as it's involved in this case on the facts identical in the adjacent spur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.221" offset="13000286">Rice Milling went to the Fifth Circuit and on this aspect of the case, the Fifth Circuit reversed and on remand, the Board without further comment enforced the secondary boycott prescriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.377" offset="13072906">The Fifth Circuit differing with the Board on the question of construction of who was covered by the Act or not but as to the business of whether or not a secondary boycott was involved, there was no word of dissent raised by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.073" offset="13127659">Similarly in 1960, an identical situation occurred on the Great Northern Railway case where the Board found adjacent spur picketing not covered by the earlier Act because of the definition of employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.861" offset="13190771">This went to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.765" offset="13198399">The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded and here again without a word of dissent, the Board enforced the prescriptions and held that this type of picketing was indeed covered by the prohibitions of 8(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.601" offset="13265795">So we say that what the Congress dealt with here in amending the Act in 1959 was the identical problem that we're talking about here convincing the Board that railroad employees were subject to the Act indeed and paying not further attention to the fundamental question of whether or not it's secondary boycott because everyone assumed it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.424" offset="13377076">Now, if indeed it was the intent of the Congress to close a gapping loophole, what is sought here is to enlarge that old loophole very substantially indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.156" offset="13471953">This additional comment about the General Electric case as I have noted earlier, it clearly is a common-situs situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.905" offset="13506957">It is General Electric's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.563" offset="13521586">And in that case, this Court simply placed additional restrictions on primary situs picketing, added rules as to what must be done if a reserved gate occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.585" offset="13585742">In General Electric, this Court dealt with Crystal Market Palace, Crystal Palace Market with more dry dock and by inference at least the proof of these and in each.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.517" offset="13641435">The basic principle is stated that it is an obligation of a union engaged in a primary labor dispute to minimize the impact of its picketing on secondary employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.725" offset="13694307">And certainly here, if the steelworkers union was entitled to picket west of Thompson Road removed from the Carrier property, then why could it not picket on the westerly city limits of Syracuse or on the westerly limits of Grand Central Station in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.508" offset="13777377">Indeed, in this case, if the Court please, for the first time, for the very first time, as it was enunciated here by Mr. Manoli with the Court apply an Oedometer test to whether or no the picketing was primary or secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.417" offset="13845086">The test under the statute is the purpose and the purpose here was clear, to induce New York Central employees and to coerce the New York Central Railroad not to handle Carrier's goods and this Your Honors is prescribed by the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerry D. Anker</label>
            <text syncTime="3469.633" offset="13981863">I would just like to comment on two points which you have been made by Mr. Kammholz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.103" offset="14003806">One and the first really was the question has been dealt with both by the Court and by Mr. Kammholz, the question of the relevance of where the picketing takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.836" offset="14046751">The other point I want to deal with is the question of loophole closing with respect to railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.582" offset="14073710">Turning to the first point first, the statute that we're dealing with is not at least, portion of it that applies to this case, does not regulate picketing as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.005" offset="14119372">It prohibits inducing employees to take certain conduct for certain purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.075" offset="14151659">Now, I think you can clarify this question of what the relevance of the location of the picketing is if we look at another form of inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.458" offset="14189171">Picketing, it's clear for purposes of what we're talking about now, is just one of several kind of inducement, another kind is letter writing, another kind is speech making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.339" offset="14224697">Now, suppose the union had made a speech to the brotherhood of railroad trainmen at their union hall at the westerly boundary of Syracuse if you like and had said "please do not, please do not make deliveries and pickups at the Carrier plant."</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.180" offset="14300139">That conduct is lawful or not for the same reason that the conduct in this case is lawful or not, has nothing to do with where the speech was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.566" offset="14333680">Question is, "are you asking for the employees to do something which the Act is intended to prevent you from asking them to do?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.156" offset="14363982">Now, the location of picketing has one point, has one aspect which is not present when you're talking about a public address, of course, and that is that Mr. Justice Black has made this point that the picket is requesting usually at a particular place where the picketing takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.386" offset="14452903">Therefore, many, many cases which you will read will rely as a point of evidence on where the picketing took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.002" offset="14483414">If we did picket the depot, the normal inference would be we were asking for strike action, refusals to work at the depot, and that would be illegal, that's why the location of the picketing is relevant not in itself but as evidence of what the union was asking people to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.915" offset="14554990">In this case, it's perfectly clear and conceded by Mr. Kammholz, what we were trying to get people to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.855" offset="14582784">We were trying to get railroad people to stop servicing Carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.693" offset="14598144">Now, that may be lawful, we believe it is, the Board believes it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.542" offset="14613504">That may be unlawful, but it has nothing to do with where we make that request or engage in that inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.580" offset="14637641">That whole issue of title of the property and location of the picketing has nothing to do with the statute or the issue in this case and that's why Mr. Manoli says that's a fortuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.354" offset="14676825">It just makes no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3648.056" offset="14695633">Undoubtedly -- undoubtedly, these people would have a right to go into the brotherhood to make a speech if their brotherhood wanted them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.379" offset="14728861">But there might be times when they were at the place but it didn't have the right to be, to speak or not to speak.</text>

          <turn speaker="jerry_d_anker" startTime="3660.894" stopTime="3742.859">
            <label>Mr. Jerry D. Anker</label>
            <text syncTime="3660.894" offset="14746937">Well, I -- that's true but not under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.921" offset="14759058">I make this point in a general way that under this statute and under the -- as it has been interpreted by this Court in General Electric, when the union is appealing or inducing to -- appealing to or inducing employees of other employees, there is one test and that test is, is the union simply asking those people to refrain from work related to the primary employers' operations or is it asking them to do something else, engage in some other kind of stoppage which is injurious to their employer and which has nothing to do with the -- directly with the operations of the employer that's on strike, that's the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.420" offset="14917047">Now, to the extent that the location of picketing is relevant, in applying that test is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.712" offset="14942229">But in this case, the location of the picketing has nothing to do with it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.723" offset="14958216">Now, turning to the other point very briefly on the -- what the Act -- the 1959 Amendments intended to do when they closed loopholes, I want to correct Mr. Kammholz on a couple of factual statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.669" offset="15010043">First of all, a quotation by Mr. Goldwater, it's not Mr. Goldwater.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.533" offset="15025507">It is something which Mr. Goldwater inserted in the record after the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.002" offset="15043375">The words are not his, the words or the words of one of the members of the staff of the Senate Labor Committee specifically the Republican Minority Council.</text>

            <text syncTime="3744.327" offset="15080678">Goldwater, yes, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.129" offset="15091858">On the rights -- on the -- the Rice Milling decision for whatever relevance it has, the facts of that case were not the same as this because insofar as railroad picketing was concerned, the union was -- the union picketing interfered with deliveries not only to the struck employers but also other employers who had nothing to do with the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.254" offset="15196348">The union picketed a point of the railroad which just stops railroad operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.502" offset="15213380">And the reference on that is 84 N.L.R.B. 369 where that fact stated very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.338" offset="15244727">As to the Great Northern case which was a later case, I agree, that case is on all force with this one on its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.442" offset="15277119">And it -- it come from the period when the Board define a secondary boycott as any request to employees of other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.490" offset="15317347">They applied that rule not only in that case but in the General Electric case, in a case which involved truck drivers indeed called McJunkin which is cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.424" offset="15353083">That was the rule at that time, at least the dominant view of most of the Board cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.701" offset="15370219">It has oppositely in light of this Court's decision under General Electric case and therefore has no bearing.</text>
