            <text syncTime="861.489" offset="3549288">Immediately after the jury returned the verdict of guilty, the Judge discharged the jury and still in Open Court, in the presence of the defendant and of his attorney, his attorney then was Court appointed counsel, subsequent counsel was appointed by the Court of Appeals, the Judge discussed the question of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.989" offset="3643329">He explicitly referred to or the alternatives whether he should impose sentence immediately that day, whether he should differ sentence or wait a pre-sentence report or whether he should invoke the provisions of the statute before the Court 4208 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="903.059" offset="3715636">Government counsel expressed his view, defense counsel said the defendant wanted sentencing today.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.009" offset="3743431">The Court engaged in a colloquy directly with defendant at which time the defendant repeated that he wanted to be sentenced here and now.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.209" offset="3780211">He indicated that he didn't want, didn't want the Judge to wait for a pre-sentence report or for the study and report provided for under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.493" offset="3821380">There was further discussion which I need not detail, and ultimately the Judge formally called the defendant to the bench and offered him his right of allocution.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.858" offset="3870804">Defendant reiterated that he had nothing to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.452" offset="3885223">When pressed, he finally said to the Judge, “My remarks ain't fit in your ears.”</text>
            <text syncTime="953.176" offset="3916048">The Judge persisted and the defendant persisted in his refusal to say anything more, he just wanted to get it over with.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.510" offset="3953455">Finally the Court imposed sentence under Section 4208 (b), this time expressly imposing sentence for 20 years for maximum under the statute committing the prisoner for a study as provided in Section (c) of that same provision and for reconsideration in three months after the report of the prison authorities was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.473" offset="4069230">The Court explained what it had done to the defendant and noted that he the Judge would be inclined to follow the prison recommendation since this was really an offence against the prison system one that had occurred while at the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.402" offset="4132968">A formal judgment and commitment was entered that same day which again recited the 20 years sentence the maximum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.829" offset="4186676">Sometime later the defendant filed a motion pro se before the Trial Court for a transcript at the government expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.848" offset="4242787">The Court denied the motion on the ground that the only purpose of furnishing a transcript could be served on appeal, the time for appeal had run and therefore there was no occasion to give the defendant the transcript to the trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.435" offset="4317080">No appeal was taken from that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.660" offset="4337977">Finally on June 9th something just short of six months, the time for the report having been expended in the meantime by the Judge, the report of the prison authorities was received by the Judge recommending that a sentence of five years be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.552" offset="4409553">On June 13, 1963 which is something under six months from the date of the original sentence the Judge entered a new order reducing the 20 years sentence to five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.334" offset="4600665">Finally on April 11th, 1962 many months later the defendants pro se filed a motion under Section 2255 in which he made several allegations with respect to trail errors also alleged that he had been a motion for a mental examination before trial with reference to his competency (Inaudible) and he complained about the Judge's remarks and interrogation of him at the original sentence but he said nothing about the denial of his right to be present at the re-sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.570" offset="4745697">The Court denied the motion without hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.692" offset="4758131">The Court of Appeal -- well on appeal for the first time the defendant raised this question of his right to be present at the modification of sentence in his own presence and presence of his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.808" offset="4822601">The Court of Appeal agreed with the position of the appellant, remanded the case for re-sentencing in the presence of the defendant and with the benefit of counsel, but explicitly did not disturb the underlying conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.225" offset="4900237">There is no vacation of the conviction, merely a remand for re-sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.203" offset="4916224">Petitioner had not sought review from the ruling below insofar as it offends his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.041" offset="4943496">Only the government has petitioned, therefore, the only question before the Court at this time is whether the defendant was entitled to be personally present and to have the assistance of counsel at the modification of sentence which occurred on June 13th 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.179" offset="5024057">We approach this question first as one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.989" offset="5055300">On that basis and insofar as Congress was free to answer the question, it seems to us very clear that it adds it in the negative that it was not necessary to return the defendant before the Judge at the time his sentence would be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.530" offset="5129488">The first congressional report which is the House report which embodies legislation exactly as it now reads is to the point on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.118" offset="5191868">Unfortunately we do not quote in our brief the pertinent potion, though we do refer to it but the report at Page 10 says this, “After receiving from the Director of the Bureau of Prisons a summary of this study the Court in fixing the final penalty may affirm the original sentence or impose a modified sentence under any applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.316" offset="5304613">The prisoner would not have to be present in the Court when this final action on his sentence is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.758" offset="5342438">In as much the original sentence of the Court represents the maximum authorized by statute, any later modifications by the Court would constitute a reduction in the sentence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.986" offset="5387368">There is an ample precedent for this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.690" offset="5398131">The last line of Rule 43 reads the defendants' presence is not required in reduction of a sentence under Rule 35.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.038" offset="6551489">But the statute provides that he personally must be asked if he has anything to say and it -- doesn't that mean for the purpose of litigate punishment if he has anything to say in that regard?</text>

            <text syncTime="1629.181" offset="6620139">We first say that he has already been given a right of allocution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.487" offset="6641351">Now the question here is not when he should be given the right of allocution whether at the time of the first sentencing or at the time of the re-sentencing, he must be given a right of allocution at the time of the first sentencing if only to respect the part of the rule that permits him to state a bar to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.954" offset="6739153">Now the only question remaining if it was -- whether he has the right to repeat his plead of leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.255" offset="6764440">Certainly he can argue that it would be more effective to do so at a time when the Judge is more focusing on the length of the sentence he is going to impose, but we must assume that the decision to invoke 4208 (b) has occurred only after the Judge has listened to the defendant, has appraised the plea (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.695" offset="6878124">We must also assume that the Judge having heard the mitigating facts as presented by the defendant has not forgotten them at the time he re-sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.311" offset="6920652">And he hasn't forgotten them partly because the record itself, the study which has been undertaken evaluates his plea in a meaningful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.383" offset="6976867">It repeats the information which the defendant has given at least if it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.302" offset="7004557">The study itself involves several interviews with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.146" offset="7023992">All of this material is incorporated in a report which is then presented to the Judge, this in itself refreshes the Judge's recollection of what had occurred before, but more importantly to some extent it supersedes what has been told.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.549" offset="7089612">It evaluates the factors in mitigation which have been brought to the Judge's attention initially and its very completeness leaves very little chance of anything pertinent escaping the Judge's attention at the time when he finally imposed the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.863" offset="7170800">Nor can it argued that the defendant has a right to traverse the representations made in the study nor can he be -- nor can a right in him be recognized to debate the question of sentence with the Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.116" offset="7259826">I think the decision in Williams versus New York explains more eloquently than I can why the Judge must act on ex-parte information at the time of sentencing if he is going to really take into the consideration all the relevant factors and why as a practical matter this report – there the question was about a pre-sentence report, here it's even more thorough report why it cannot be divulged, why it cannot be made a subject to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.181" offset="7400051">There is no occasion of the defendant at this late date to add very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.819" offset="7426696">Now we do think the District Judge if he has a question, if he wants to refresh himself, if he wants to impress upon the defendant the punishment he is going to meet out, of course he can recall defendant, many Judges do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.557" offset="7493569">Sentencing institutes and reports of it indicate that several Judges feel that it is a sound practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.796" offset="7530559">I think it also reflects that most of them feel that it is not a rigid, inflexible requirement and in the case we simply argue that it should not that as -- I think Mr. Justice Black said in Williams versus New York there should be no freezing of the sentencing procedure in the mold of the rules of evidence as applicable to trial, I'm paraphrasing it liberally, it's just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.330" offset="7672665">The Judge should be allowed to decide in his own discretion whether any useful purpose would be served by returning the defendant for a further allocution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.721" offset="8902301">The question as I understand it as far as the Behrens' case is concerned is basically whether or not Mr. Behrens was required to be present at the time the final determination was made under 4208 (b)?</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.433" offset="8961128">Of course ancillary to that whether or not at that time it was also necessary that counsel be present?</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.261" offset="8992371">If I understand the government's argument right I believe the government does contend now that if the judgment was not final until the Court had received the report from the Bureau of Prisons under 4208 (b), they concede that Mr. Behrens should have been present and that his counsel should have been present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.151" offset="9079933">I didn't quite interpret their brief that way, but I believe that is the way I have understood the argument on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.356" offset="9104802">It seems to me that it's quite basic and decided in this Court in many decisions of course that a criminal defendant is entitled to be represented by counsel at every stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.976" offset="9155271">I think this is set forth in the rules, Rule 43 of the Federal Rules as the defendant, Rule 44 as to right of counsel and of course this Court in Johnson verses Zerbst 304 US citied in the brief very clearly set that forth and points out that the defendant is entitled to the guiding hand of counsel at all stages of the proceeding under the Sixth Amendment and that the right of counsel is an essential jurisdictional prerequisite to the Court's authority to act, and there are numerous cases following that which are cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.999" offset="9311378">The second point seems to be whether or not in a 4208 (b) proceeding when a sentence is made final, and as I read the statute there is no sentence until after a Court has finally determined after receiving the Bureau of Prison's report, I believe the first proceeding is merely tentative I think that is the obvious intent of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.640" offset="9413883">We can go into a lot of things regarding legislative history, but I think this Court in the case Corey versus United States I think it's in part a dissent but the point is basic and I don't think there was any disagreement on the basic point, clearly sets forth consensus and states that often times it is difficult to determine what the legislative history of an act is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.121" offset="9503848">As is already been pointed out this afternoon the House report says one thing and we have to provide conjecture I believe to assume that the Senate was thinking of the same thing when they passed the bill, but in Corey versus United States I think this statement and substance is made, when it's difficult to determine what the legislative intention was, then the Court should proceed cautiously being sensitive to the rights of the defendant and to the society in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.486" offset="9621295">And perhaps one of the best tools we can use is to apply commonsense to determine what the legislative intent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.156" offset="9652015">It seems to me that in this case if we do apply legislative intent, legislative – if we try and determine the legislative intent we have to apply common sense to those matters, and I don't see as a practical matter how counsel in one of these cases can confidently advise the defendant at the time the Judge first involved 4208 (b) as to what the man should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.664" offset="9753997">I don't believe that there will be many counsel representing these men that would want to tell them to go ahead and start your appeal because we can't tell what's going to happen under this 4208 (b) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.788" offset="9806555">I think it puts the defendant into sort of an indirect compulsion if he is forced to appeal from this tentative sentencing and I think that's all it is when the Court first applies 4208 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.702" offset="9866219">I certainly would not want the responsibility if I could avoid it of having to tell a man to go ahead and appeal even though there maybe a good chance that the man will be given a substantially reduced sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.657" offset="9913971">Of course that has occurred in the Corey case or it's possible that he may even receive probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.139" offset="9939884">I think and these men, their hope springs eternal they all think they are going to get complete probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.913" offset="9959006">We know as a practical matter, that not too many of them do, but that's a feeling that these men are going to have I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.738" offset="9994324">So how are they going to be in position to make an intelligent decision to go ahead and appeal at a time like that when there really hasn't been any final determination at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.714" offset="10186271">As the government has pointed out it's usually six months before this final report is in, or maybe from three to six months supposing the man at that time is (Inaudible), supposing that he wants to do better perhaps the man has had a mental problem and this has been helped by the psychiatric treatment he has had while in the custody of Bureau of Prisons, I think these are things that should be called to the Court's attention at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.386" offset="11208913">I think some of the problems that we have and I am going back a little bit to some of the matters connected with the Corey case because the two of course are still tied up together, it's difficult to separate them, but I think we have a difficulty if the final sentencing, which I believe is the only sentencing under 4208 (b) is not the one that we have to appeal from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.872" offset="11306820">I think if we have to appeal from the tentative commitment, and I think that's all it actually is, the case goes up to the Court of Appeals and Court of Appeals of course doesn't know what the sentence is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.791" offset="11362513">I think we may get into the problem of separate appeals, two appeals on the case, one on the case initially and then perhaps the second appeal where the sentence perhaps is in some case is unreasonable and the Court of Appeals or this Court would need to apply its discretionary powers to review sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.818" offset="11438686">I know this would not happen often but it certainly can happen in certain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.450" offset="11461151">I think it would be unfortunate for the Court of Appeals to have to decide on appeal without knowing what the sentence is going to be and there is a problem also where this concurrent sentence is involved on several different counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.476" offset="11513292">Under this why you would -- the Court of Appeals apparently will have to consider perhaps some error under a concurrent sentence on an unchallenged count that they wouldn't decide if they don't want the sentence the Judge was going to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.894" offset="11578911">I think it presents many, almost intolerable problems that I don't believe necessarily arrives if we go by what I concede understandably the established rule of law that a sentence is not final until there is nothing else that's to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.519" offset="11657488">Of course I think one of the leading cases on that is Corey versus United States and I don't really believe that there is any serious question about that, it's been borrowed repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.745" offset="11706389">I think it's quite clear the final judgment, a criminal case means these sentences and in this particular case I think the Trial Judge in his words and it's set out in the brief realized that he wasn't making a final sentence on this man when the commitment was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.197" offset="11780159">Here is the words of the Trail Judge when he made this commitment in the beginning and this is what the Trial Judge said, explaining this to Mr. Behrens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.749" offset="11810356">He says, “And I think after about three months, when everybody has had an opportunity to reflect upon your case quite fairly that we should be able to come up with a same civil disposition of your case,” like the Trial Judge himself recognized -- he wasn't making these sentence when this man was committed under 4208 (b) and I think the statute itself it says these sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.030" offset="11907532">In the first paragraph, the first sentence of 4208 (b) says these sentences, what it actually shall be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.152" offset="11956015">Going back to Corey versus United States, another case of course before that and one of the leading one, leading ones is Berman versus United States cited in the brief and of course there the point again arises during the pendency of an appeal from a sentence the District Court is without jurisdiction to modify its judgment by resentencing the defendant, resentence is the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.474" offset="12045249">As I understand these previous opinions of this Court there can only be the one sentence and there is this sentence, as into final one, I think we're in real problems when the Court later comes in and tries to in effect re-sentence under this 4208 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.199" offset="12112123">But I think the practical approach to the whole thing is that there be a determination of the time that the appeal is to run from.</text>
