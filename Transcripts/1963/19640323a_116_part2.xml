            <text syncTime="5.095" offset="123800">Mr. Chief Justice, I will continue only for a minute or two because I want to reserve five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.021" offset="143444">I simply want to say first that with reference to Gordon against Texas and its citation both of Carter and the Twenty-first Amendment, I think it's very clear that this indicates not only that this Court is ready to invoke the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.002" offset="219408">But that even in situations of this kind, even where a test of reasonableness might be imposed such as in Carter, this Court will also dispose of the issue on the reasonableness of the state regulation under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.275" offset="280430">But what I want most to emphasize is that there is here at this late date an issue of state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.363" offset="312822">Now, I should have thought that this issue of state power was disposed of and removed after cases like Young's Market, Mahoney against Triner and Ziffrin.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.373" offset="352841">And there are today, at this late date, nevertheless, attempts not only in this case but you will find in Texas, in California, elsewhere in the State of New York and probably elsewhere in the nation that they are all looking through this case to see whether this Court will permit the erosion of state power under the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles H. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="91.360" offset="468825">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.138" offset="487946">In order to -- in epitome get the facts clearly before Your Honors, I'm going to just read the findings made by the Liquor Authority itself in submitting the question to the Attorney General and by the Attorney General in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.697" offset="582196">We go along to those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.216" offset="596198">Now to have said that as it's been said here a moment ago, because of some stays, they -- the Liquor Authority was barred from an adequate investigational facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.533" offset="645517">The Liquor Authority has been over our place time and time and time again at all our records.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.535" offset="673520">Now, the Liquor Authority on May 9th, 1960 submitted a letter to the Attorney General asking for his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.763" offset="726392">And in describing the facts, they referred to this business by the plaintiff under the sanction and in fact, through the use of the United States Government, Treasury Department said, "Traffic in alcoholic beverages having a situs actually or constructively without the State are not intended for use or delivery within the State."</text>
            <text syncTime="189.497" offset="861393">That's the Liquor Authority's own language after its investigation of our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.916" offset="886993">Now then, the Attorney General responded to that on June 30th, 1960 on page 17 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.790" offset="934536">He said the facts are -- and then having described the diameter and so forth of our premises as the Idlewild, he goes on to say a portion of the lease premises, the premises are leased from the by State Agency, the New York Port Authority which by the way has in its lease which is part of the record a provision that no liquor shall be sold in these lease premises except in-bond liquor for export.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.676" offset="1090121">Now a portion of -- says the Attorney General, "A portion of the leased space will be use for storage and display of the liquor particularly by the Corporation from suppliers, from stock held by the suppliers in-bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.981" offset="1159293">And will remain under bond and under supervision of the Bureau of Customs at all times until delivery to the airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.206" offset="1212165">The liquor is to be shipped by the lessee from the United States on the plane on which the passenger departs but it's not to be delivered to the passenger until he reaches his foreign destination."</text>
            <text syncTime="293.831" offset="1278725">Shipments is to be -- shipment is to be made on documents approved for export by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.958" offset="1327208">The United States Bureau of Customs has indicated that it treats this transaction as an export within the meaning of Section 311, now 1311 of the Tariff Act of 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.257" offset="1400351">Now, the practical issue and it embodies the legal issue in this case was stated by the court below in a single sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.271" offset="1444446">The plaintiff will be put out of business by the Liquor Authority unless it is accessible in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.044" offset="1475584">In other words, this is not a case where the Liquor Authority is trying to invoke some section of the local law for the purpose of supervision or as in some of the cases which have come before this Court in the past where there has been a State requirement of a permit in order to let the State know who is doing the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.551" offset="1585612">Those have been deemed reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.892" offset="1590941">But here as they claimed throughout the brief and today is that there is to be unconditional elimination not only because of the plaintiff's business but of the Government's sanction, Federal Government's sanction and use of the -- of this method in furtherance of its policies for the regulation of foreign commerce and in the national interest, I'll come to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.401" offset="1720926">Now, the Liquor Authority's brief opens with two points, their points, and they're asking this Court to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.566" offset="1761677">The first is on page 25 -- page 11 or rather of their -- of the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.716" offset="1794278">Four pages are devoted to arguing before this Court that appellee's liquor operations are clearly encompassed by the language of the New York's Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.730" offset="1854255">I dispute that and I've always dispute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.169" offset="1876093">And they say now that if the matter is to be considered by this Court, they want to fall back on the equitable extension -- abstention doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.984" offset="1943280">Notwithstanding that at the opening of their case in the court below, they said two things, first that we wish to have the Court understand that we withdraw our third affirmative defense, which is the defense of equitable abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.473" offset="2037217">They asked to withdraw that.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.447" offset="2161142">Mr. Galt, I won't read it, that's his.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.807" offset="2178591">Now consequently, we have the Government's -- the Attorney General's case resting on two points, success for both of which is essential to their total success.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.205" offset="2260198">The first is that to use their language of their heading, that the local law clearly encompasses what is being done and works a prohibition on it, and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="560.068" offset="2343685">The words are directly in the opinion of the Attorney General whose opinion I've already called Your Honors' attention in which he says, "As the predicate for his own conclusion of complete elimination, there is no provision for a license for this type of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.113" offset="2447862">Any suggestion that may have come here that somehow really we can get a license is mistaken."</text>
            <text syncTime="593.827" offset="2478686">Here, we have a construction by the Attorney General as the basis of his decision that there is no provision in the local law for this type of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.388" offset="2536887">Now what type of transaction is referred to?</text>
            <text syncTime="611.893" offset="2550993">I've already read it from the Liquor Authority's letter to the Attorney General in which it says it's in, "Alcoholic beverages having a situs actually or constructively without the State and not intended to be used or delivered within the State."</text>

            <text syncTime="640.174" offset="2664051">You'll find that right near the top there.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.250" offset="2680351">First full paragraph on page 161.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.470" offset="2701249">Now, the second proposition is that having claimed that the local law in -- clearly encompasses this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.828" offset="2758719">Their second proposition is, and I'll read it from their own language.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.041" offset="2783587">While he is taken from their former brief when this case was before the Court, the same language is reflected in their present brief and it's this broad generalization, regulation of the liquor traffic in the State, by the State is paramount to the Federal Government's right to regulate whether under the constitutional provisions concerning commerce, exports and imports and supremacy or under statutory and regulatory provisions of a preemptive character.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.867" offset="2934888">I'm unable to find any case in this Court or in any other court that has any such broad general assertion which were deprived the right of the United States as a nation to deal with foreign commerce with the rest of the world and above all to make reciprocal arrangements since it was done in this case without a country.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.616" offset="3057873">Now following to this -- matter of these two claims, it goes back to the beginning of their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.636" offset="3097893">At the opening, they've filed a motion to dismiss our complaint for a failure to state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.208" offset="3136240">You'll find that on record 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.656" offset="3150033">And then they embodied the same claim that we stated no claim on which redress could be given in their second offense, 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.985" offset="3187336">Now, the time when this case was before this Court previously, that was a question which was raised in defense of the actions below which was -- were raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.381" offset="3260897">And this Court said and I quote, 370 U.S, "Assuredly, the complaint at least formally alleges that basis for equitable relief."</text>
            <text syncTime="802.226" offset="3312306">Now, the fact is, that the basic facts, the basic facts that are stated in our complaint in which induce that language by the Court, this Court, were all proven at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.655" offset="3382000">Now, the peculiarity of this trial was that the Liquor Authority never put a witness on the stand, never introduced an exhibit, and never disputed the authenticity of the volume of forms by the Customs Bureau which we put in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.115" offset="3483878">And in consequence, the findings of fact below rest upon undisputed documentary evidence showing unquestionably that this is the action of the U.S. Bureau of Customs established under the authorization of the Treasury Department for the purpose of furthering the interest of the United States as stated in the title of the Tariff Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.362" offset="3652838">An Act to provide revenue to regular -- regulate commerce with foreign countries, to encourage the industries of the United States, to protect American labor, and for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.229" offset="3716263">Now, this in-bond liquor is sold tax-free and you can readily see the relation point of view of policy to those objectives stated in the title tax-free, which it means a difference -- a differential of about $3 a bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.818" offset="3834650">And consequently, there is encouragement to our travelers particularly in the economy class to purchase one or two bottles tax-free, but in-bond for export only.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.285" offset="3920541">Now, another thing that is striking, it is the finding of fact by the court below that in all of these because of the fact that this is business conducted in effect by the United States Bureau of Customs itself through us at that one little spot in the arrivals building which is by the way is in the center of the U.S. Customs Bureau headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.845" offset="4070797">As the president of the company says, "We do our business in a goldfish bowl, in the middle of a police station."</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.722" offset="4106219">And the finding of fact was that there is not only no allegation in the -- in the Attorney General's answer but there isn't a particle of evidence that in the four years that this operation has been running, even a single bottle ever got diverted into the city -- into the State of New York, ever became part of the common mass in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.992" offset="4239339">It all moved from bonded warehouse, in-bond, bonded trucker through and the bonded truckers bill of consignment, it was not to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.109" offset="4291793">I can't stop to show or call your attention to the forms but the long series are all exempt in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.789" offset="4326484">The release from the ware -- bonded warehouse is on form 7512, which is in evidence here, and it's a form which requires that the liquor be consigned to the Collector of Customs at this -- to the actual airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.201" offset="4420211">And the trucker receives a form which require -- he is in-bond requires him to transport that and deliver it to the Collector of Customs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.837" offset="4474755">Now consequently, the perspective here is not at all that presented to Your Honors in the first instance here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.188" offset="4512162">It is that we are the creature as it were which is being used by the United States Government because somebody has to sell if this policy is operated at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.556" offset="4569631">We are the creature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.385" offset="7396916">But on the contrary, it argues for the proposition that the legislature never attempted to touch foreign commerce and that's exactly what the courts have said which I'll quote in a moment from our own State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.301" offset="7456580">But then, this introductory statement of purpose goes on to say that it is for the protection, health, welfare and safety of the people of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.521" offset="7593462">Now, they cite a section which says this, "No person shall manufacture for sale or sell in wholesale or retail any alcoholic beverage within the State."</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.385" offset="7644871">They keep overlooking those words, "within the State."</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.147" offset="7659917">In other words, the relation of the liquor must be to the common mass in the State because that is the -- first place, the limitation on the constitutional powers of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.039" offset="7715506">In the second place, any legislature would certainly have some such policy very clearly in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.155" offset="7744031">Now, our courts in the two cases, I'm afraid Mr. Galt has cited those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.042" offset="7771512">They are both liquor cases and they both involved the matter of the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.000" offset="7811323">When you read the opinions in it you'll see, and the second case citing the holding in the first case puts it in the sentence, neither do the regulatory powers of the State Liquor Authority extend to international transactions, even to alcoholic beverages except sales for domestic consumption in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.184" offset="7896064">Now, I'd tackle the time limitations Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.396" offset="7908916">I must leave a whole and interesting subject to what the Twenty-first Amendment means to my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.664" offset="7942040">And I think that you will find that I have a collection of authorities by this Court saying expressly that where the transportation is solely through the State and not intended to use the Liquor Authorities' own words, for use or delivery within the State that it is not affected by the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.541" offset="8041514">Because otherwise, it wouldn't be a nation and we'd be at the mercy of every coastal state on the Atlantic and Pacific Seaboard.</text>
