            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 115, General Motors Corporation, Appellant, versus Washington, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.290" offset="288580">Mr. Barnes, you may proceed with your argument now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_k_barnes" startTime="50.748" stopTime="418.335">
            <label>Mr. Donald K. Barnes</label>
            <text syncTime="50.748" offset="306343">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.453" offset="321181">This appeal challenges the constitutionality of unapportioned gross receipts tax assessment made by the State of Washington against General Motors Corporation with respect to exclusively interstate commerce, and it challenges that assessment on two grounds, interstate commerce and due process and two points under each.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.088" offset="403728">Rather startling new law would be created by affirmance of this decision, the statute under which the assessments were made have been in effect for 20 years and have been as it's going on for longer than that before this issue was raised and there's no precedent for it anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.745" offset="482304">Reversal however, requires only the application of familiar principles denied particularly extraordinary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.256" offset="516368">Well, the prior decisions of this Court in state tax matters indicate that there are two things that need to be kept in mind carefully, now I want to mention those before I go into the details of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.362" offset="564851">The first is the nature of the tax that makes a lot of difference as we look at each precedent and each set of facts, and second, as to the facts not only what was done but where it was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.957" offset="623156">This tax is one which is imposed specifically by the statute and directed to be a burden upon the vendor for the privilege of engaging in the business of making sales at wholesale and measured by unapportioned gross receipts derived or related to those sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.326" offset="712704">Now, the circumstances to which a tax of that nature can constitutionally be applied are considerably narrower than the circumstances which will support any apportioned tax including, best example, and that income tax even though that's paid by the vendor also, or a consumption tax, the sales or use tax which is paid by the vendee.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.764" offset="810402">Now, the facts here are that, although constitutionally from constitutional point of view very simple, they're quite detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.475" offset="841226">General Motors Corporation is a Delaware Corporation that's qualified to do business in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.451" offset="861184">Its business is manufacturing primarily automobiles and parts and accessories therefore and some of the -- those products are involved in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.572" offset="901622">There are many other products which are not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.853" offset="914787">The selling which the Corporation does is incidental to and a part of its manufacturing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.210" offset="940178">We are not, in other words, a merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.428" offset="953135">The Corporation is organized into divisions and conducts its business through divisions which is still not separately incorporated are substantially independent of each other and in fact to a considerable degree in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.684" offset="1010082">This appeal involves transactions of only at Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and General Motors Parts Divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.486" offset="1041324">The first three manufacturing automobiles by that name, Chevrolet also trucks and General Motors Parts supplying parts and accessories for service requirements of dealers in the aftermarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.898" offset="1086986">You will recognize that Chevrolet and Pontiac for example are in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.087" offset="1107675">Now, in the State of Washington, there are no manufacturing facilities for any part of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.166" offset="1135992">There are, however, offices of some of the other divisions which are not involved in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.988" offset="1159293">They either are concerned with other products or they're concerned with entirely different activities such as financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.484" offset="1185311">The tax on all of the transactions that are related in any way to those offices, has been paid without dispute and is not here involved in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.811" offset="1226585">There is in the State, no office of any kind having any relation to any of the tax receipts in the first of two classes of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.779" offset="1270471">In the second class, there is a small branch which will be mentioned in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.577" offset="1301713">Now, the transactions which are here in -- in dispute, all concerned products which are manufactured entirely outside of the State, sold entirely outside of the State, delivered outside of the State to common carriers, paid for outside of the State, and shipped into the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.927" offset="1375065">They're all sales at wholesale to independent dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.845" offset="1394709">Now, the sales organization, since we are talking about a tax on the business of selling is of immediate concern, and it's the same for each of these three principal divisions, although each is independent of the other, each has a national headquarters in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.287" offset="1468479">Each has a -- a regional West Coast Office in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.476" offset="1485302">Each has its lowest organizational office in Portland, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.673" offset="1506095">Now, that zone office in each case covers a territory of all of State of Washington, all of Oregon, all of Alaska, and variously parts of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.520" offset="1549458">The personnel at Pontiac office, and similarly in the Olds office run from 20 to 22 people and that gets up to 40 in the case of Chevrolet as it's quite apparent, that's very thin coverage for so large a territory as we've just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.584" offset="1617690">Those people worked in most -- most of them in and some in and out of the offices in Portland, but there are two classes of employees belonging to those offices, who are assigned specific territories within the zone and reside in those territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.052" offset="1687594">Those are the service representatives and the so-called district managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.041" offset="1703581">Now, combining those two groups, the maximum in Washington at any one time that is stationed in Washington, was the Pontiac division 3, Oldsmobile 6, and Chevrolet 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.818" offset="1754676">The zone manager responsible for having the right dealers in the right place to this --</text>

            <text syncTime="689.494" offset="2861328">He gets a lot more from headquarters offices in Michigan as to where dealership should be placed to meet the market effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.550" offset="2897586">And then he makes recommendations to the region and headquarters offices where the selections are approved, then he executes a dealer selling agreement which is a rather formal document, he executes that at his office in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.000" offset="2959339">It defines the relationship which will exist from then on between the manufacturer and the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.854" offset="2982745">And the dealer is an -- an independent customer of the corporation, not its agent nor its emissary in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.405" offset="3012942">The dealer provides his own premises, his own inventory, his own tools, his own personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.149" offset="3035930">His new car inventory is usually financed and sometimes that's done by General Motors Acceptance Corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.308" offset="3076577">And of course, if the tax is due and that finance business are paid at General Motors Acceptance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.618" offset="3097893">In a few cases, part of the fixed capital which is a very heavy requirement for a new dealership is supplied temporarily by Motors Holding Division, which is another and separate Division of General Motors Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.919" offset="3155048">It again, pays the taxes on its own transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.032" offset="3167483">Now, the dealers' business is retailing new cars, parts and accessories which he buys from General Motors Corporation and other related products which he buys from others such as tires, used cars, fuel, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.768" offset="3222444">And sometimes, the dealers carry competing lines of automobiles, I mean not competing lines of our own but a competing lines of other unrelated manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.592" offset="3269778">A dealer sells where he pleases and sets his own resale prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.222" offset="3288273">But under the contract, he has a duty to develop the market for his particular line of car in that vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.543" offset="3317530">And to that end, he's required to have adequate premises, personnel, stock, capital, tools and signs, uniform accounting, so that his results can be compared or at least uniform financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.111" offset="3363819">The result of accounting which can be compared with other dealerships to detect financial weaknesses and so forth and he must submit a number of reports, the most important to which are for the purpose of assisting the corporations' production planning because automobiles as you know are sold to make, that is the are made-to-order Chevrolet alone could make 2 -- 2,000,000 different kinds of automobiles under all the options which are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.283" offset="3476459">After the agreement has been entered into, the function of the zone office and all its personnel is to assist the dealer in any way he can to make his operation profitable and to check his performance of the agreement and see that he lives up to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.029" offset="3539466">Financial matters are approached through these financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.244" offset="3560364">The -- there's advice given also on proper development and utilization of sales personnel and sales methods, similarly on service procedures and the handling of service complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.888" offset="3610937">Most of the principles which go into this advice and the details of it for that matter are developed by staffs in the zone, region and headquarters offices but are then delivered by the district managers or service representatives through their regular visits to the dealers which they make, or as often as once a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.778" offset="3686484">In the case of larger dealers, sometimes less for the smaller ones and there also, they pick up the dealers' complaints and questions and carry them into the other offices for technical assistance and handle what they can on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.401" offset="3741027">There are -- these business provided the -- these two people are supplemented by irregular visits by the zone manager himself, by the department heads in his office, and by personnel from other offices and experts that are brought in for special cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.069" offset="3799646">Now, the reports that the dealer is required to submit begin with a ten-day report, and on that, every ten days, he reports to the zone office the unit sales, that is the number of automobiles he has sold during the past 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.910" offset="3858996">The inventory has left at the end of the ten days.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.251" offset="3872371">This is used for the development of this projection -- economic projecting trends which you -- if you watch the new -- automobile reports of all the newspapers will show you every ten days, they're boasting about how good business is because of what happened during the last ten days by putting all these reports countrywide together.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.617" offset="3949798">Financial statements, I mentioned before, is submitted monthly.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.136" offset="3963904">And the interesting one which is insisted upon by Chevrolet and it's usual in the case of Pontiac, is a 90-day projection.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.060" offset="3999640">The district manager and the dealer sit down together in the dealers' place of business and make up this projection.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.441" offset="4025135">And that estimates the number of cars which the dealer will need to order for each month for the next three months, as revised each month.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.305" offset="4064632">The purpose of course, is production planning for the reason already mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.053" offset="4083545">Now, the zone office consolidates these reports from all the dealers on its zone and passes on to the factory the consolidation, not the individual reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.513" offset="4125445">Oldsmobile doesn't -- has this procedure on its books but at least the zone office in Portland has said that they find little occasion to use if they may, the estimates by their own personnel in their own office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.486" offset="4177272">At least that they are not orders as you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.033" offset="4187512">Now, the sales procedure starts with an order, it's really a purchase procedure by the dealer which is sent by the dealer of the zone office in almost all cases by mail, though occasionally, he may telephone in an urgent one, and occasionally, the district manager happens to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.744" offset="4250311">He'll hand it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.501" offset="4253341">Now, the district manager carried it into the zone office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.635" offset="4265880">The zone office records these things and then forwards them to proper factory, and they have to make a choice there because not all models are made at all factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.230" offset="4304332">Some may be made in California, most of them are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.276" offset="4316453">A few come only from Missouri, and some have to be shipped from Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.284" offset="4332544">The proper factory to which the order is sent, accepts or rejects the order and acceptance or rejection is no formality in this situation, again, because of the wide variety of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.528" offset="4381445">There are many times that the factory cannot make the particular order that has -- particular car that has been ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.608" offset="4409762">It must reject the order and request the dealer to submit something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.622" offset="4429824">The factory notifies the dealer, it then schedules the car for production which takes a matter of two to three weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.640" offset="4457932">If everything is on time, it receives payment when time comes for delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.840" offset="4474755">And then having received payment, it makes delivery to a common carrier that will be the factory passing the title at that point and consigned to the dealer in this case in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.259" offset="4528358">Now as you see from this description, there is ordinarily no solicitation of orders, although I think that point is a matter of complete immateriality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.769" offset="4562422">The retail demand for automobiles is created wisely by the dealer activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.108" offset="4583842">He does a lot of soliciting, and supplemented by the national advertising which is placed at entirely with -- at Michigan and then of course distributed by the media not by us to all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.700" offset="4642147">The dealer will buy all of the cars that he can sell, so it becomes unnecessary to solicit from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.377" offset="4664926">If we can get him to make the sales to the retail customers, the wholesale business follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.029" offset="4691466">The corporation personnel do not contact the dealer's customers except to referee an occasional service complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.772" offset="4730441">The trial court divided the transactions into two classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.167" offset="4747995">And the first class, it put all sales by Oldsmobile, all sales by Pontiac, all sales by General Motors Parts Division, and Chevrolet sales to dealers in the nine southern counties of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.657" offset="4802017">Now, as to these transactions, no Washington office of any kind had any contact, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.860" offset="4826781">And in the case of General Motors Parts Division, although with there's -- no point was made on this in the trial court, it appears on evidence, the court -- I mean the Division has no field personnel at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.854" offset="4874742">All its men stay right on the warehouse and simply receive a field orders at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.290" offset="4900551">A second class -- no, the trial court held the assessment in -- unconstitutional as to all these first class of transactions and was reversed by the Washington Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.203" offset="4948198">The second class of transactions involves only sales by Chevrolet Division to dealers located in counties other than the nine southern counties of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.809" offset="4994591">And the sole difference between those transactions and the others is that as to those dealers, to whom those sales were made, there was within the State a one-man branch office, this one man had a secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.283" offset="5048508">He had a territory which included all of that part of Washington which I've mentioned plus all of Alaska and part of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.635" offset="5077870">He had no contact with any other personnel and no part in the activity which I previously described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.647" offset="5105977">His procedure was -- his function was to hold hands as he said, “The dealers in that territory,” and primarily to expedite deliveries of this car shipped from California and so forth during a period of short supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.424" offset="5161044">Both lower courts held the assessments constitutional as to the sales to those dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.737" offset="5186330">Now, the activities in and out of Washington, wholly out of Washington are the engineering designed procurement, manufacture of the automobiles, the financial management, general management, the placement of the advertisement, the sales procedures, so far as General Motors is concerned, that is the receipt and acceptance of the orders, the delivery of the product and receive the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.098" offset="5271803">Now, partly out of the State and partly within it is this function of selecting and appointing dealers in the first place, the rendering of advice and assistant to the dealers and checking on the dealer performance, most of which as we said was done at the leg-work level by the resident district manager and is assisted sometimes by the service manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.597" offset="5353723">That's a long recitation of facts but there is much detail and yet very little in substance that can't be said very briefly to recapitulate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.344" offset="5400743">Automobiles, parts and accessories are manufactured, sold and delivered entirely out-of the state and shipped to customers within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.104" offset="5431777">No new -- there is no related intrastate commerce of any kind and there is no local office of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.560" offset="5461661">The local activity by traveling representatives in furtherance is in furtherance of out-of-state sales and that is the only instate activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.807" offset="5494575">The exceptions, of course, are the one-man office previously mentioned relating to deliveries of the second class, and there is no field personnel at all for General Motors Parts Division and like characterizations hereafter will be subject to those two exceptions to avoid repetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.938" offset="5567091">Now, the formulation and application of constitutional rules in this area depends upon the incidence and to some extent upon the incidence and impact of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.281" offset="5608469">It is said that the purpose of taxes is to pay for benefits to the taxpayer or at least to a class on which the taxpayer is a member and that they should, therefore, bear some physical relation to the benefits and protection which are conferred by the Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.166" offset="5668028">And the basis of tax was distinguished from its purpose is a privilege or a property or an activity, or something which is within the jurisdiction of the taxing authority, and the tax, therefore, should bear some relationship to that privilege or property or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.066" offset="5731662">Now, the Washington Court, in approaching this problem, we are sure was mistaken in its application of economic principles and that is why it strained to avoid the constitutional rules which have been established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.729" offset="5798327">It fell for this market state concept, that is, “Market provides the income and the State is therefore entitled to some payment for protecting the market,” and or it goes on with the -- the vendor is taking money out of the State when he sells products into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.335" offset="5872724">Now, that type of argument is unsound on all accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.941" offset="5887143">And as this Court has frequently observed, income is produced not by the market but by capital or labor and both combined and therefore is produced where the capital and labor or both combined or expended and not where the customer happens to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.549" offset="5949524">The State's protection to the market is protection to the customers, not to the vendor or only very incidentally, to the vendor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.351" offset="5984737">All states of course are equally producer in markets so that this argument about taking money out of the market is completely fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.342" offset="6012740">The value which is put on the State equals value taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.397" offset="6024965">It's no more reasonable to say that General Motors takes money out of Washington than to say that Washington takes automobiles away from General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.152" offset="6052028">Both statements are equally absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.784" offset="6062477">Now, the Court inadvertently perhaps explains its action, its opinion by relying to uphold the tax upon the presence of the customer and upon the fact that he reads the newspapers, "Beam in national advertisement," the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.405" offset="6124962">Now, it's perfectly reasonable as Mr. Justice Rutledge has had occasioned to point out that a tax which is paid by the customer, that is a consumer tax, like a use tax, should be paid to the consumer's state because it's the consumer who's getting the benefits or the protection of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.802" offset="6190582">It's the consumer who can -- if he doesn't like it, control it with his fellow voters through the elective franchise and it's there that competition is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.192" offset="6232168">And we have used taxes and sales taxes both paid by the consumer balancing in the state of the consumer so that the -- the out-of-state vendor has no advantage over the instate vendor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.821" offset="6286608">That is fine for consumer taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.017" offset="6295489">But this tax, like other taxes on the vendor, should be paid to the vendor's state, and that is where the vendor operates, these taxes on the vendor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.132" offset="6335927">And the statute specifically forbids it's being passed on as such to customers within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.143" offset="6363930">It is passed on instead as part of the cost, just like any other cost that goes into the computation of general prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.789" offset="6394546">The result is, it's paid by customers in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.084" offset="6407711">It has no effect on local competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.803" offset="6418578">The contrast to this, well the property tax which my friend mentioned in the State's brief, of course, these automobiles to the extent, they're manufactured in Michigan, come out of factories in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.746" offset="6462360">Property taxes are paid on those factories to Michigan localities and those taxes are included in the cost which the Washington customer pays when he buys his car, but that's as it should be because the factories in -- on which the taxes are paid are contributing to the Washington customer's car and so are the services provided by the State of Michigan in support to those factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.949" offset="6547205">That's entirely different from a tax which is related merely to the fact that there's a customer in Washington which is required to be passed onto a customer in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.942" offset="6583150">The constitutional rules involved here are four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.911" offset="6603003">First, States may not tax the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.557" offset="6625573">Second, States may not discriminate against interstate commerce nor expose it to multiple burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.048" offset="6651591">Third, States may not tax subjects not within their territory, and fourth, States may not impose taxes bearing no reasonable relation -- relation to services and protection afforded by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.210" offset="6708224">Now, this tax as applied through these assessments is on the privilege of engaging in exclusively interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.144" offset="6735914">The Supreme Court of Washington said, “Though the tax is on local activities, these district managers running around in the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.910" offset="6767052">But such activities were solely in furtherance of sales which themselves were made as that Supreme Court recognized entirely outside of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.415" offset="6809057">They were not any part of nor were they in any way related to in the intrastate business and they were not related to any local office as the trial court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.741" offset="6850330">Now, the statute says that the tax is on the act or privilege of engaging in the business of making wholesale sales, engaging within the State, the business of making wholesale sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.016" offset="6891395">Because it's where they use the statutory version or the judicial version, it seems to me to make no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.554" offset="9501550">He said, “It's beyond dispute that a State may not lay a tax on the privilege of engaging interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.726" offset="9550242">For a reasons which I've just mentioned in response to questions on apportioned gross receipts tax, it's inherently discriminatory in that point also.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.091" offset="9579708">It was made by Mr. Justice Clark in Northwestern States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.476" offset="9593292">That is if it -- by its very nature, it tends to make interstate commerce bear more than its fair share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.044" offset="9619519">The reason for that is that it selects incidents and then it says, “Here's an incident on which we'll place a tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.428" offset="9645119">And that Washington of course can tax these little incidents, so can somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.189" offset="9660165">This incident of wholesale selling for example, which is supposed to be the basis of the tax here and you get these multiple burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.985" offset="9687333">That was the reasons that this very tax as the same one, was held invalid by this Court in Gwin, White &amp; Prince and the exposition of that point is best made and there was somewhat later case of Nippert against Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.819" offset="9746683">Interstate commerce may of course become involved in the measure of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.113" offset="9763819">If it gets itself so mixed up with intrastate commerce, that there isn't any reasonable way of separating it too and that's where the Norton Company got into trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.158" offset="9804048">And this Court refused to upset the judgments, substitute its own judgment for that of the Supreme Court of Illinois when it held that Norton had to pay so much -- a tax so much somewhere to the this with respect to transactions which were interstate in character but which passed through and admittedly, intrastate local store operating within the business -- within the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2488.991" offset="10059316">And to simplify it, let's assume if they sold abrasives in this local store, they sold the machinery merely by shipping from their factory in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.906" offset="10099022">Now, the -- the orders for the machinery which were passed through or deliveries which passed through the local store because they went along with this abrasive business were held to be so mixed up with the intrastate that you couldn't separate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.812" offset="10162657">Now, if you say that we're in anyway engaged in intrastate business here, as the operation of these dealerships, you have made us retailers and destroyed our wholesaling function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.582" offset="10205706">In that case, there's no tax due at all because the only operation is retail and the tax amount has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.467" offset="10229217">This is a second stage that's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.956" offset="10239248">The State all along has walked a tight rope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.252" offset="10248338">They wanted to make the dealer sort of part of General Motors, yet they've been awfully careful not to say they're an agent because if they ever said they're an agent, their whole case would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.528" offset="10281462">If they -- if we sold these cars on consignment, and the dealer merely as our agent passed title to the retail customer, there would be no wholesale transaction and hence none to this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.042" offset="10327542">The retail tax as I say is -- has been paid by the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.933" offset="10359097">Now, discriminatory structure of the Washington tax is our second problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.073" offset="10379682">The tax supplies, by its terms to manufacturing, if the product was manufactured within Washington, if the product is sold outside of Washington, but only if it's sold outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.915" offset="10427016">It applies to wholesaling if the product is sold within the State no matter where it's manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.214" offset="10452198">But it does not apply to manufacturing if the product is sold within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.799" offset="10478529">Now, our former statute -- former version of the same statute was held unconstitutional by the Washington Court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.587" offset="10505697">That version exempted from tax, from the tax under selling activity, receipts which had been subjected to the tax on the manufacturing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.884" offset="10550941">The Court -- the Legislature then promptly reversed the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.753" offset="10574346">And the Washington Court now holds it constitutional on the theory that everyone pays only one tax on the wholesaling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.224" offset="10600260">But it seems logical and reasonable if the original scheme was unconstitutional, mere in version of the statute to produce the same result, is not going to cure it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.619" offset="10637876">The Washington Court looks at only one section of the tax in the tax law, and the proper test is the entire scheme of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.957" offset="10671208">We neglected to mention this in our brief but we did cite the case of Henneford against Silas Mason on another point and that's exactly what was involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.558" offset="10705586">That was one of the early cases in which the constitutionality of the use tax was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.558" offset="10729618">And this Court held that although the use tax standing alone was obviously invalid because it applied only to products which were brought into the State having been purchased outside, and never to -- our products purchased within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.611" offset="10789804">“If the whole thing was nevertheless constitutional because the use tax balanced the sales tax and equality was the theme,” said the Court, “of the entire scheme of -- of taxation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.025" offset="10843512">In Halliburton against Reilly, which is the latest case on this subject to come before this Court last -- last term, “A use tax which otherwise would have been valid was held invalid in part because it applied to certain transactions or bore more heavily on certain transactions, then would the corresponding sales tax had the transaction been entirely within the State of Louisiana."</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.206" offset="10944240">And here, we have the same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.789" offset="10950510">If other states have the same taxing scheme that Washington has, interstate commerce will always pay twice and intrastate will always pay only once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.480" offset="10993246">Now, the City of St. Louis does have the same scheme and General Motors has a factory in St.Louis, and cars manufactured there, a few of them are sold in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.458" offset="11029191">The taxes are paid twice on those transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.866" offset="11042879">Once to the City of St. Louis for the privilege of manufacturing in St. Louis and once to the State of Washington if this assessment is upheld for the privilege of selling them to customers located in Washington.</text>
