            <text syncTime="8.420" offset="137070">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.266" offset="152430">I'd like to begin my argument by making clear one point that is crucial to our case and then I'm afraid I left very obscure yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.108" offset="191822">We are not claiming that the veteran has any rights in a higher position until after he has fully completed any work requirement that the employer imposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.953" offset="251173">He must actually work the number of days the employer requires before he has any rights in a higher position.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.345" offset="284714">Now, to take an example that will make that absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.924" offset="307075">If the employer -- if the employee has worked 100 days before he goes into military service and then misses, let's say 600 days of a 1040-day period, because of his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.819" offset="378650">When he returns, he must work 940 more days.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.037" offset="399548">He must get in 1040 days of actual work.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.414" offset="421073">This -- this case, the Brooks case, and the Tilton case which was the last one, only arise after he's actually completed 1040 days of actual work.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.488" offset="469347">At that point, he says, “I'd like my seniority date to be placed so I haven't lost my relative seniority position.”</text>
            <text syncTime="100.599" offset="505814">And that's where these cases begin after 1040 days of actual work.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.605" offset="817821">Now, we -- I had argued yesterday that the function of the statute, or the most important function is to grant the veteran as a matter of statutory right, what would've been his as a matter of contract right, had he been “continuously employed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="198.237" offset="896293">Those words have been used all the way back to fiscal decision at the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.305" offset="920639">I then argued that the quotes were taken from around the words “continuously employed” in a Diehl for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.832" offset="954702">The issue what “continuously employed” meant was squarely faced and decided and it was held that it means continuously at work when -- when the veteran would've had a right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.992" offset="1003290">That was the only case that has taken the quotes away from the words “continuously employed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="231.651" offset="1029935">And I finally said that in the McKinney case, the McKinney case was a case that again could be decided with the quotes around continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.111" offset="1063790">It said the veteran can only claim what would be his as a matter of right, had he been continuously employed when he was in military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.669" offset="1098062">He cannot claim what would've been his only in the employer's discretion, had he not been in military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.543" offset="1133589">But only one case has passed on exactly what “continuously employed” means and that's the Diehl case and that's never been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.006" offset="1179355">I had begun to discuss Brooks yesterday, Brooks was an apprentice in contrast to Diehl who was an upgraded helper.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.241" offset="1208299">And I'd said that the requirement of finishing 1040 days of apprenticeship was, we believed, identical to the requirement of working 1040 days as an upgraded helper in Diehl, I'd also talked about the requirement of a correspondence course.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.927" offset="1279039">There are two other things I should mention in Brook -- Brooks, two other points that I do not think are difficulties but they are points.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.230" offset="1316342">The first is, the respondent suggests that the fact that Brooks transferred a number of times after returning to Monroe, Louisiana, maybe relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.327" offset="1368691">One of those transfers was apparently a discretionary transfer with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.756" offset="1390425">My answer to that is very much what I answered Justice Stewart before.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.620" offset="1409860">“We're only reconstructing his time of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.590" offset="1429713">He left Monroe, Louisiana and he returned to Monroe, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.593" offset="1445700">He claims the right to be treated during that gap in his employment career as if he had been continuously employed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="344.106" offset="1479764">There are no transfers as to the rest of his career after his return, he takes that as it falls, that's his actual history of -- he gets lot of days of work, that's fine if doesn't, that's fine too.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.930" offset="1527097">When Brooks returned to Monroe, Louisiana after his military service, he had certain statutory rights because there would've been contract rights had he been continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.265" offset="1568475">One of those was a right to be treated as if he had worked whenever he would've had the right to work, had he not been in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.770" offset="1606405">He -- he carried this with him wherever he went later.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.589" offset="1621765">And later when he actually completed 1040 days of actual work, he could count these days in setting his seniority date.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.546" offset="1657605">Later transfers just aren't relevant in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.110" offset="1675786">The final variation in the case is --</text>

            <text syncTime="410.122" offset="1743809">It would -- it -- yes, they're certainly relevant in the sense that he has to actually work and that the days of actual work are counted up and had he -- had he failed to get work after he returned from Monroe, Louisiana, could he -- and had he not been able to find work as an apprentice, that would've slowed him down very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.916" offset="1835029">The last -- their variation is the one the Eighth Circuit decided on.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.105" offset="1851747">The Eighth Circuit said in its decision in this case that Brooks had no right to be employed as a journeyman in North Little Rock on November 3rd, 1955, the date everyone has agreed for purposes of this case or for purposes of dating that he would've finished his apprenticeship.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.998" offset="1947355">They say moreover, it was certainly unforeseeable that there would've been a shortage of a -- of journeymen machinist at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.211" offset="1988211">I'm -- I'm sorry, I have to take the Court back.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.591" offset="1997720">I had said yesterday that seniority as a journeyman begins on the first date that an apprentice works as a journeyman after completing his apprenticeship period.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.354" offset="2044740">It doesn't begin on the last date of completing the apprenticeship period but on the first day of work as a journeyman.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.603" offset="2073788">Well, to the Eighth Circuit's decision, we say that Brooks had the very sort of right to work as a journeyman on November 3rd, 1955 but the statute gives him a statute that the statute protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.447" offset="2145155">He had a right to be employed ahead of all those who were actually doing journeyman work on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.504" offset="2177337">Not all of those, all those upgraded apprentices.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.029" offset="2191444">The record is clear that there were number of vacancies for a journeyman's work on November 3rd, in November, 1955, that these were being filled by upgraded apprentices and that any journeyman would've had a right to bump all -- what of -- well, the first or anyone of the upgraded apprentices and take that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.815" offset="2286634">All the statute requires in the way of a right to a promotion or a right to a seniority date or a right to work, is a right to fill a vacancy ahead of all the other claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.802" offset="2342536">That's -- that's the holding of the Mckin -- of McKinney on remand, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.845" offset="2366777">The Court remanded McKinney to determine whether McKinney would've had a right ahead of all other claimants to a -- a vacancy in group 1, he had been in group 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.185" offset="2412126">And the -- the only right that the Court required was a right ahead of all other claimants to fill a vacancy that in fact, existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.714" offset="2446190">Brooks had a right ahead of a number of claimants to fill a vacancy that actually existed at the time he would've completed his apprenticeship, he had a right to work as a journeyman at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.438" offset="2493106">It's -- as a practical matter, it's hardly necessary to add that he -- as a practical matter, he had a right against his employer too.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.526" offset="2529468">His employer could only have failed to hire him as a journeyman by discharging a number of upgraded apprentices and seen a great deal of -- of machinist work left undone.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.578" offset="2597700">The other fork of the Eighth Circuit's decision was that even if this maybe so, the fact that vacancies would exist on November 3rd was certainly unforeseeable when he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.369" offset="2648900">This is the heart of the Brooks decision and the foreseeability is very much part of the decision in Tilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.297" offset="2676590">We believe that foreseeability is plainly not required under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.186" offset="2700100">This again was decided in the McKinney remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.500" offset="2717341">When McKinney left for service, he couldn't have known that there would be a vacancy in group 1 during his absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.975" offset="2751300">The Court held that if he had a right to be the one to fill that vacancy, he was entitled to, on his return, to be given that vacancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.701" offset="2798216">Now, that was unforeseeable but the Court squarely held that he had that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.998" offset="2819323">Foreseeability simply doesn't -- isn't simply -- isn't a requirement for the veteran to assert his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.384" offset="2852864">Now, in conclusion, I'd like to say just about three or four sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.745" offset="2890376">I've argued this case very largely in terms of it having been decided in Diehl that a veteran should be treated as if he were continuously at work, and this decision not having been later reversed by the Court in McKinney, McKinney involving a quite different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.399" offset="2964982">I'd like to say in conclusion that even if Diehl were not there, the Diehl result seems to me, to be almost dictated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.796" offset="3006568">The statute directs the employer in the courts to return the veteran without loss of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.179" offset="3040110">The veterans in a case like this where they haven't been able to complete a number of days work requirement, 1040 days in both this cases and in Tilton, have sustained a very substantial loss of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.566" offset="3097684">There is no question but the best approximation of maintaining their seniority position is to treat them as if they had been at work whenever they had a right to work and not to treat them as if they had been on a leave of absence, which is one thing they wouldn't have been on.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.560" offset="3165602">Against that best approximation, the only fact -- there are no factors as there were in McKinney that weigh against adopting that best approximation.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.226" offset="3208234">There is no interference with the employer's discretion which were in the Court in McKinney.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.321" offset="5968645">The Government emphasizes in its brief that Brooks had a contract right to complete his apprenticeship once he had gotten into it and once he got over the first 130 days which was more or less a probationary or trial period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.656" offset="6029981">I'd like to point out that that is not what it -- it might imply, his contract right to complete the apprenticeship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.983" offset="6055267">He was not employed for a term of days or months adding up to 1040 year -- 1040 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.994" offset="6087346">He was employed to complete his apprenticeship specifically provided in the agreement that he could be discharged for cause during the entirety of the 1040 days and certainly, he was subject to layoffs, which an employee contracted to work for a -- a period of time would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.135" offset="6183894">This is best evidence by what happened to Mr. Brooks in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.551" offset="6201553">He came back from the middle of his service to Monroe and resumed his apprenticeship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.615" offset="6217853">And thereafter, the -- there was a change and the work done at Monroe and he was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.408" offset="6245021">The machinist work was no longer available to him as an apprentice there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.439" offset="6261112">So he had no right to continue his employment as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.761" offset="6274382">Now, he was able to some several months later, to find a vacancy in the St. Louis shops of the Railroad Company and transferred there in response to a system call.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.022" offset="6311476">But his so-called right to complete the employmentship -- to -- the employment to the extent that it is relevant isn't really what it implies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.766" offset="6350451">That is, that he was employed subject to the layoff if -- if the work diminished and subject to a discharge for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.763" offset="6390471">There is a stipulation in this case that I want to discuss to a certain extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.857" offset="6418787">November 3, 1955 was the date that Mr. Heymann has referred to that all parties agreed that -- and to use his expression “that he would have completed his apprenticeship but for the military interruption.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.927" offset="6475107">What that was, that was not intended as a stipulation to make this ideal type of case that is an agreement that the 1040 days were simply a work period and was not a training period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.151" offset="6524008">It was not intended to -- to take it out of the -- or to resolve the uncertainties, a non-automatic type of -- of criteria that was laid down in McKinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.985" offset="6571342">In 1945, the Railroad Company and the Railroad Brotherhood entered into an agreement which is referred to in this record as the Memorandum of Understanding of 1945, which provided the apprentices more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.409" offset="6625050">The apprentices, who had been employed by the Railroad Company and then went to service during the course of their apprenticeship, went to the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.174" offset="6656084">It provided them more than the Act provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.658" offset="6666010">It provided that upon return and completion of their apprenticeship with the Railroad Company after the military service, their seniority as journeymen would be fixed as of the date they would have completed their apprenticeship but for the military interruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.906" offset="6731003">Now, having made that provision and having apprentices now returning in the 1940s from the military service and completing their apprenticeship, it was necessary for these contracting parties, the Railroad Company and the Brotherhood to device a method of computation under that contract by which they would assign those seniority dates to these apprentices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.142" offset="6823894">And it is that method of computation by which the November 3, 1955 date is reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.058" offset="6855555">That is we -- we do not agree by saying that he would have finished on November 3, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.542" offset="6885543">That all of these uncertainties that may have kept him from finishing are resolved, are no longer in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.423" offset="6913024">All we say and it's quite clear in the parts of the record that I've quoted in the brief that operating under the Memorandum of Understanding on 1945 and computing the time as all such computations have been made, the date of November 3, 1955 is developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.835" offset="6990764">In fact, the Railroad Company contends and concedes that in this case, he's entitled to that date retroactive seniority at Monroe, Louisiana under the agreement, without reference to any right he acquires under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.209" offset="7044159">He doesn't want the seniority at Monroe and has rejected it because it's of little practical value to have seniority there where the work is not done or there's insufficient work done for him to be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.696" offset="7098180">The -- the Court of Appeals made reference to that stipulation and -- and concurred in what I've just said that it was clearly made with the reservation that it was a method of computation, not a stipulation that he would have in fact, finished on that date had he not had to go to the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.672" offset="7194102">I find no difficulty with either McKinney or Diehl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.445" offset="7209148">In this case, the McKinney rule is that the Act reserves for the returning veteran what he automatically, as a matter of right and that Mr. Heymann says that it certainly must be contact right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.078" offset="7255646">I don't know where else he would acquire such right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.057" offset="7267558">It preserves those things he automatically, as a matter of right would've acquired had he remained out of the military service and in the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.654" offset="7306010">Diehl involved in an allegation in the complaint by the veteran that he would have in fact finished the apprenticeship on such and such a date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.159" offset="7351986">And the case being decided on motion in the lower court, that must be taken as admitted which we don't have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.862" offset="7386781">The Government argues, I think, that this Court should overrule McKinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.655" offset="7413948">At page 36 of the Government's brief, it argues that what it is advocating for a veteran, is that he'd be able to have under the Act, all of those benefits proved with that degree of certainty, normally requisite to the established legal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.783" offset="7494510">That he probably would've gotten had he remained in the employment instead to go in the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.475" offset="7521259">I do not know what the reference or the phrase with that degree of certainty -- showed with that degree certainty, normally requisite to establish legal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.070" offset="7563682">I don't know what that could mean other than preponderance of the evidence which is the usual standard by which legal rights are established on a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.960" offset="7603179">Now in McKinney, this Court rejected the proposition that a veteran was entitled under the Act to those things that it's highly probable that he would have acquired had he stayed in the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.817" offset="7662634">It specifically rejected that and adopted the automatic -- as a matter of contact right standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.725" offset="7690324">If the Court concurred in the Government's approach in this case, it would not only go back to approving the highly probable standard but it would be down to a point of a preponderance of the probabilities because that's all the preponderance of the evidence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.379" offset="7760854">The Government is really asking the Court to go much further back than even the McKinney case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.555" offset="7805576">I think that the position taken by the Railroad Brotherhood in their amicus brief is deserving of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.016" offset="7839431">They point out that this law has been a fertile breeding ground for litigation from the time of its original enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.692" offset="7870151">And that the Diehl case didn't resolve that but perhaps prompted additional litigation, has been a great deal since Diehl, since this Court did dispose of Diehl without an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.357" offset="7928769">But with the standards laid down in McKinney and they're clear standards, they're standards that the Courts of Appeals have had no difficulty with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.393" offset="7960952">I think that Courts of Appeal are not in conflict as to the application of the McKinney standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.268" offset="7988433">That will resolve the litigation that we've had so long for 20 years which is expensive as pointed out by the Brotherhood and which engenders unhappiness in the entire industry and all the industries affected by this, by constant litigation among fellow workers seeking to obtain relative benefits to the relative detriment of their fellow workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.693" offset="8110164">The transfer feature which is novel in this case, arises from the fact that the veteran employee seeks assignment of a seniority day, a retroactive seniority day, had a place other than that at which the collective bargaining agreement would assign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.814" offset="8202637">The railroad industry has traditionally had a system of point seniority that is an apprentice or a journeyman at Monroe, Louisiana shops, has no seniority at North Little Rock shops for the same Railroad Company or the St. Louis shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.234" offset="8268257">And if he transfers from Monroe as a journeyman, to North Little Rock, he goes to the bottom of the journeyman seniority roster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.667" offset="8306082">That permits -- it obvious purposes to permit, the men on a seniority roster to be able to look at it and know where they stand down, where they will continue to stand with reference to the people ahead of them on the seniority roster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.324" offset="8360626">And doesn't permit men from other shops or other points on the Railroad Company to come in and get ahead of them on a seniority roster to the point that they maybe affected by a layoff where they otherwise would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.873" offset="8406915">That's the traditional, basic concept in -- with these threats and seniority with railroad companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.560" offset="8453622">Now, in this case, Mr. Brooks was entitled under the collective bargaining agreement to retroactive seniority at Monroe but in fact, he seeks it in North Little Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.482" offset="8505344">Now, there's only one Court of Appeals case that has come to grips with the problem of where the rights arising out of transfer, benefits accruing from transfer are subject to the McKinney standard in the same sense that benefits arising out of promotion are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.341" offset="8580786">That is whether it must be automatic and as a matter of contract right, that's the Horton case from the Fifth Circuit and they clearly said that there's no distinction that -- that transfer and promotion, benefits arising from those things are subject to the McKinney standard and certainly, I can find no logical reason why that shouldn't be a applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.206" offset="8668244">The District Court concluded that the significant factor was not -- that he had no contract right to be at North Little Rock -- to transfer at North Little Rock and thereby seek his retroactive seniority there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.028" offset="8723519">He had none and no contract right, the District Court said the significant thing was that he did do it, he did do it in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.538" offset="8757478">It's clear he -- he was in St. Louis, he requested the transfer of his master mechanic in St. Louis who gave his approval and then he requested the transfer of the master mechanic at North Little Rock where he was seeking to go, who gave his approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.736" offset="8818291">There's no doubt that that was a result of exercise managerial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.422" offset="8837099">In the District Court's conclusion that the significant factor was that he did transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.499" offset="8853400">And not where they had a right to do it, is contrary to this Court's holding in McKinney which was specifically that a gratuitous benefit conferred by management.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.460" offset="8893210">The one required does not thereby enlarge the veteran's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.356" offset="8912750">In McKinney, the man had been assigned to the group 1 position on return, it appeared that he did not -- that -- that he -- that the company wasn't required to put him in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.641" offset="8957889">The company contended they put him in it through a mistake of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.693" offset="8974190">And this Court says, they're making a difference whether the mistake of law or not, it was a gratuitous benefit to which he wouldn't entitle as a matter of right and didn't enlarge his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.118" offset="9043884">I think to have the case in the proper perspective, appropriate to again, referred to the remarks I've made in response to the Chief Justice's question about the Railroad Company's direct interest and it's liability to direct injuries that result to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.130" offset="9119848">I think that the Railroad Company's probable injury would not be great and then certainly, it somewhat remote at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.190" offset="9160182">They're probably doing here is dealing with -- of course they're not seeking some absolute benefit against the Railroad Company such as it seems on an hour increase in pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.335" offset="9196753">We're dealing with employees, co-employees seeking benefits relative to their fellow employees and which they can have and enjoy only at the detriment of their fellow employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.721" offset="9246281">Now, these fellow employees who aren't veterans have earned seniority.</text>
