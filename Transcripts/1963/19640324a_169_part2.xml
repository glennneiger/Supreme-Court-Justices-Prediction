            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">I have just a few remarks if I may and I'd like to say this to Mr. Justice Stewart, the question about Title 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.983" offset="183254">But I should have in answer to your question about its construction indicated to you that the Supreme Court of -- of Alabama has already construed the statute in the way that we suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.019" offset="231424">This is in (Inaudible) versus Cleveland Motor Company case which it has given the construction of the statute that is merely a genuine -- at least genuine service of process statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.812" offset="274578">The motion for rehearing which is set out on page 213 as all of the assignment of errors really or assignments of errors are in fact the restatement of the -- all the allegations which have set -- set or which have been set out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.154" offset="348035">And the question to Mr. Justice Black asked about the application of the rules as to whether they were discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.320" offset="384606">We have set out in -- in our main brief at page 29, a list of cases which we think will support our -- our contention that there has been a departure from these rules and that the Supreme Court of Alabama does indicate that that the rules have not been complied with -- that they will go through the merits anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.636" offset="465899">One point I'll finally -- the record of -- the entire record is in the -- is in the clerk's office and that insofar as the Attorney General's office is concerned that in our brief, we argue, our brief was devoted almost entirely to the merits of this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.038" offset="543535">We filed our brief here first and we would want to point out to the Court that if there was concern in the Attorney General about meeting the argument on -- on the merits, that they had the opportunity at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.546" offset="869543">We made and put them in a form of assignments of error and presented them to the -- to the court of -- to the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.427" offset="905070">The -- now, I would say that all of them -- but certainly, where the Court indicates that the assignment that we have made about the sufficiency of the weight of the evidence which is the questions that you were addressing to Mr. Madison and indicates that these are without merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.541" offset="989497">I think that we would be in a position to argue that those have to be here because merit must mean merit.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.593" offset="1061700">It's true that the -- that the -- the assignment didn't say the sufficiency of the evidence that -- and the Supreme Court perhaps passed on the merits of that -- that point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="357.955" offset="1535143">Well, I -- I would think in my own open argument in regard to it is that -- is that as a matter of -- of fact, I would think that all of the assignments would be here even assuming that the -- that the decree is -- that the rule of -- of Alabama is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.017" offset="1627408">Because as a -- because as a matter of fact, we did discuss in our -- in our brief on the merit, each and every one of the assignments except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.293" offset="1680593">The Supreme Court of -- of Alabama has said because you have argued this -- you have argued one together -- ones without the merit and therefore, we won't -- we won't consider any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.973" offset="1739316">But I suppose what I'm really doing is, I'm going now to attack the rule which is not really the question that you asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.574" offset="1769618">The problem of course that we have with this is that apparently, we raised 23 assignments of errors and as we made 23 points, the Supreme Court of Alabama would've held that we were within the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.044" offset="1815594">We thought that we were giving assistance and help to the Court by arguing the -- the cases as we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.458" offset="1853210">I would say also that if the questions that were raised to Mr. Madison indicate the difficulties, Madison is the Assistant Attorney General of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.505" offset="1901380">The difficulty of interpreting the rules of the Alabama court and, although Alabama has said the rules are not traps.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.006" offset="1935444">Mr. Madison seems to have difficulty in telling the Court how the rules are applied or even what the rules are.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.095" offset="1963760">And I would suggest to the Court that if the Attorney General seems to have that difficulty then certainly an ordinary practitioner would also.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.197" offset="1996152">And finally, the cash bond issue which was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.936" offset="2015065">I want to say that on this cash bond, that in the argument before the Supreme Court of Alabama and I think I'm quoting Mr. Madison correctly “indicated to the Supreme Court of Alabama that this was a question but it was not being pressed by him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="495.174" offset="2084028">Now, the Supreme Court of Alabama knew this and yet passed upon -- dismissed the case or dispose of it on the grounds that are now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.417" offset="2124988">On the ordinary rules and procedure, I would assume that having had it before -- before it that the Court has therefore disposed of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.918" offset="2159052">But by Mr. Madison raising this point in this Court at this time, seeking to preserve it and reinject it into the case, it's -- I think it -- it is clear that the difficulty in the preca -- precarious procedural difficulty in which petitioner would find itself is -- unless this Court finally settles this cause.</text>
