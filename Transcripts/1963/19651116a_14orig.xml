            <label>Mr. John L. Madden</label>
            <text syncTime="60.855" offset="243357">Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.680" offset="274704">A first few words that I shall say will -- I will -- ameliorating to this Court, because I said substantially the same thing I gave before standing before this Court when I had the privilege of doing so I introduced the argument in this manner, my recollection of how we came into this Court and why.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.488" offset="377940">And we have a new justice on the Supreme Court in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.144" offset="400509">And I'll just simply say that this controversy had its inception in a suit that was filed by certain Mississippi landowners and a District Court of the United States in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.735" offset="474906">It was directed solely against Humble Oil and Refining Company, Louisiana's mineral lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.214" offset="516807">The Mississippi landowners alleged in their complaint, as they were the owners of an oil well which was drilled by Carter Oil Company which merged with Humble Oil on December the 1st, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.589" offset="586292">Under its lease from the drill site in Louisiana to an oil producing zone and bottomed in the bed of the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.271" offset="629029">Plaintiffs, Mr. Carrols and Carrols (ph) family claimed that the oil well was producing within the State of Mississippi from lands which they had come to own by a reason now were shift in the main channel of the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.222" offset="708859">The title to Louisiana's property having been attacked in that suit, Louisiana filed a motion, this Honorable Court believed to file a complaint and all that the court did before this Court, the only tribunal that could pass on all of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.885" offset="807497">And we made as defendants, the State of Mississippi, the Mississippi landowners now lessees on them giving everyone the right to come in and be heard subject to granting the pleading granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.774" offset="891089">The United States district judge issued an order staying the proceedings in the Federal District Court with all of the necessary parties both public and private being before this Court after leave was granted to file a complaint, this Court in our -- in its order that we interpreted it, accept the jurisdiction for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.383" offset="1021492">The Special Master then conducted hearings, took evidence and heard all authorities, both private and public wishing to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.446" offset="1077708">He has filed his report and we are here on exceptions to that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.548" offset="1106129">It is my purpose to state the facts in this original action, particularly all of the controlling facts on which Louisiana predicates its exceptions to the Special Master report, the effects in this case dominate because they are unprecedented in boundary actions heretofore decided by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.098" offset="1228382">My Associate Counsel, Mr. Carmouche shall follow me to discuss the existing jurisprudence and the legal phases of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.341" offset="1273313">It is appropriate to say at the start that Louisiana concurs fully in all of the truly important parts of the Special Master's findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.145" offset="1344575">In his illuminating résumé of facts highlighting his report, the Special Master lightens the Mississippi River to assert between Carlyle, Illinois and the Gulf of Mexico, referring of course to the continuous bends or loops near the river extending ultimately from east to west throughout the descent of the river and in widening its way to the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.061" offset="1488144">The expert witnesses at the hearings conducted by the Special Master, agreed that the deepest part of the river by the channel is in the concave portion of the -- where the force of the river strikes hard against the bank causing erosion and caving.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.635" offset="1586469">While across the river, in the convex area, where the water is shallow accretion is formed to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.262" offset="1641012">They explained that the river in the concave area crosses over to the next bend in the concave area and then again following its course downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.918" offset="1707572">Now material from the concave bank is deposited on the next convex bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.183" offset="1752712">Caving is the result of the direction of a channel against the concave bank where the deepest portion of the river is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.414" offset="1797642">Scouring may take place in the deeper portion of the river where there are high velocities.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.383" offset="1833482">If the banks are composed of homogenous material, the expert say that bends are rather uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.974" offset="1867860">However, resistant material such as clay or clay deposits when encountered by river action form a bank called a false keep or hard point.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.975" offset="1923866">And where there are such tough or resistant soil have been developed slowly and is partly controlled in configuration by that soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.446" offset="1969737">Clay pugs are characterized as cohesive hanging together forming a resistant mass to any channel obscuring action of the river, and are quite thick.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.189" offset="2024699">The experts reported crossings in the river as extending to relatively straight regions.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.476" offset="2077884">They are located almost invariably up and downstream on the -- in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.310" offset="2125218">And in those places where the navigator goes from one deep area to another and in that is a crossing and in that crossing the water is much shallower than it is in the deeper portion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="547.381" stopTime="553.858">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="547.381" offset="2189479">We'll recess now Mr.--</text>

          <turn speaker="john_l_madden" startTime="553.858" stopTime="848.758">
            <label>Mr. John L. Madden</label>
            <text syncTime="553.858" offset="2215393">-- made reference to crossings to the area where the navigator goes from one deep water area that follows a bend over to the next concave bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.806" offset="2259174">And in this crossing area, we have brought out that that the water is generally shallow in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.485" offset="2289894">Now the only purpose of that is to show the Court the difference between your conclave and your convex bank and then you cross from one area to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.582" offset="2334302">Now in that crossing, of course the water is shallow.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.968" offset="2347781">You're not following the deepest water because the deepest water is where you're trying to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.028" offset="2376098">Now proceeding from that point, I would like to say that throughout the expert testimony, exceeding stress was placed on the high importance of clay deposits found in the banks of meandering streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.599" offset="2458331">The experts explained this tough material not only slows down the formation and development of bends, it has in affect on the configuration, it may elongate -- negate it, they won't be uniform bends.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.137" offset="2548506">At the -- then it also appreciatively affects the control of the direction of the channel flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.608" offset="2594377">It is of exceeding importance, may it please the Court it will bear this clay plug as resistant soil in mine as I further reveal the facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.106" offset="2644323">And we are going to cling as close as we can to the language of the Special Master in this matter and that's why -- course of the remaining portion of my part of the argument shall be in quotation from that because I want to link it in with the certain conclusions we reach to the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.887" offset="2719451">On pages 6 and 7, there is a report, the Special Master says that, “At flood time, this bends, those meandering loops, grow even larger by the accelerated river action.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.650" offset="2802521">Increase the overall length of the river where the corresponding decrease in the speed of the flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.772" offset="2843063">And the greatest slope can be obtained by a cutoff across the neck thus increasing the rapidity of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.235" offset="2888934">The slowing down of the flow is a direct cause of flooding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="728.811" offset="2915161">“And so attempts,” the Special Master says, "Have been made to alleviate this by constructing cutoff or bypass bends."</text>
            <text syncTime="740.522" offset="2962077">The Special Master requires of course to the action taken by the Mississippi River Commission under the guidance and the engineer in experience of the United State Corps of Engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.042" offset="3012127">In 19 -- in the late 1920s and the early 19 -- other in the 1930s, in their effort to improve flood control and navigation on the Mississippi River by the constructions of these cutoffs, that plan called for the construction of 15 cutoffs and those cutoffs have been constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.901" offset="3111602">Between Memphis, Tennessee and about 20 miles south of Natchez, Mississippi in what is referred to as the Deer Park area.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.758" offset="3158936">This is getting in a proximity here of the cut that we're speaking of and it includes this Glasscock Cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.126" offset="3192477">It was one of the areas, one of the longest.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.749" offset="3210971">Deer -- now, I'm going to ask to draw the Court's attention to the diagram that it appears here.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.029" offset="3244095">I regret, apologize to the Court that this is not larger in the larger lettering.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.681" offset="3274710">But we have a little bit hard to anticipate just to the division from the sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.599" offset="3302296">But we have a lettering on here and I don't know whether they can be seen from the bench or not, but here is a letter Y, it runs around to a letter H and then to J and to A, B, C, X, Z and on this side B to X.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.648" offset="3782531">Now, such -- you have this wide sweep and then it's kind of balanced downstream by the smallest sweep to the west toward Mississippi which is the Dead Mans Bend.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.117" offset="3840418">Now, those two bends have been moving in opposite directions since the first recorded surveys of this area in 1860 -- in 1765.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.576" offset="3898201">Now the United States Engineers decided to construct a 4-mile trench, running from the point of mark Y to point of B, that's a distance of approximately 4 miles and that is what is called Glasscock Cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.277" offset="3989107">Now -- and that bypass is generally referred to and it's correctly they describe as the Glasscock Cutoff which goes from Y to B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.823" offset="4047203">And this B is the intersection line here -- is the line -- is the point where the old bend of Deer Park bend comes through here, point A and then continues in the stretch of the thalweg prior to the cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.132" offset="4120451">It goes around and sweeps to the east and goes from point B to C and then C to X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.184" offset="4184712">Now, the vast changes that took place in connection with the cutoff weren't completely visible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.795" offset="4231105">The drag in by the engineers was clearly perceptible, so where with the tons and tons of material that was dredged out in deposits on the then existing banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.554" offset="4330162">You have a material flopping in this area, very acute slope, where there was a 160 acres that caved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.989" offset="4391915">Now throughout that cut, it is inescapable and it would've been inescapable to anyone watching it, the things that it progressed in that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.211" offset="4492748">Now on pages 46 and 47 of his report, the Special Master has this to say, "The original plan of the engineers was to excavate a narrow 4-mile pilot channel, across the neck and then to permit the natural scouring effects of the river to complete the cutoff by moving through the cut in ever increasing amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.655" offset="4626599">The pilot channel was dug in the early 1933 and had a slight curve in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.578" offset="4650214">So it can direct the flow into Dead Mans Bend on a course approximately south.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.348" offset="4681352">Still quoting from the report, "If the cutoff once developed by the river was to maintain its pre-planed course, it was essential that there be uniform caving on both banks of the cut."</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.056" offset="4864209">And thus it eroded a less resistant bank of the lower western side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.672" offset="4886674">Instead of the water coming around here and getting in this sweep than it -- the water started in this direction here hard against the Louisiana Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.694" offset="4942681">Still reporting from the Special Master, aside from this unexpected development in the construction of Glasscock Cutoff, it was also a considerable delay in its final completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.922" offset="4987611">This delay was caused mainly by the same clay deposit which continued to settle back into the cut act -- excavation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.210" offset="5032751">For this reason, the cutoff did not carry an annual average of more than 50% of the flow until about 1941, eight years after they commenced with the construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.706" offset="5714756">“The elimination of historical Dead Mans Bend has called an erosion into Louisiana in a -- an accretion of aluminum to Mississippi in the first three miles below cut.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.285" offset="5957068">Then there has also have been agreed by stipulating between the counsel that the previous main channel runs along the line B, X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.455" offset="6005760">Now, Special Master had no particular difficulty in reaching the vast majority of his findings but he had difficulty in certain combinations of course that were no river surveys from 1942 to 1951 and now from 1952 to 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.171" offset="6100637">It was particularly difficult for him to try to locate the position of the thalweg with relation to the well during certain years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.221" offset="6152882">Now, may it please the Court, I want to say it very briefly before I close that we have arrived at four major conclusions in connection with the facts that have been found with the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.900" offset="6223517">First, that where in an action of this kind the cutoff is constructed by the United States Engineers through the use of artificial means and the direction of the current has been changed so drastically as to eliminate an entire (Inaudible) bend after creating instead in reverse bend.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.586" offset="6478263">Now, if a certain minor changes have made where nature could do it alone, man could do it, then the states are expected to resign emissaries to this minor changes but when a man comes in and completely ignores the nature and does that which nature cannot do, then we think that states like Louisiana in an action of this kind has the right to question some of the old concepts of avulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.570" offset="7182211">The Special Master found as Mr. Madden pointed out in his open statement that the vested rights of the State of Louisiana are directly involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.034" offset="7228082">In addition, some of the property rights of its mineral lessee Humble Oil Refining Company also all the rights of certain Mississippi citizens as well as the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.683" offset="7282730">The Special Match -- Master advised this Court that you should take jurisdiction over the boundary question which should leave these ancillary issues to some other tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.541" offset="7330064">Needless to say the problems of taxation of the validity of leases of the administrative powers exercised by the state over the production and sale of petroleum products make all of these factors inextricably bound in with the boundary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.623" offset="7414491">I would like to point out that Louisiana does not wish to submit itself to any other tribunal insofar as these ancillary matters are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.617" offset="7462452">We think that this is the only court that has jurisdiction over all of the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.190" offset="7488679">Now, I am authorized to say on behalf of Humble and we in Louisiana recognize that Humble may have certain additional defenses to the State of Louisiana as well because they have leased this from citizens from Louisiana as well as the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.521" offset="7570077">Nevertheless, Humble joins with the State of Louisiana in its principle argument on the boundary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.995" offset="7603931">Now, there really three general rules of law which are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.075" offset="7628278">The first rule is that when a navigable river such as the Mississippi forms the boundary between two states that the thalweg or middle of the main channel is the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.083" offset="7684284">Second, the Master stated with accuracy on page 14, when by a natural, gradual and more or less imperceptible processes of erosion and accretion, the thalweg changes, the boundary follows the stream and remains along the varying center of the channel, citing New Orleans versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.683" offset="7778638">Equally well established in our law is the proposition of avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.005" offset="7808000">When an avulsion occurs, the center of the old channel remains the boundary, County of St. Clair versus Lovingston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.457" offset="7845825">Now in the context of these general rules of law and the facts in the record, the position of the State of Louisiana may be stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.199" offset="7884696">First, the changes which took place here are avulsive in nature, are avulsive in effect and therefore in and of themselves are sufficient to cause the boundary to be fixed permanently as it was prior to the work of the U.S. Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.390" offset="7969541">Second, the changes here were wholly caused, all witnesses testified this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.761" offset="7999007">Were wholly caused by artificial means, the artificial means here used were so extensive and the changes resulting there from were so drastic that this Court is required to rule that the boundary has been fixed permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.816" offset="8067239">Now, we will show that the changes are avulsive in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.833" offset="8083331">There're various definitions of avulsion and no one definition is consistently used by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.468" offset="8113842">Perhaps the best definition is contained in 56 American Jurisprudence Section 477.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.554" offset="8142158">Avulsion is a sudden and perceptible loss or addition to land by the action of water or a sudden change in the bed or course of a stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.273" offset="8209032">All of the cases show that there are actually to types of avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.098" offset="8228362">One type is where there is a sudden and perha -- perceptible gain or loss of land on the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.030" offset="8260023">The opposite of this type of avulsion is the gradual and imperceptible process of accretion and erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.801" offset="8291161">It is in that kind of avulsion which deals only with banks that the element of time and perceptibility become important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.606" offset="8334420">The other type of avulsion has nothing to do with the banks of streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.127" offset="8356467">This is avulsion in which there is a sudden change in the bed or course of a stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.515" offset="8393979">This type of avulsion is not the opposite of accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.123" offset="8408398">We do not have here a change in the bed of the river in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.462" offset="8429819">But what we do have is a definite and drastic change in the course of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.577" offset="8458240">In this case, we found that Dead Mans Bend which had previously flowed hard towards the Mississippi bank has been wrenched by the U.S. Engineers and now flows hard against Louisiana's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.992" offset="8523964">This is a complete reversal of the forces of nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.048" offset="8552176">We are here concerned in this case, not with what has happened to the banks, has there been a build-up with the accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.571" offset="8586240">We are concerned here with the location of a thalweg which follows the main channel of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.086" offset="8616333">This is a line in the water and here, time and perceptibility are not necessary in order to contrast what occurred here with some other rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.334" offset="8673280">In many cases where the distinction was unimportant, it has even been stated that our second type of avulsion had to be perceptible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.399" offset="8713509">The cases indicate that the factor of imperceptibility has never stood in this Court's way in determining an avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.563" offset="8754155">If there was a drastic change in the bed or course of the stream, we know of no case where there was a drastic change in the thalweg in which this Court has ever held that the change was not rapid enough to be avulsive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.003" offset="8832000">The cases we have examined of this Court show that periods as short as one year or as long as 10 years had been sufficient to be held avulsive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.611" offset="8882364">In our own case, the engineers took eight years before the Glasscock Cutoff was even the principal channel of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.553" offset="8914129">It was 19 years before the avulsive works were completed in the cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.749" offset="8934922">Only in 1952 was the high water flow all through the cutoff, yet no one questions here even our friends from Mississippi, that what happened in this Court was avulsive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.130" offset="9012454">On the facts that we have here, there should be no doubt that the changes which occurred were sufficiently rapid viewed with respect to nick of time lapsing in past cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.562" offset="9066162">The change of course took place in the problem area quite dramatically after 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.382" offset="9097509">Now Mississippi's own contention was, which they vigorously urge show that the oil well which is set fully located in the problem area that the thalweg changed 1500 feet in less than 18 months whereas, it had changed only a thousand feet from its 1933 location in 18 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.567" offset="9210253">Mississippi in its argument would penalize us because the engineers to -- who undertook what at that time was a gigantic task and failed to maintain channel line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.669" offset="9266573">They would also penalize us because the engineers took a long time to accomplish their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.202" offset="9296771">We should not be so doubly penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.911" offset="9311608">We therefore may conclude that the changes here correspond to the basic concept of avulsion and to the fundamental reasoning inherent therein accordingly the same legal consequences falling from avulsion should be applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.132" offset="9384438">Now beyond the concept of avulsion, let us now consider violent changes which are caused wholly by the works of man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.141" offset="9428532">Can the works of man which completely reverse the processes of nature as on the facts of this case change the boundaries of states?</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.722" offset="9474821">Absolutely not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.997" offset="9483912">Of course there was a time not too many years ago when the power of man to so drastically affect boundaries simply did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.528" offset="9522051">There had been a number of instances in the past when water has been diverted or the flow of some -- to some extent change.Generally however until the past generation or so, the power to do this to any great extent was extremely limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.255" offset="9592999">Certain is the case which rivers is powerful in the Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.163" offset="9612643">In this day and age with increased sources of energy available and the increase in technical knowledge, the power of man has become almost unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.598" offset="9662380">Today, we find our scientist and our government leaders discussing in all seriousness the feasibility of a canal across the northern part of Florida, the advisability of blasting a path for the Rio Grande all the way to the Pacific Ocean, a construction of dams that defy the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.747" offset="9758929">There is pending in Congress today, a bill to study a 30-year project calling for the complete realignment of all the northwestern sources of water and the utilization of presently existing rivers to carry tremendous, almost unheard of volumes of water to the entire western path of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.504" offset="9857985">Of course, this works are not undertaken lightly, it is generally agreed that they are for the ultimate benefit of the people of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.535" offset="9894139">But it should not be necessary to weigh this benefit against the laws that it will do to a state if its boundaries have been changed as a result of this work of man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.963" offset="9943771">It is not our purpose here to say that this work should be discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.403" offset="9965610">It is only to suggest that the rule of law which we espouse today that the damaging effect of these works be minimized, so that the benefit of these works may be fully realized without impediment and without the necessity of any sort of compensation or payments to those who unfairly lose on an individual basis in order to satisfy public necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.191" offset="10072712">We know that our boundary -- if we know that our boundaries cannot be changed, we remove a major objection to otherwise a worthy project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.968" offset="10111791">The rule that we espouse is not a new rule of law Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.978" offset="10127882">In State versus Bowen, Supreme Court of Wisconsin, 135 northwest 494.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.662" offset="10154632">Their railroad company constructed a dam across the east channel of the Mississippi River to the west of Minnesota Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.021" offset="10183993">The boundary had formally been through this channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.421" offset="10197682">This directed the current around the other side of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.480" offset="10213878">The Court held that this constituted an avulsion saying, “It is obvious that any change brought in the flow of water by means of a dam cannot affect the question of state boundary anymore than cuts can such change produced by an avulsion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.797" offset="10287125">But neither can have the boundaries of his domain changed by avulsion or by the diversion of water affected by human agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.755" offset="10331011">In U.S. Gypsum versus (Inaudible), United States District Court Police and District of Arkansas in 1964, the Court held, "I am convinced, incidentally this was after ten years of dredging by the U.S. Engineers to accomplish the purpose."</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.289" offset="10401123">The Court held, "I am convinced that insofar as the time element is concern, that the shift of the Mississippi River from the dam way to the point way meets the necessary requirement of an avulsion."</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.131" offset="10460473">In Whiteside versus Norton, which is an Eighth Circuit Court case of 1913, the Court held that the main channel of the St. Louis River was located north of Tallas Island and at this point fall a boundary line between Minnesota and Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.417" offset="10533616">The U.S. Engineers dredged the channel south of Tallas Island, the work took from 1899 to 1902 or three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.967" offset="10575830">The Court held that title cannot be divested by artificial and arbitrary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.182" offset="10604669">The case further held that Congress without consent has no power to change the boundary between states still last less does an administrative department, meaning the United States Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.847" offset="10659318">We -- the Court held, “We cannot agree that human agencies can suddenly bring about what like acts of nature admittedly cannot accomplish.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.672" offset="10702681">Cutting this channel was analogous to avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.041" offset="10716160">It could not operate to change the boundary between the State of Wisconsin and Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.490" offset="10741864">That case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.580" offset="10758269">An appeal was refused on other grounds, but this Court through Chief Justice White said, “We are clearly of the opinion that the mere fact that Congress in the exercise of its power to improve navigation, directed the construction of the new channel affords no basis whatsoever for the assumption that thereby as a matter of federal law, rights of property if secured by state law were destroyed and new rights, a property on the assumption indulged in incompatible with that law were bestowed by Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.520" offset="10926080">Now in Louisiana versus Mississippi, 350 U.S. 5, this Court adopted the Master's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.457" offset="10965786">There, the Master held, the construction of dam and cutoff being an artificial avulsion did not alter or change the boundary between the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.616" offset="11022420">Before development of that dam and point cutoff required eight years and this Court adopted the Master's report as its own.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.632" offset="11142478">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.420" offset="11169646">We would like to open our argument by expressing the personal and the precession of the state for the fine scholar and the gentleman that the Court appointed, the Special Master to here, this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.073" offset="11220219">The fact that we might agree wholly with his factual findings as will be presented later does not detract from our high regards for him personally and as a legal scholar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.593" offset="11266299">We think he found the law of Mississippi -- I mean not all of them Mr. Justice, of the United States as it is and correctly found that the -- based thereon he declined to recommend that there'd be any changes in that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.523" offset="11342054">Now, we argued before this Court on December 10th, 1963, Louisiana had taken up the cordial of its lessee, Humble Oil and Refining Company by -- they're trying to take back what the river had formally given them and taken back an oil well to its lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.375" offset="11445499">This Court rejected that argument, authorized us -- I mean, authorized them to file their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.827" offset="11467233">But now, I think it is perfectly clear that all Louisiana is interested in is one oil well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.925" offset="11507670">They haven't given one sound legal or logical basis for changing the boundary from the live and flowing Mississippi River to a point that travels across vast and dry land -- across Mississippi accretions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.657" offset="11590531">They haven't given one reason for that except of the fact for that there's an oil well involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.435" offset="11617698">Now, we have Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.948" offset="11623758">We've lost by that river's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.258" offset="11632953">We've lost cases before this Court on the thalweg theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.002" offset="11655941">In fact, its -- most of the production in the Gulf of Mexico off from the Louisiana courts as this Court decreed that it was, was at one time a point of controversy between Mississippi and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.001" offset="11727935">And the thalweg theory adopted by this Court was followed by the Court and took it away from it and that's vast field of oil and not just -- and as this Court said in Oklahoma versus Texas, irregardless of how valuable those so vacuous rights become, value has nothing to do with changing rules of jurisdiction and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.884" offset="11847471">As this Court has heretofore announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.342" offset="11861368">Frankly, we would delighted to hear that Louisiana does not even take issue with any of the Special Master's findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.695" offset="14474762">Now, the Special Master also found that the rules of erosion and accretion are to be preferred in all instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.942" offset="14527739">That is when a boundary stream is a -- a flowing river is a boundary between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.195" offset="14560758">Now, they mentioned the thalweg grew, I don't think that's a separate rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.709" offset="14578834">The thalweg grew was established in Iowa versus Illinois, so landmark case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.396" offset="14605584">And in that case Your Honor, there was dredging -- not dredging, actually the record showed that the rock, hard rock was excavated to change the navigable channel, 300 feet closure to the Iowa side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.434" offset="14681652">It's a case in that -- that the issue in that case was who was -- detached the bridges across the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.438" offset="14709656">In the bank shown, page 4 of the Special report, that the -- who was -- someone dredged out 300 feet closer in order to make access to United States Canal farther on up the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.201" offset="14776738">That was an alleged fact and admitted for the purpose of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.129" offset="14792516">And that was the case where this Court established for the jurisprudence of this country, the rule of the thalweg, that is along the main mid-channel of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.315" offset="14849254">The Court came along 25 years later on Arkansas versus Tennessee and said, “The rule of the thalweg was settled by that decision and we will not attempt to tamper with it,” that is just 25 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.721" offset="14898782">That's been over a merely hundred now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.087" offset="14916336">So we're not just talking about one oil well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.883" offset="14931487">As the Court said in Louis -- Oklahoma versus Louisiana, we won't change the jurisdiction of property rule because of mini-oil well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.820" offset="14963252">We're talking about the boundary of everybody that borders on navigable streams in this entire country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.314" offset="14989166">Can the hand of man change it from a flowing stream as it was made by trees before the country was a nation, when it was still a nation of others?</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.987" offset="15031902">That it was made on by nature, as it was made by acts of admission and in truth and in fact was stipulated too by the parties in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.156" offset="15080594">Now, one other significant rule that we think is important, again in Arkansas versus Tennessee where this Court said, “It is settled beyond the possibility of dispute that were running streams are the boundaries between states, the same rules as between -- same rules applies as between private proprietors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.188" offset="15220715">Namely, that when the bed and the channel are changed by the natural and gradual processors known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the very thalweg bearing course of that stream.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.452" offset="15285708">Then of course it goes on and announces and in a -- and that's the exception to that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.976" offset="15303889">And that case if the Court please, it'll find when it -- when the status, that was the same case that said even though there is an avulsion, the boundary, the thalweg boundary continues to waiver by the processes of erosion and accretion until such time as the streams ceases to be navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.434" offset="15405662">And there is not one shred of proof anywhere in that merely a thousand pages of record that this was ever anything with the delight of employing Mississippi River down from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.533" offset="15454041">Now, the rules that we're talking about, that is erosion and accretion, go back -- had been traced back by this Court, and we certainly recognized it a -- the -- they're tracing back was more further than we could possibly do it but they were traced back to the rules of just any end, which was the original or the codification of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.413" offset="15549649">That is the fact that erosion and accretion, that boundary changes property, private property or public property, boundary changes by their physical fact of erosion and accretion, the boundary moved with those erosion and accretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3937.346" offset="15749329">Now, in St. Clair County versus Lovingston, which is another landmark case in this country, this Court held as a matter of law annunciated the issues and it said, one was the mix -- first one was a mixed question of fact and law, and the second was a question of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.941" offset="15827696">Then the Court said, “It is insisted by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in there that the accretion was caused wholly by obstructions placed in the river above and that thence the rule under the subject of alluvium do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.540" offset="15898122">If the fact to be so, the consequence does not follow, there is no warrant for the proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="4042.726" offset="16170841">Mississippi versus Louisiana, which was the last page we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.542" offset="16194142">This two states had anything to do with was a case involving one of these 15 cutoffs that extend from -- oh, one above Memphis and the rest of this is the lowest in the chain of following down the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.749" offset="16262896">One of this 15 cutoffs, the Court took the thalweg around the bend way and fixed it where the river had died where the navigable channel had stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.083" offset="16312320">And in the areas where it was still navigable, the thalweg was held to be the boundary in that case and this Court followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.250" offset="16368953">I don't know where they're innocent until they had anything to do with artificial thing, but in -- if the Court will note, our brief also in 134 ALR page 556, there is an excellent annotation on erosion and accretion and the artificial causes there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.341" offset="16445336">I mean this is not a thing that would -- this Court has been plagued with original actions dealing with flowing boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.572" offset="16474279">But if it -- that's Louisiana's theory, that for no reason at all in 1932 that boundaries still eroding away into Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.613" offset="16522449">For no reason at all, it's because of few drops of water came flowing down here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.944" offset="16547736">That boundary became fixed if not only would -- they'd just -- I can't conceive of the amount of litigation that will resolve, it's bad enough already with each others throat every time something valuable comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.040" offset="16620147">But if you start changing the rules and as we observed in our brief, it's very simple, the rule are -- let's say, somewhat -- I may be over simplifying and I hope not, certainly the Special Master thought that they were simple and to the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.850" offset="16687334">The rule is erosion and accretion and the one exception is avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.993" offset="16707918">Now, the reason for that rule is because people don't go out there where they end up where a river is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.435" offset="16737698">I mean, the river is flowing, it's alive, it's going day and night.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.853" offset="16759327">And the rules are -- of necessity must have to be simple because it can get to the most complicated facts of situations in the world even with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.359" offset="16801332">Now in relation to that one oil well, what flows -- I'm going to ask the clerk if he will distribute to the members of the Court copies of Mississippi Exhibit 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.929" offset="16879700">We had him taken out to the files yesterday, we have ten copies up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.737" offset="16898926">And would ask if it -- if the Court -- well, it's a (Inaudible) copy and it illustrates the point that we think needs to be illustrated at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.421" offset="16961620">As we were tracing our background on this erosion-accretion thing, frankly and I believe was the man who's credited by this -- all of having brought it, transferred it to the common law and this has been adopted as I pointed out in St. Clair versus Lovingston.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.480" offset="17025881">Now, what we point to illustrate by this is the Court held in St. Clair versus Lovingston that the river and right to future accretions is a vested right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.745" offset="17110936">It is comparable to the flux the owner of the flux and he -- being entitled to the increase or as the Court said the fruit from the tree, the man being entitled of the fruit if it's barren.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.723" offset="17166838">Now, the rule -- it's a very poor rule, it doesn't work both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.913" offset="17187631">Now this river as we pointed out has been the boundaries since the beginning of history of either these two states as states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.032" offset="17228069">Now, this that I handed you is a copy of the -- from the Land Office of Mississippi, it's a original copy of an original survey of this area of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.979" offset="17283866">Now, you will note on there that there is a U-shaped black circle on the -- starting on the upper left-hand corner and coming down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.532" offset="17330051">There is a different shaded circle -- I mean, different shaded rectangle of a thing bordering the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.219" offset="17360875">And over on the right of that different shaped rectangle, the thing there is a line that's written on there proximate bank line of maximum recession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.128" offset="17404447">That is before the river started flowing the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.493" offset="17421897">The point of this illustration is that Mississippi when it was admitted into the Union, this particular oil deposit that Louisiana now seeks us -- seeks this Court to change the rules for, was under vast lands within Mississippi.</text>

            <label>Mr. Landman Teller</label>
            <text syncTime="4588.159" offset="18352588">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.036" offset="18392085">We are here as Your Honors will find after you have an opportunity to restudy these former decisions that had been announced by this Court, dealing with a firmly entrenched rule of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.860" offset="18451435">One, which the -- must be governing millions of miles where boundaries through streams divide boundaries between property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.712" offset="18506815">And as Justice Brandeis promote in one case and most instances, it is more important that the applicable rule would be of law be settle than that it'd be settled right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.690" offset="18554671">However in this case, we don't think it's any doubt but it's not only settled by the wisdom of ages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.423" offset="18581629">But there is settled right and I'm going to carry a moment if I may to further go into that one picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.015" offset="18616007">I did not -- there is -- they are asking for a rule which will cause the Court to say, because in 1932 they -- (Inaudible) as they had a right to do and this is not questioned and I would like to cite one case which was not cited in our original briefing, I call it to the attention of the Court if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.748" offset="18718929">It's a case of Gibson versus United States, 166 United -- U.S. 269 and that's a case which recites that riparian ownership such as this is subject to the obligation to supple the consequences of the improvement of navigation or flood control in the exercise of the dominant right of the Government in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.935" offset="18843690">And that the -- when the Government does this works, they are simply asserting a right belonging to the Government to which the riparian property is subject and not of a right to appropriate private property, not burden with such servitude to public purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.292" offset="18917146">In short, this Court has held that the damage resulting from the prosecution of this improvement of a navigable highway for the public good was not the result to the taking of appellant's property and was merely incidental to the exercise of a servitude to which our property has always been subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.511" offset="18993946">Now people own lands up and down the river, know that they can gain (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.083" offset="19020278">They apply those, the states require it, subject to a paramount right of the Government to develop those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.126" offset="19048490">And it has been stipulated, as a matter of fact we agreed on a number of facts that the Government in this case in cutting this particular cutoff was exercising a lawful and unquestioned right to improve navigation and flood control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.001" offset="19111915">Now, if we start looking to cause and if we abandon the laws of accretion and erosion and just say, “What is the -- or is this going to be -- is the land going to be affected downstream because the Government did something upstream?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.531" offset="19186103">No one will ever know what they own, where it begins or where it stops, and this case is an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.652" offset="19214524">While the State of Louisiana -- when they came into this Court and they -- they've got it in their brief that they filed that and they even announced their desire, I distinctly recall but I can't be confirmed by the fact that's in -- their supplemental brief they filed before December of 1963, said that this very area in dispute were downstream 12 miles that the effect of this could be felt 12 miles down in the (Inaudible) Bend that you could measure them that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.881" offset="19339494">Now when they get to try in the case is an oil well -- we can only measure them three and a half miles because after this, the configuration starts -- calls the Louisiana to gain lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.241" offset="19384947">You see, this is not an accurate portrayal of what it existed if they say it just accrued now but it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.806" offset="19415144">There are many that are -- and absolute that you do have in this record volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.134" offset="19436460">But that is embarked but if this comes about, it has made, it has tended to make a bend that's coming in this way and going out that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.094" offset="19468330">And as it goes out this way, Louisiana has gained and they say that and the Special Master says that and their brief admits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.842" offset="19503334">So then -- but they want this Court to stop -- but when Louisiana stops gaining, (Inaudible) -- they say stop right there, this is the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.357" offset="19541368">We can measure up to here and that therefore the line (Inaudible) before somebody else comes in and measure it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.786" offset="19567073">I tell the Court if they will change this rule, you'd have to have a Special Master going to measure down further so each year it has the further effect that cause this (Inaudible) here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.051" offset="19608137">It's different that it would be before -- when it wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.149" offset="19624542">I mean, the flow of the water, the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.651" offset="19634573">And they may have computers that it'll be able to measure it all with that to New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.710" offset="19650769">And they will say in the future -- a few years come up here and say why, don't fix the line -- yes, that it was in 1932 and 1933 because this is the (Inaudible) cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.807" offset="19699148">So this idea of this new computer, we didn't know that last year but we have now gotten this new measuring device and we can tell you with positive sentient, these people who just own lands in the states who thought they would boring on the river, states who had the river as their boundary no longer have that river as a boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.792" offset="19775112">It's where the thalweg of that river happened to be when they opened the Glasscock Cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.920" offset="19799667">Now that's the reason for the wisdom of the ages, that's the reason that -- that this is a rule that has come down and applied (Inaudible) from Justinian through the civil law, through -- into Brocton, to the common law and Louisiana is going against the (Inaudible) of its own Supreme Court in this very meddle, in this very meddle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.474" offset="19885871">There is a case of Esso versus Jones in which the State of Louisiana was a party, an active party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.326" offset="19913247">And then will -- which involved Glasscock Cutoff, this area from Y, right around here, stopped there, it's all -- further it went because what was involved in that case, there were accretions up in the cutoff alone, this very cutoff, there were accretions up in this area and the -- it will question whether the private Louisiana citizens only or the State of Louisiana and there was some more.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.447" offset="20029753">So all those brought the litigation on in that case and as they said why, the private owners own the accretion until the water quit flowing and they comment citing St. Clair County versus Lovingston, their own State Supreme Court of Louisiana citing that case said, "Well, there (Inaudible) no one would be foolish enough to contend that the law of accretions and erosions was repeatable all to put out the cutoff."</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.550" offset="20134139">They say -- they said -- I dare say, no one would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.591" offset="20146364">But the Supreme Court of Louisiana was mistaken because that -- with almost concurrent the -- of State of Louisiana had determined to ask for the fixing of a permanent line, limited to an area of three and a half miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.092" offset="20220343">So we say that -- we're here tampering or they're asking that a rule be tampered with, which prompt the owners throughout this nation have lived with and know, and can learn, can determine what they own and what they don't own.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.102" offset="20292336">And these very parties did exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.432" offset="20305711">This cutoff was constructed in 1932 or 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.861" offset="20319399">Louisiana made this place leased to Humble.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.613" offset="20330371">In 1964 -- no 1948, and when they described it, they didn't described it as in the line over here between B and X.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.647" offset="20370495">They didn't do that because their job or knew that wasn't the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.627" offset="20386482">They described it as downstream along the Mississippi River flowing meandering thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.570" offset="20414276">And at the Humble -- at the part of that -- that's where they're leased to, that lease -- then Humble got some leases from a number of people in the Mississippi side, 13 in numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.930" offset="20463700">And they got together and they confected an agreement and that said agreement which is the reason for this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.288" offset="20501107">And they said on November -- well, the first thing that happened was -- Humble, this came out of the (Inaudible) as Humble -- Humble put one of its experts on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.051" offset="20552202">And he had developed that he had studied this problem and had made a report to his superiors on March the 31st, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.928" offset="20591700">And in that report and I am virtually quoting it, he said that if -- of course if you want to file the line below the foot of Glasscock Cutoff, you will have to get a current hydrographic survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.041" offset="20660140">And he mentioned that it was the thalweg of the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.636" offset="20678531">Well, in November of 1953, some six-eight months later, and he also predicted that this line was going to -- there's going to be a development favorable to Humble because this was going to shift more to the west and that is an evidence before this Court as Humble's Exhibit 10 and Humble's Exhibit 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.421" offset="20765675">Now, they did -- they went and confected this agreement between themselves in November 1953 and on a recorded document which they recited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.834" offset="20815308">That whereas the thalweg or (Inaudible) of the stream of the Mississippi River, you know that that is the community line to buying the leases, called it from Louisiana and that Mississippi leases from the various Mississippi landowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.939" offset="20867657">Which thalweg or rather a stream is subject to change from time to time pursuant to the natural action of the river and the accretion or erosion resulting there from?</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.428" offset="20905691">Now that's Exhibit C4 to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.272" offset="20921051">So they knew what the law was, the law they deny it, can this Court to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.517" offset="20942054">They went on to say that whereas after the line may change, that it may embarrass them in the operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.672" offset="20962638">And this two or (Inaudible) Humble did on Carter, I don't know what that -- had anything to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.638" offset="20982491">But the agreement was signed on behalf of Humble by Mr. Davis who was one of the -- Mr. Marvin Hugh Davis, the top vice-president and on behalf of Carter by Mr. F. M. Darwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.563" offset="21034214">And they said that that they were going to determine an operational line irrespective of the true boundary between the States of Louisiana and Mississippi at the tip, person, or any changes that may be brought therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.830" offset="21091265">So, they picked it up as between themselves and that was a line to which they drilled when they elected from Carter they get to drill a well west of that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.457" offset="21129822">So then it was the boundary line was, they didn't have any difficulty in knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.426" offset="21153646">And so I think if you got a rule of law that people know what it is, that that's a pretty good rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.666" offset="21182589">That's one that you can live with and that's one that they were able to get along with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.421" offset="21205682">Now, there are several things that they -- their exception number two while it wasn't discussed much was that they have -- except to the Master's recommendation that the only -- that this Court only decide the boundary issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.160" offset="21284571">They want this Court to decide the litigation between the (Inaudible) family who happened to own Section 11 in Mississippi and Humble Oil and Refining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.243" offset="21336921">Now, we suggest that there is no jurisdiction in the original action to let -- to determine the rights applied to citizens that the only way that this Court's jurisdiction is derived from the constitution, it's original jurisdiction, this can't be either limited by the Congress nor extended by the Congress as far as the original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.655" offset="21442560">And the appellate jurisdiction is -- takes by the Congress certainly, not would govern private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.158" offset="21464607">Now, we have in our brief covered these features and I don't think it's really -- I don't believe it's even -- that the actual jurisdiction would exist in the Court to try a damage suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.816" offset="21515180">You see, this is -- that is the way that the matter originated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.944" offset="21531690">The (Inaudible) family who owns Section 11 sued Humble Oil Company, nobody else for a subsurface trespass for the taking of oil which they said underlay their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.606" offset="21594384">They filed that suit in the United States District Court and in for the Southern District of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.786" offset="21619043">That was done on November the 27th, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.264" offset="21640986">The answers were filed by Humble, just any number of defenses, you can guess otherwise there's a estoppel, there's (Inaudible) Mississippi statute of limitations that this Court could have -- would have to decide that -- is whether its leased or whether it is not leased, there's this any number of issues that -- or in that part of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.083" offset="21740251">Now then Louisiana filed their suit saying, “Wait a minute, the thalweg is not the line as these property owners saying that Mississippi -- that we understand the State of Mississippi to believe."</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.020" offset="21784033">But it's a fixed line that exist over here by reason of this cutoff and so they filed a suit, they filed a suit on May the 13th, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.092" offset="21828336">So the question is now whether -- of course that -- we recognize everybody, that's an original action had between two sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.695" offset="21862713">Well, the line is where the thalweg happened to be in1932 or where it -- where the live thalweg is now as it was when the states were admitted in to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.359" offset="21909420">I mean, that's what -- what it was to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.957" offset="21919765">Now, has it ever ceased to be?</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.634" offset="21930527">What has caused it to ceased to be within these latitudes?</text>

            <text syncTime="5708.664" offset="22834573">Well, they not only didn't waived their immunity but they didn't even give them a warranty lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.041" offset="22852127">They just gave them a lease without a warrant so the -- I -- can I -- I mean in the sense if the question is theoretical, they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.742" offset="22890893">That -- I don't think that lease waive an immunity because it was even without warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5726.666" offset="22906567">So now, we make the other position to the -- we have the other point that with reference to the fixing of that line in 1954 that the Master -- we do question, we say that that is not supported by the others, his fixing of that line.</text>

            <text syncTime="5778.787" offset="23115128">And we have gone into that in our brief as exception number B, and I would say this to the test -- this in a way a test to the correctness of it, they have -- they didn't respond to that, they didn't do it, they didn't undertake in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="5812.070" offset="23248248">And that shows -- actually the thalweg is the deepest part of the stream, it is the flowing stream.</text>

            <text syncTime="5825.747" offset="23302896">In 1952, there was a special governmental survey right in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.512" offset="23322018">Now the only reason it happened was because there was this -- it was -- they were in trouble then, navigation was in trouble and they had to send the boat joggling down there to dig out a canal on this -- to scoop out some of the channel on the thalweg so as to get it free from navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.633" offset="23414491">And you can take this official governmental document here with the navigation charts which we have introduced into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.410" offset="23445629">This shows, they were on October 3rd, 1952, the Government actually discontinued what had been known better for as Dead Mans Crossing, actually discontinued and put down below this well site a new light called Fairview Light, now that was the passing light.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.614" offset="23522429">And if you will go by the governmental navigation charts, in all that you will find the thalweg was definitely to the west and the Master recognizes it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6223.151" offset="24892604">Your Honor, perhaps it would be best for me at this time to briefly state our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.819" offset="24923220">Louisiana is not here today asking this Court to set a permanent boundary in every instance where the work of man has had something to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.555" offset="24982152">We are not asking this Court, for example that the Government constructs a jetty and the forces of man and nature combined to accelerate accretion or erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.846" offset="25039308">We do -- we're not asking for a change in that route.</text>
            <text syncTime="6263.814" offset="25055190">We are not asking this Court to abandon the principle of law annunciated in St. Clair versus Lovingston and the land of White cases cited by our opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.769" offset="25110988">We believe that they are real and solid distinctions between those cases and the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6287.576" offset="25150276">We are saying first the law of accretion and erosion is perfectly good law unless you have an avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.863" offset="25195416">And then accretion is not preferred by the law, if it is avulsion that is just as an honorable a principle of law as the principle of accretion and erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.882" offset="25247451">They are different and they occur in different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6316.751" offset="25266991">So we are saying that all you have to do is restrict the facts of St. Clair versus Lovingston to it's own facts and apply the facts of this case which makes this an avulsion or analogous to an avulsion as has been done by this Court in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="6337.080" offset="25348284">Now, St. Clair versus Lovingston is good law if you're trying to figure out what happened in the old bend way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6347.179" offset="25388617">And I agree with my learned opponent when he said, what happened in the live river is something different with what happened up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.222" offset="25432816">St. Clair versus Lovingston would give to the riparian owners in this area the accreted lands, the built-up lands as long as there is a thread or current going through the whole bend way, that's not the situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.954" offset="25507736">If we had built an effective dam here and we have built an effective dam here, there would be no accretion or erosion in the whole bend way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6388.189" offset="25552666">It just simply couldn't happen because it is the flow that causes the accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6395.194" offset="25580774">Now, what we are dealing with is a line in the middle of the water, it is an imperceptible line, we couldn't see where this thalweg was in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.707" offset="25626749">We don't know where it is today, we don't know where it was in 1932 unless you could somehow get below that water and find out where that deepest trench, where that valley, where that main channel of navigation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.932" offset="25683696">By its very nature, it is not perceptible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.409" offset="25697593">Nor are we dealing here to a build-up of land on the Mississippi side and an erosion on the Louisiana side.</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.542" offset="25738136">We're attempting to locate a line in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6438.946" offset="25755690">So we say that there are two major distinctions as between the cases cited by our folks, St.Clair versus Lovingston and the cases that follow it and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.457" offset="25801770">First, St. Clair versus Lovingston and its follow-up cases were not dealing with boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.994" offset="25835938">We are dealing with boundaries here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6461.333" offset="25845238">Second, St. Clair versus Lovingston and these other cases were dealing with accretion to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.517" offset="25878047">That is a build-up of land on one side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.149" offset="25900513">We are not dealing with that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6478.410" offset="25913574">Needless to say every point I made in my opening argument was a distinction between St. Clair versus Lovingston in this set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.651" offset="25958504">That is, that the works of man intervene in such a drastic way as to completely reverse the forces of nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="6604.647" offset="26418573">In here Your Honor, between X and Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.365" offset="26433411">Do you remember Mr. Madden was talking about, you got accretion on the current banks, you get -- on the concave portion, you have the erosion, they're eating the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.377" offset="26477505">Now, I believe that what I have to say about progress may help us in this particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.010" offset="26520033">On page 11 of our brief, the question was asked about a particular diagram there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6638.157" offset="26552529">What we are saying on page 11 is that if left to its own devices, the river will compensate for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6649.299" offset="26597146">If the forces of nature are left alone, the heavy portions of this land will be the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.310" offset="26633195">And if that happens, the live thalweg should be the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.595" offset="26654302">But what happened here was that because wholly and solely, due to the work of the United States Engineer, the current was diverted at right angles and now heads into Louisiana where it once headed into Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.667" offset="26738625">Now let's see the effect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6686.747" offset="26746984">When the engineers made the Glasscock Cutoff, we didn't gain the area to the west of the live thalweg in the cutoff, all the engineers took there was an easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6698.747" offset="26794945">So Louisiana holds nothing in the live river from Y to B.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.803" offset="26823158">As a result of this cut and the thalweg being placed over here, Louisiana owns nothing of Dead Mans Bend, and that remains the property of the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="6722.078" offset="26888255">As a result of the cut, every survey since 1765 shows that the current had been beating against Mississippi in this point at the rate of some 70 feet a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6738.461" offset="26953770">So let's talk about that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.757" offset="26962965">If nature had been left alone, we would not be facing the Lew Carrols (ph) in this case because they not only would own the furniture, they wouldn't own any land at all because in the 33 years, this is the last, between the building of this cut, if that river had continued going 70 feet a year against Mississippi, they wouldn't be anywhere around.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.687" offset="27066723">So we're saying that what we're asking for is complete equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6771.348" offset="27085322">And it is not equity to say that a hoop hair bend Louisiana will begin again to see some accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6780.751" offset="27122939">We have lost our accretion here and we've lost our accretion in the bend below it, as a result of this cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="6788.170" offset="27152614">So you have reversed the forces of nature and Louisiana loses in two bends in a row instead of every other bend.</text>

            <text syncTime="7151.692" offset="28606694">Now, to finally summarize and close, apparently, the Master was bothered about three things in concluding that this was not an avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7168.163" offset="28672627">First, was the element of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7172.433" offset="28689659">The element of time in this case is no longer than the time element in which the United States Supreme Court in St. Louis versus Rotz said that an avulsion took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="7187.857" offset="28751412">So we can eliminate his worry about time whether this was rugged.</text>
            <text syncTime="7192.739" offset="28770952">I may also add that in terms of geologic term, in terms of the power of man to accomplish great jobs that what occurred here took only an instant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7207.172" offset="28828630">Second, the Special Master was worried about the perceptibility, yet where was the perceptibility in St. Louis versus Rotz where you had an island that just shifted a mile and a half down the river?</text>
            <text syncTime="7226.482" offset="28905848">That was not -- no more perceptible then what went on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7230.958" offset="28923820">Third, the Master and Mississippi seem to think that you had to have an actual change in the bed in order to have an avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7241.889" offset="28967497">This Court has already held time and time again that you can have an avulsion where you just have a piece of land that's slides off of my land and clops up against somebody else's land.</text>
            <text syncTime="7255.695" offset="29022772">There's no change in the bend there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7258.073" offset="29032281">This Court has held time and time again that an avulsion can occur where you have a change in course or a change in the channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="7270.098" offset="29080346">We deal with the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7272.354" offset="29089332">That we submit gentlemen is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7276.155" offset="29104588">I would like to close on a note of liberty, I never thought that I would live to appear before the United States Supreme Court arguing on one hand for the sovereignty of a state's boundary and to maintain the state's integrity and have the State of Mississippi on the other side saying, “Don't worry about federal interventions.”</text>
