            <text syncTime="35.977" offset="247306">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.583" offset="261726">This case is here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit which sustained an injunction issued against a representation election directed by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.122" offset="315852">And the question presented is whether a Federal District Court, under its general equity power has jurisdiction to enjoin a Board representation election at the suit of an employer who challenges its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.235" offset="388263">Now the underlying facts are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.720" offset="402265">In April of 1961, the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees Union filed a petition with the Board pursuant to Section 9 (c) of the National Labor Relations Act, requesting a representation election among the porters, janitors, and maids working at four bus terminals in Florida operated by respondent Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.300" offset="540609">The employees were on the payroll of Floors, a cleaning and maintenance service company which was under contract with Greyhound to provide such service at the four Greyhound terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.895" offset="606960">The Union contented that Greyhound was a joint employer of the employees, along with Floors and requested a single bargaining unit composed of the employees at the four terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.402" offset="669027">Greyhound and Floors on the other hand, contented that Floors was the sole employer of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.231" offset="708315">After hearing, the Board found that while Floors hires, pays, disciplines, transfers, and promotes the porters, janitors, and maids, Greyhound exercised sufficient common control over their working conditions as to be their joint employer along with Floors.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.113" offset="815835">It further found that a single unit consisting of all the employees under the joint employer relationship was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.692" offset="854183">Accordingly, it directed that an election be held in this unit to determine whether the employees desired to be represented by the Union for collective bargaining purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.323" offset="908622">Greyhound, contending that it was not the employer of the employees concerned and thus, that it had illegally been made a party to the representation proceeding, brought this suit in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida to enjoin the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.809" offset="990647">The District Court issued a temporary restraining order which after hearing was converted into a permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.710" offset="1026173">It predicated this action on the decision of this Court in Leedom versus Kyne which recognized District Court jurisdiction in what I shall try to show later is a very limited situation, totally distinguishable from the situation that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.560" offset="1777664">Well we submit in the first place, Your Honor, as I will try to the -- try to develop, that there is no jurisdiction in the District Court to review, at the suit of an employer, a Board direction of election no matter what the allegation is as to the basis of what are the Board's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.544" offset="1901589">Furthermore, there is no -- since an election is involved which imposes no irreparable injury, there isn't a case for equitable relief apart from the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.304" offset="1976613">Now, Kyne versus Leedom recognized that in the case of a Labor Union which was challenging not an election but a certification and which did not have the adequate remedy that the employer has opened to it that there was jurisdiction where it appeared that the Board violated a clear provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.818" offset="2086640">Now, we don't think that you reached that exception with respect to a situation where you have, first of all, a challenge to an election and, secondly, a person like an employer that has an adequate remedy under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.795" offset="2150588">But, our third ground for distinguishing Kyne against Leedom, if it is necessary to reach it is that unlike Kyne against Leedom, this is not a case where it is apparent from the face of the complaint and the exhibits attached to it which includes the Board's decision and order that the Board has acted plainly contrary to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.109" offset="2271796">And therefore to that limited extent, it may be appropriate to look at the basis for the Board's action, but the merits are not here in the sense that it is appropriate for this Court to review the entire evidentiary basis for the Board's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.061" offset="2591640">It isn't a case like Kyne against Leedom where it was open and shot that you had a specific statutory provision involved that the Board had been violating.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.607" offset="2633749">I like to say a word about the statutory scheme which this Court is familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.575" offset="2669693">Sections 10 (e) and (f) of the Act provide for review in the Court of Appeals of a final order of the Board which this Court has interpreted to mean an order entered at the culmination of an unfair labor practice proceeding under Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.599" offset="2737716">Section 9 (d) of the Act provides for review of a representation case only when it forms the basis for an unfair labor practice order and that order is itself before the Court for review under Section 10 (e) and (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="676.024" offset="2807515">Now, what does this mean in terms of this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="678.615" offset="2817860">It means this.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.203" offset="2824234">That Greyhound could have had its contentions respecting the invalidity of the election reviewed under the statutory procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.369" offset="2864880">What it could have done is it could have proceeded to an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.923" offset="2883062">If the Union lost the election, there's no injury to Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.508" offset="2909393">If the Union won and were certified, Greyhound could have refused to bargain with the Union on the ground that the certification was invalid because Greyhound was not an employer of the employees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.219" offset="2968221">This would have subjected Greyhound to an unfair labor practice charge alleging that it had refused the bargain in violation of the Section 8 (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="725.851" offset="3006777">And were the charge sustained in an order compelling bargaining issued, Greyhound could have obtained review of the bargaining order and the underlying certification under Sections 10 (e) or (f) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.470" offset="3065292">Now, it couldn't be plainer, we submit, that Congress intended that this would be the exclusive means by which an employer like Greyhound could obtain review of a Board direction of a representation election.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.620" offset="3141883">Even if the employer or even if the Board obviously in the -- on the face of the statute violated it?</text>

            <text syncTime="769.491" offset="3181380">However, this is not such a case, as I've indicated before.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.583" offset="3213667">Public Resolution 44 which created the first National Labor Relations Board to administer Section 7 (a) of the NRA provided for immediate judicial review of Board orders and representation proceedings in the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.872" offset="3286810">Experience showed that the employers took advantage of such a broad review provision that contest orders directing elections and virtually every case in which the Board had directed one, thereby delaying the commencement of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.420" offset="3357027">The Senate Report on the Wagner Act well-aware of the experience under the NRA pointed out, and I'm quoting from a passage that's in our brief, that after almost a year, not a single case in which a company has chosen to contest an election order of the Board has reached decision in any Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.957" offset="3451173">And in the House Report further pointed out that the abilities of employers to block elections had been productive of a large major of industrial strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.580" offset="3497671">What had happened was that the Union had build up employee support and with the delay in proceeding to an election, that strength had been worn away and the result was that they had to strike in order to try to maintain their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.943" offset="3563186">Now, in the Wagner Act, Congress sought to avoid this problem by providing in Section 9 (d) for this indirect review of representation proceedings that I had outlined before.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.975" offset="3627238">And, a Senate memorandum, which is in our brief, comparing the previous arrangement with the Wagner Act provision, pointed out that Section 9 (d) is a new provision intended to make it clearer that when the Board orders an election, persons affected by that order cannot come into court until after the election has been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.362" offset="3744789">And this is where a theme is repeated time and time again in the legislative debates, as we've pointed out in full in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.009" offset="3779375">And the history doesn't stop there because, in 1947, when Congress was enacting the Taft-Hartley amendments, the Hartley Bill contained a provision which would have permitted direct review of representation determinations, not at an election stage as here, but at least at the certification stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.495" offset="3889403">And one of the reasons for that was that the employer, and these are the reasons that the District Court here relies on for finding an exception for District Court review, could obtain review under the statutory procedure only by cumbersome proceedings that always involve the risk of a strike and a -- and a finding that the employer by following the statutory course had committed an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.922" offset="4015104">And notwithstanding that, Congress, in conference, deleted this provision, keeping 9 (d) as it was under the Wagner Act and Senator Taft, explaining the deletion, pointed out that other -- that the House provision would have permitted dilatory tactics in representation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.697" offset="4126177">The nub of this is, we submit, that to permit Greyhound to obtain District Court review in the situation here is the sanction precisely what Congress sought to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.059" offset="4183646">Now, what has come to Kyne against Leedom, which I indicated at the outset, recognized an exception to the general preclusion of District Court review of Board representation proceedings and the case last term, Sociedad, which recognized a further situation for District Court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.411" offset="4305063">Although the court took great pains, we submit to emphasize that it was not impending thereby to open up the very limited exception that Kyne had -- had created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.778" offset="4374444">The situation in Kyne was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.794" offset="4390536">The Union won a Board election in a unit consisting of 233 professional and 9 non-professional employees, and was certified as the representative in that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.979" offset="4459290">You had the election, you had the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.989" offset="4475277">After the certification issue, the Union brought suit in the District Court to set aside the certification on the ground that the nine professionals had been included in the unit without the professionals first having had an opportunity to vote separately on the question of whether they wanted them in unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.766" offset="4566392">It was alleged that this was contrary to Section 9 (b) (1) of the statute which provides that professional and non-professional employees shall not be included in the same unit unless the majority of the professionals' vote were such included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.001" offset="4635355">In other words, you had a very narrow provision that seemed to be very specific and it seemed like the Board had very clearly violated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.925" offset="4687078">This Court found that the Board's action was plainly in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.789" offset="4726575">But the Court didn't stop there, we submit, as we read its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.667" offset="4746010">It further pointed out that such unlawful action had inflicted an injury on the professional employees because the election had already been held and the certification it issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.520" offset="4793448">And that this we believe is significant, at the absence of jurisdiction of the federal courts would mean, and now I'm quoting from the opinion, "A sacrifice or obliteration of a right to which Congress has given professional employees where there is no other means within their control to protect and enforce that right."</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.580" offset="4893654">The Court held that, in those circumstances, it could not be inferred that Congress had intended to foreclose a judicial remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.958" offset="4939212">Now, as I pointed out, this Court only last term in the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.979" offset="5403251">In the Kyne case, we made the argument in a Footnote in our brief that we thought that the Union in Kyne was in a position where it could have availed itself of the statutory review procedure because theoretically possible, it was possible that a refusal of bargain charge could have been filed against that Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.503" offset="5505337">However, the Court of Appeals in the Kyne case found and we believe that this Court accepted that finding in affirming the Court of Appeals, that in the circumstances presented in Kyne, the statutory review procedure was not as dependable and as reliable as is the statutory review procedure for the case of the employer in the situation here for the reason that, if the Professional Union refuse to bargain except in a Union -- in a unit which was different from the unit certified by the Board, it was most unlikely that the employer would file an unfair labor practice charge against that Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.476" offset="5725288">It was much more likely, the Court of Appeals found, that the employer would be content or just not bargain at all as he was free to do prior to the Board certification because the employer could hardly be subjected to an unfair labor practice on his part for refusing the bargain in the unit other than the one that the Board had certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.172" offset="5816090">Secondly, there was a possibility that the nine non-professionals could have filed a charge against the Professional Union for refusing to bargain on their behalf, but the Court of Appeals found that that was very remote and unlikely in view of the fact that these nine represented such a minority in the total picture that they would not be wanting to jeopardize the already bad relations that they had with the Professional Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.292" offset="5956524">Now, the case of the employer, which is what we have here, is totally different.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.937" offset="6247111">They would be only economic strikers who would be subject to replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.198" offset="6264142">Furthermore, the Union might get into some problems under 8 (b) (7) which limits the time that you can strike-picket for recognition if you haven't gotten an unfair labor practice writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.443" offset="6321194">Secondly, the fact -- whether or not the Union gets review at the district -- or whether not the employer gets a review at the District Court or not of the Board's representation determination is not going to avoid the likelihood of a strike because the setting aside of the representation determination is not going to preclude the Union from striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.647" offset="6457971">And as a matter of fact, it was Congress' judgment that the chances of getting a strike were much more likely if you bottled up the representation proceeding at the election stage and let things drag for two to three years before you get that resolved and then look at the situation that you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.998" offset="6539368">If ultimately, the Board is to prevail, the employer gets a second bite at the apple because he still cannot be ordered to do anything until the Board issues a bargaining order and then we got to go back up to the statutory procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.271" offset="6796413">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.755" offset="6810415">At the outset, I should like if I may to respond to a few of the questions that Mr. Justice Goldberg posed to Counsel for the Government to explain a little bit further about the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.202" offset="6864227">In the first instance, the inquiry, Mr. Justice, with reference to the record before the Court, there was no point in there being a record before the Court because this was not an action to review a finding of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.322" offset="6920652">This was an action to vacate an -- an act unlawfully taken by the National Labor Relation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.606" offset="6949804">I will elucidate on that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.097" offset="6959731">But in this case the petition -- the direction of election which was attached to the complaint which was the only thing before the Court besides certain affidavits and other attachments to the complaint, showed on its face that the Board had made finding of fact which as a matter of law required under the expressed congressional intent in enacting the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.143" offset="7063907">The Board had made a finding which it was prohibited from making as expressly as did the Board make in its error of statutory construction in the Kyne case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.380" offset="7112913">The history of the case goes a little bit further than behind the date of the petition for an election in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.490" offset="7145305">Attached to -- and also attached to the complaint and made a part of the record in this case is also a finding -- a set of findings of fact and conclusions of law and an order of the United States District Judge for the then Southern District of Florida, now Middle District of Florida, wherein when this contract came up in 1954, not just 1960 when the petition for election was filed, in 1954, the -- the employer told the Union that it was going to format this work to an independent contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.417" offset="7297024">The Union said that if you do -- and this a matter of record in this case, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.586" offset="7321684">The Union said, "If you do, we will have a system-wide strike which will continue until you breach your contract with the pro -- proposed independent contract."</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.542" offset="7361494">Therefore, rather than experiencing that, the Union and the employer agreed to forbade either putting the contract into effect or to instigating a strike until a declaratory judgment complaint was filed with the District Court and resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.302" offset="7432547">Such declaratory judgment complaint was filed with Judge Simpson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.326" offset="7448639">He made findings of fact, conclusions of law, including that this was a contract established in an independent contract to employee-employment relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship, insofar as Greyhound and Floors were concerned, and that the company was not violating this contract by forming this workout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.475" offset="7537246">So those matters, Mr. Justice Goldberg would -- were determined some five years prior to the initiation of the petition for -- for election in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.866" offset="7590849">Now, we have much of and we live much with legislative histories, but I should like very much to call the Court's attention what the legislative hence -- history as of the time of this case, as of the present time, really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.150" offset="7660022">The early legislative history, as Counsel for the Government has pointed out quite correctly, arose in the enactment -- the preparation for the enactment of the Wagner Act in 1935 because of this Court's declaring the Section (7) (a) of the Industrial Recovery Act and Public Resolution 44 implementing that Act unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.462" offset="7753226">In the history of that Act, the legislative history the -- of the Wagner Act, it was pointed out and quite correctly, that the -- that Resolution 44 under which the Government had theretofore proceed, had permitted anyone aggrieved by any order at any stage of the proceedings to go to a Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States and obtain relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.087" offset="7859702">And that the history had been up to the time of the enactment of the Wagner Act that employers did frequently go, more often than not, take a direct review prior to any further administrative proceedings and that that was bad, that the National Labor Policy was not properly being implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.777" offset="7934516">So to correct that situation, the legislative history is full of language referring to employers and employers seeking an injunction but not one bit of all that legislative history refers to employers as distinguished from -- from Unions only because it was not until the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 that Unions and employers had comparable responsibilities and duties under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.673" offset="8050082">Therefore, their effort to distinguish between the right of an employer, on the one hand, to go to a District Court, if there'd be such a right in anyone, as against that of a Union is not a valid distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.619" offset="8105880">There is no legislative history, let me say, that establishes that as a valid distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.667" offset="8130017">The early cases which came before this Court on this subject matter and with regard to which this Court withheld jurisdiction to act, withheld the question until the Leedom v. Kyne case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.377" offset="8188844">Did not decide this question nor did any decision of this Court at any time ever hold that action of an administrative agency, acting beyond the scope of administrative authority, that is within the confines of the authority and powers vested in any such agency by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.446" offset="8273168">At no time had this Court ever held that that was not judicial -- judicially subject to a complaint of petition to a District Court of the United States under the judicial code on its general powers of equity to review an Act taken up pursuant to an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.110" offset="8347773">And to obtain relief if that were contrary to a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.906" offset="8370970">Now, when we got into the actual enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, and you, legislative history, may it please the Court, began to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.036" offset="8423528">We began for the first time to subject Unions to the same sort of responsibility in their acts as employers that they have theretofore been subjected to under the Wagner Act, did more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.429" offset="8481102">A lot of this -- a lot of this legislative history that predates the Taft-Hartley Act is based upon the fact that the Wagner Act said that the authority to enforce unfair labor practice proceedings was exclusively within the National Labor Relations Board, that's in 10 (a) of the Wagner Act and 10 (a) of the Taft-Hartley Act effective August 23, 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.040" offset="8595519">The language was intentionally stricken by the Congress to remove the implication that the Board had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.771" offset="8634493">Now, the court -- the Taft-Hartley Act did two of the very important things which as I say, do violence, if not destroy a lot of the previous legislative history with regard to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.052" offset="8691545">First, the only -- the early cases, including the Myers case, the first one in 1938, Myers versus Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, expressly relied upon the fact that the -- whoever was involved, be it an employer or a Union, had adequate judicial recourse by commitment of an unfair labor practice and going through the entire tortures proceeding of an unfair labor practice and then having the case reviewed prior to being made to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.579" offset="8837726">Now the Taft-Hartley Act stopped that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.388" offset="8848906">The Taft-Hartley Act included a new section known as Section 10 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.448" offset="8869177">And Section 10 (j) of the Taft-Hartley Act that says -- says, "Prior to a hearing, at any time when the Board has issued a complaint that a -- an employer or a Union has committed an unfair labor practice that the Board may go to the United States District Court and obtain an injunction."</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.915" offset="8950993">And the court -- and the Board and the courts have repeatedly granted injunctions, compelling both Unions and employers to bargain before any Circuit Court of Appeals has ever had a shot at that -- to review such an action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.302" offset="9944586">That legislative history is set forth in pages 10 and 11 of the brief of the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.731" offset="10074258">What the Board had done and what it has done for sometime before was to consider economic and social purposes as governing the question of the employment relationship for the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.414" offset="10385011">In the first place, as I say the record reflects in this case that if the -- if a -- my client were not protected by an order of the court that says he is not the employer in the case, he would be the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.721" offset="10450213">And his right to not be an employer came into being the instant that the Board granted this decision of direction of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.517" offset="10485426">Therefore, he went to the court the very earliest time that right came into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.238" offset="10504338">He destroys -- destroyed that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.286" offset="10512488">The history in the record of this case shows that the Union would probably more than -- probably, rather than probably not because of their threats existing when the employee -- when the court held that the employer was not the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.498" offset="10589393">That they would then go into a system-wide strike and shut him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.467" offset="10609246">Now, I would like to buttress that with one further argument along that line and that is the simple fact that what does happen, we have all of these legislative -- legislative history and all these rules of probability and possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.214" offset="10672253">What happened in this case for instance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.194" offset="10684165">There certainly no labor strife that arose from the granting of this injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.274" offset="10704436">That was the thing that has caused this Court to act very cautiously in this field of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.365" offset="10728782">Secondly, and adverting again to jurisdiction, the legislative history of the Act from its very inception, including the old RIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.349" offset="10776743">The legislative history was related to the Congress' desire that these actions of the administrative agency not be reviewed, where?</text>

            <text syncTime="2780.239" offset="11224377">It's engaged generally -- as a matter of fact, it was actually engaged in the cleanup under a contract in the federal building both in -- in Jacksonville and in -- in Tampa, where we tried this case once before the Fifth Circuit and once before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.600" offset="11301804">These -- these people rotate these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.908" offset="11314970">That's why it's most important that there is a finding by the Board that they transfer them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.182" offset="11332106">That means they transfer them to work all over everywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.341" offset="11356766">These people are transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.820" offset="11366693">These people represented at the time of the hearing less than 6% of the total employment of Floors' employees in each of the four areas described without regard to any other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.209" offset="11420191">Therefore, we get to the real point is that, why was Greyhound ever named in this case as an employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.194" offset="11444120">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.094" offset="11451747">It was named as a practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.207" offset="11460211">First -- first, the Union filed a petition for election in which it named Floors, Inc. as its employee -- employer and setup the same proposed unit, Jacksonville, Miami, St. Petersburg, and Tampa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.117" offset="11511829">Those -- those employees of Floors working at Greyhound's terminal but they named Floors as the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.259" offset="11544430">Well, of course, it was not an appropriate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.775" offset="11554461">They could never have gotten any.</text>
