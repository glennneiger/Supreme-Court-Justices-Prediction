            <text syncTime="22.375" offset="192867">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.105" offset="207809">Your Honors granted a writ of certiorari to review a -- an affirmance in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which held first that the name of a confidential informant in a -- an affidavit for a search warrant, need never be disclosed in a proceeding in which the defendant requires disclosure because he is asserting his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and second, said the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, "In any event, such disclosure need never be made unless the defendant can show that the informant was present at the time of the commission of the offense and indeed that he was the moving party in the commission of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.606" offset="397772">Those are difficult and disturbing questions here for the -- this Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.430" offset="429119">It is as disturbing the conviction as I have ever encountered.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.485" offset="445315">For not only is the continuing viability of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution at state here in the decision of the Seventh Circuit, but the petitioner himself stands burdened by a conviction for which he has received a sentence of 10 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.934" offset="511143">On the product of conjecture which is a word used by the Government in its brief, conjecture as to whether or not the informant might have helped him to exonerate himself from the accusation of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.828" offset="566732">A third issue is at state here because the grant of certiorari was not limited to the points raised in the petition and that is under the circumstances here, was there sufficient evidence upon which to predicate the conviction, a conviction of possession of stolen property moving in interstate commerce, knowing the same to have been stolen.</text>

            <label>Mr. Julius Lucius Echeles</label>
            <text syncTime="146.200" offset="688149">Yes, these are the three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.164" offset="695986">One of the questions was the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.265" offset="712391">Coming to the last point first, whether or not, under circumstances such as here, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.712" offset="746245">The facts are rather simple and essentially are not in dispute between the Government and the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.001" offset="771427">Petitioner was 55 years of age, married, lived with his wife in a family owned home.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.681" offset="794102">He and his wife owned a home on the north side of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.233" offset="808312">He owned a grocery store and a meat market and his hours of activity were from 5:30 in the morning when he got up until about 7:30 or 8:30 at night when he came home.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.199" offset="860139">On a day in question, March 22, 1962, the FBI agents in the execution of a search warrant previously obtained from a Commissioner in Chicago, executing a search warrant, went to the basement of the home of the Rugendorfs and in closets in the basement, found 81 furs which were subsequently identified as having been stolen in two burglaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.376" offset="948851">One in Shreveport, Louisiana in December of 1961 and the other in Mountain Brook, Alabama in January of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.939" offset="995140">Based on those facts and those facts alone, Rugendorf was convicted because furs were found in his home, in the basement in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.801" offset="1042578">There was no evidence that Rugendorf himself knew of the existence of furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.798" offset="1062536">There was no evidence by the Government that he as much suspicioned the existence of the stolen furs in his basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.116" offset="1091793">The affidavit in support of the search warrant obtained by an FBI affiant revealed that Sam Rugendorf, petitioner here, had a brother, Leo Rugendorf.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.986" offset="1139336">And that from the facts as brought out both in the hearing on the motion to suppress the evidence and in the affidavit itself that Leo Rugendorf, brother of Sam, was a known fence, receiver of stolen property and that he, Leo, was associated with certain known thieves identified in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.650" offset="1234004">And that these thieves were the ones, according to the confidential informants, who had committed the burglaries in Alabama and in Mountain Brook, but not a word either in the affidavit or during the trial or during the hearing on the motions to suppress the evidence that Sam Rugendorf had knowledge of the existence of the furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.352" offset="1320730">Therefore, the Government's theory was that Rugendorf was guilty because he was in constructive possession of the furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.584" offset="1345703">But even if one is in constructive possession of stolen property, the next fact has to be decided from naked constructive possession of stolen property thus, knowledge of the stolen content of those items become chargeable to the constructive possessor by inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.034" offset="1427519">There is no single case decided by this Court which decides that constructive possession gives rise to a further inference that the possessor posses them knowing the same to have been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.186" offset="1484152">There is one case in the Court of Appeals, Russo, which we cite, which states that under circumstances such as this, he cannot pile the inference upon the inference and the presumption upon the presumption, and that conclude guilty knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.095" offset="1547786">With respect to the other matters raised in the petition, the Court of Appeals has taken some dicta in Roviaro case, in this Court's Roviaro case, which apparently is interpreted differently by different circuits, the Ninth Circuit in Costello, interpreted Roviaro as requiring disclosure of confidential informant were unnecessary in a proceeding attacking the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.133" offset="1671920">The Fourth Circuit, the Winding case followed by the Seventh Circuit in this case, decided that in the proceeding where the Fourth Amendment is the issue, where constitutional rights of a defendant under the Fourth Amendment are at stake that he may not obtain the benefit of disclosure even where disclosure would be helpful and relevant to the defense and even where the disclosure is essential to a fair determination of the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.402" offset="1804936">As to that aspect of the case, that is a case and that is a point, a first impression before this Court, Roviaro did not decide that point at all and some of the Courts of Appeals have gone off on dicta in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.583" offset="1873690">Roviaro was a factual situation in which a -- in a narcotic case, the so-called informant was with, according to the Government, was with the seller of narcotics to a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.930" offset="1935130">There was no issue in the Roviaro case of search warrant, of demand in a motion to suppress the evidence and there is no case decided by this Court previous to Roviaro which has it.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.809" offset="2002631">And as I say, the several circuits have a different play.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.205" offset="2020185">I see no reason why it is less important when one asserts his right under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.504" offset="2053413">And then according to the Seventh Circuit -- according to the Fourth Circuit, cannot get information helpful in showing the invalidity of the search warrant than it -- then it is, if he needs that information which is essential to his case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.905" offset="2119032">Because then the Courts of Appeals are downgrading the viability, the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.017" offset="2155395">What they are saying is that you may not try to show invalidity in a search warrant because the Government's privilege to secrete the name of the informer is more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.275" offset="2208475">Well, that poses a difficult question and a difficult situation for a defendant who as in the -- in this instance claimed at the trial, claimed at the time of his arrest, claimed at the trial, claimed in the Court of Appeals, complete innocence, complete absence of any connection with any of the details of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.901" offset="2302934">He only owned a house in which there were furs found in the basement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Julius Lucius Echeles</label>
            <text syncTime="559.029" offset="2339506">He was at his store, working in his store on the south side of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.969" offset="2363225">The raid was made, that is the entry into the house, pursuant to the search warrant was made around 5:00 or 5:15 p.m. on March 22, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.561" offset="2409618">By some telephone calls and some signals, the FBI raiders called their office who contacted agents in the field who were then on their automobiles and then the two agents went to -- not the place where Sam Rugendorf owned his store, but went to another store, Rugendorf Brothers Meat Market, which in the affidavit was alleged to have been managed by Sam.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.344" offset="2508779">That information was false, we demonstrated and that information allegedly came from a confidential informant previously known to have been informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.181" offset="2540126">The agents did not find Sam Rugendorf at the Rugendorf Brothers Meat Market where it was alleged in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.768" offset="2570428">He was the manager, excuse me, but ascertained that he owned the store some miles distance about two or two and a half miles away, they went to the store and they arrested Sam Rugendorf at about 6:00 or 6:15 p.m. on that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.249" offset="2620374">He was at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.904" offset="2626957">He denied any knowledge, acquaintanceship or connection with the furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.809" offset="2642631">He expressed surprise, indignant surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.375" offset="2660916">The -- and that is the only connection that the Government has made with Sam Rugendorf that he had a consanguinary relationship with his brother, and that the old law of blood tincture, the old English law of blood tincture, has now come to play in this case because Sam is hoist in this conviction only because he was Leo's brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.461" offset="2773243">How did the furs come to be in the basement?</text>
            <text syncTime="669.707" offset="2782229">That is conjectural.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.931" offset="2791111">That is one of the reasons we wanted to have the identity of the confidential informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.743" offset="2814307">The evidence shows without contradiction by the Government that Sam and his wife, Belle, went to Florida on a vacation on February the 17th, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.660" offset="2850043">They lived in the house alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.690" offset="2862164">They gave their key, that is Sam gave his key, to a neighbor two doors down a pharmacist by the name of Rosen, he gave the key to this house to his sister, he gave the key to his house to his son and gave the key to his house upon request to Leo Rugendorf, his brother, for the purpose of watching the house in their absence, cleaning the walk from snow, observing that the house is taken cared of, keeping the heat up in the two weeks absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.521" offset="2981491">Sam Rugendorf and his wife returned to Chicago on March the 4, 1962, came to the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.569" offset="3009599">He testified that he'd never went into the basement during -- between the time of March 4, 1962, they returned to Chicago and the time of his arrest on March 22, 1962 because he had no reason to go into the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.263" offset="3068426">He testified without contradiction that the house was heated by gas, that the thermostats controlling the gas heat was in the living room and he had no reason to go into the basement that is hours in taking care of the store, consumed seven days of his week.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.226" offset="3372283">But it seems to me that there are two basic and separate points here, one is the -- one is the question of whether or not there was probable cause and a valid warrant to conduct the search and the search was made and did in fact disclose that there were 81 stolen fur coats in this man's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.802" offset="3462562">That -- that face of the case involves a set of issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.331" offset="3524733">But then quite a different and separate issue, it seems to me, as the probative value of the facts that these fur coats had been found in this man's house in his prosecution at the criminal trial and as -- I have difficulty when you mix them all up because it seem -- but it seems to me quite discrete issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.124" offset="3663914">There were in the affidavit a number of items set out by the agent affiant as attending to disclose to the Commissioner issuing the warrant that there were reasonable grounds for the issuance of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.983" offset="3715323">Upon hearing, it was demonstrated that facts which the agent affiant allegedly got from his confidential informant previously known to have been reliable to him, were false in some respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.512" offset="3781465">It was shown to have been false that when the agent informant said that he received information that Sam Rugendorf was the manager of Rugendorf Brothers Meat Market that that information was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.454" offset="3837158">It was false in another and even more important respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.820" offset="3854608">Agent Moore, the affiant agent, stated that he received information from Agent McCormick naming his informant this time that Agent McCormick told him that a Chicago police officer, Kelleher, told him that Sam Rugendorf managed -- that Sam Rugendorf managed the Rugendorf Brothers Meat Market.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.474" offset="3953246">That was false because Officer Kelleher took the stand, if this Court please and said that he did not tell Agent McCormick that Sam Rugendorf managed the -- the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.359" offset="4008835">Well, if those facts were false and there were no other facts of which Sam Rugendorf could dispose were false, that is, he did not contend that there was no burglary in Alabama or Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.733" offset="4238294">The fact remains that at the trial, there were two such burglaries fitting the description, the one in Shreveport, Louisiana and the one in Mountain Brook, Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.167" offset="5028028">So after the jury was selected, Agent Moore testified without too much cross-examination or any, that he executed the search warrant, that he found the furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.908" offset="5067003">Then the Government made its offer into evidence of the 81 furs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.600" offset="5117785">It was during that motion that demand for the informants was renewed and renewed repeatedly, renewed as vigorously as a defense counsel can until the judge foreclosed any further questioning and stated that he foreclosed further questioning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.463" offset="5477230">The Courts of Appeals have taken off because search warrant was not involved to determine that only when it is necessary and relevant to the defense in the case was disclosure compelled and that is what I meant to say although I stated it rather badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.154" offset="5535953">The Government in this case has shifted its position with respect to the demand for the relevant information of the informant at every level of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.586" offset="5577749">In the trial court, the only reason the Government came for failure to disclose is not that the information would not be either relevant or helpful or necessary for a fair consideration of the case, but because the information might possibly lead to the death of the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.271" offset="5648488">On the Court of Appeals' level, the brief written by the Government stated that, "It is only where it is essential to the individual's right to prepare his defense that we're entitled to the information."</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.585" offset="5697703">Before this Court, in its brief, the Government has taken a third position shifting again, stating that it abandoned its earlier contention that disclosure is appropriate only where the -- the -- the informant is first proven to have been the moving party in the commission of offense and participated in the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.444" offset="5773145">They abandoned the -- the contention that information may not be disclosed only where it is relevant to an impeachment of the search warrant under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.184" offset="5820061">They now say that the defendant must demonstrate fraud in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.408" offset="5840959">They don't say they we're not entitled to it at all but we -- but if we demonstrate fraud, we might possibly get the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.041" offset="5867499">They, then in this Court, suggest that no fraud was committed upon the magistrate because the magistrate heard from policeman A who said he got it from policeman B and if even policeman B was lying, that didn't make policeman A affiant agent of the liar necessarily and with respect to the final contention of the Government, they state that -- and they abandoned all of the positions and they state that under Roviaro, the defendant Rugendorf, might have been entitled to relevant information about the informant had we presented that information properly in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.644" offset="6001977">Well, we presented it as repeatedly and as vigorously and as forcefully as we could until we were foreclosed from the trial court because we said if we have the name of the informant, we suggested that the trial court, it will probably prove Rugendorf's innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.168" offset="8843995">Now the affidavit, if the Court please, at page 7 of the record, is quite ambiguous on the point whether the agent McCormick originated the statement that petitioner had been the manager of the Meat Market or whether McCormick merely relayed the information from Officer Kelleher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.419" offset="8941066">The affidavit doesn't make it at all clear which was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.681" offset="8966144">The sources of clarification of that, of course, would have been the Officer Kelleher, who did testify on the hearing on the motion to suppress and the Officer McCormick, who is either the originator or the channel of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.078" offset="9035734">Now, it's noteworthy that Officer McCormick did not testify, Special Agent McCormick did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.642" offset="9065932">He was, at the time of the trial, in the hospital as the record shows at page 18, but the Court might note that from June 4th when the motion to suppress evidence was filed until the first week in July when the trial began, there was an opportunity, a month's opportunity to take the deposition of McCormick, confront him with the fact and obtain clarification of the fact that appears in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.264" offset="9200410">I think it's further significant that when of -- Agent Moore was on the witness stand, Agent Moore was not asked on examination by petitioner whether McCormick originated the information or whether McCormick truly said that the information came from Kelleher and therefore, it can't be said that Officer Moore lied in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.006" offset="9303437">There are two hypotheses which were left entirely open by petitioner which are as consistent with the text of the affidavit as the notion that Officer Kelleher originated this information himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.063" offset="9395597">Now, the extremely insubstantial claim that this type of inaccurate information perhaps shown after the fact to be incorrect in a minor respect, the claim at that time of a -- an error in an affidavit, is ground for disclosure of a confidential informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.782" offset="9494549">Raises in the most serious way, we submit, the question what is the weight of the quality of the public policy behind the confidentiality of an informant.</text>

            <text syncTime="5549.416" offset="22301027">To answer Mr. Justice Black's question, was there a case decided by this Court in which this Court determined that a hearing on the truth or falsity of a warrant was proper at a hearing, we refer Your Honor to Giordenello versus United States, 357 U.S. 480.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.365" offset="22392874">And it is my belief in that case that Your Honors held that a hearing on the truth of -- on the truth or falsity of the warrant is appropriate after arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.961" offset="22447208">With respect to the Chief Justice's question, whether or not anyone was prosecuted, I did not in my original argument, make any comment on -- on it because it was -- it holds the record, but I state to this Court without further contradiction that nobody else to this date was arrested or prosecuted whether somebody will be or not, it's something which I have no knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.672" offset="22546056">May I come to Pearce, that's a Seventh Circuit case from which this case arises, that's 275 F.2d, in that case, the affiant to get a search warrant was an FBI agent, he said under oath, “I received information from a confidential informant previously known to me to be reliable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.900" offset="22631006">He didn't even say that he got it second hand removed as the agent said of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.559" offset="22649605">The trial judge there in the District Court of Chicago, as distinguished from the trial judge here in the District of Chicago, permitted under Giordenello, a hearing on the validity of the search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.783" offset="22702477">The following facts occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.637" offset="22709896">The affiant agent revealed that he did not get the information from a confidential informant previously known to him to -- previously known to him to have been reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.829" offset="22762663">He got it from his superior in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.488" offset="22773321">His superior in Chicago got it from a parallel individual, a comparable FBI agent in Portland, Oregon or Seattle, Washington I forget.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.690" offset="22814177">And that that individual got it from an agent who got it from the confidential inform -- informant who was named John Pearce, the brother of the defendant in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.977" offset="22855241">John Pearce was then brought to court, the confidential informant, and he testified under oath that he did not speak to any agent until September 9 of the particular year in question, but the affidavit asserted facts known to the affiant on September 7, two days before the affiant agent was alleged under oath, to have spoken to a series of agents who got their information from an informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.626" offset="22981883">The confidential informant in that case, was not a confidential informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.779" offset="23002467">He did not exist according to the affidavit and he never before in his life gave information to the agent and the information alleged by the affiant that he gave was incorrect in the affiant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.490" offset="23049383">Now, how would Pearce be reversed in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, unless the trial judge there permitted what the trial judge here did not permit?</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.930" offset="23099120">Where is the defendant going to go?</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.654" offset="23106017">What can he do to demonstrate the falsity of the affidavit?</text>

            <text syncTime="5783.020" offset="23235480">The Government has attempted to trivialize it in every brief they have said, when the affiant gave information so-called, to the affiant agent, the confidential informant said that he saw one of the -- one of the burglars swish in the Meat Market managed by Rugendorf.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.225" offset="23316250">The Government now asserts to this Court, that's trivial.</text>
