            <text syncTime="55.691" offset="326092">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.347" offset="348766">That court affirmed the order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denying petitioner a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.844" offset="382725">Petitioner seeks the great writ on the ground with his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, had been violated by his conviction for first degree premeditated murder in the courts in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.794" offset="434552">The murder of which petitioner was convicted took place shortly after 1 a.m. on June 14, 1960 in Brooklyn, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.651" offset="469974">Not long thereafter, petitioner was arrested as he alighted from a taxi -- taxicab in the vicinity of Brooklyn's Cumberland Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.717" offset="502262">He was then suffering from gunshot wounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.030" offset="515532">At about 2:00 a.m., petitioner was questioned in the hospital's x-ray room by a police detective and there made a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.305" offset="548551">The police notified the District Attorney's Office and an Assistant District Attorney came to the hospital and beginning at 3:55 a.m., took a second transcribed confession from petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.242" offset="668296">However, it is only the admission of the second confession that made to the Assistant District Attorney that petitioner contends violated his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.628" offset="705912">At the time the second confession was taken, petitioner was suffering from bullet wounds in the liver and lung.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.666" offset="822000">In all, the confession took approximately five minutes and was concluded at 4 a.m.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.106" offset="1311848">The physician then testified that while drug reaction is an individual matter, it takes about 15 minutes for demerol to be effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.188" offset="1384155">Thereupon, petitioner's counsel objected to the use of the confession on the ground that it was obtained involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.285" offset="1408502">During his own testimony, petitioner said repeated -- repeatedly that he could not remember having been interrogated by the Assistant District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.185" offset="1444133">The trial court submitted the question of voluntariness to the jury with the instruction that if they found the confession to have been involuntary, they were to -- to exclude it and to base their determination of guilt or innocence only on the other evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.064" offset="1967626">This Court first said in Brown against Mississippi that the use of an involuntary confession in the state trial vitiates a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.844" offset="1998764">That rule has been reiterated frequently and the Court has made it very clear and as early as well as its latest cases, the last two being Lynumn against Illinois and Haynes against Washington this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.046" offset="2043591">That in the face of an involuntary confession, a state conviction will not stand regardless of the sufficiency of the other evidence to sustain the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.125" offset="2079848">But the constitutional rule of Brown against Mississippi is at least in the opinion of New York and other jurisdictions that employ a similar admissibility procedure subject to one crucial qualification, that is that there maybe introduced into evidence without vitiate a -- vitiating a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.042" offset="2151528">Any confession which is not involuntary as a matter of law, that is any question whose voluntariness is a fair question of fact, provided the jury is instructed to disregard the confession if it finds it to have been involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.060" offset="2211610">The authority for -- for -- for this view is said to be Stein against New York, also dictum in Spano against New York, also a statement by this Court and its opinion in Rogers against Richmond to the effect that the procedure for determining admissibility of confessions may matter for state procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.621" offset="2289873">Petitioner contends that this idea and the admissibility procedure that springs from it is fundamentally and demonstratively in conflict with the general rule that admission of an involuntary confession must vitiate a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.064" offset="2343581">Under the New York procedure, the constitutional protection against coerced confession is largely an illusion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel G. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="613.743" offset="2558307">And I believe that while the procedure in the federal courts is not entirely clear, some federal courts follow the procedure suggest the so-called Massachusetts variant as some courts simply require the judge to make the permanent -- the decision of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.338" offset="2616717">The constitutional deficiency of the New York procedure can best be illustrated by assuming that the jury did in facto -- in fact, took one of the several causes of action that was open to it under the trial court's instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.271" offset="2672410">That is that they found the confession to have been involuntary and that they also found that there was enough -- there was sufficient other evidence to sustain a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.744" offset="2706369">Of course, because the jury rendered the general verdict, we have no way of knowing whether that was in fact what the jury did but because we do not, it is only fair and testing petitioner's constitutional rights to assume that the jury took the cause of action that petitioner contends it was most disadvantageous to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.990" offset="2795290">On the assumptions given, we thus have a situation in which the Brown protection would have had meaning for petitioner, only if he had been able to establish to the satisfaction of the trial judge or later to the satisfaction of the New York Court of Appeals, that a finding of voluntariness would have been unreasonable finding as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.107" offset="2875852">Otherwise, the confession would go to the jury as it did in this case and a conviction would stand despite the fact that on our assumptions, the jury found it to have been involuntary and perhaps we might also assume that the judge would have found it to have been involuntary as well, if he had been asked that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.602" offset="2937814">What I'm saying is that in effect, all it takes for a prosecutor to place any confession before a New York jury is to present enough proof of voluntariness to raise a fair question of fact on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.559" offset="2985566">I suggest that as a practical matter, this is a very easy burden for the prosecution and one that is completely unfair to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.790" offset="3018480">It is also necessary to recognize of course, that there is no legitimate relationship between constitutional protection and the degree of certainty of constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.382" offset="3060903">That this is so and that the New York procedure flies in the phase of this conclusion, is apparent from the rationale of the rule that coerced confession vitiate a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.127" offset="3099878">Thank you.</text>
