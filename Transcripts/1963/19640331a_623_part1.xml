            <label>Ms. Constance Baker Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="16.245" offset="168312">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.725" offset="190255">This case filed in January 1958 involves Atlanta, Georgia's school desegregation plan before this Court for review upon the granting of a writ of certiorari is the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.441" offset="277086">That judgment affirmed, as modified, in order of the trial court by 2-to-1 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.275" offset="312508">Judge Richard T. Rives dissenting on the original hearing and on petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.652" offset="350020">The trial court flatly refused to discard Atlanta's original court-approved plan which became effective in September 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.849" offset="406758">Now, before getting to the facts in this case, I would just like to briefly state what we believe to be the issues presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.148" offset="452002">The first issue here is whether Brown allows a School Board to reassign Negro children on a racial basis and then require them to apply for transfers to white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.746" offset="546356">Or whether Brown requires southern school authorities which established separate system, one for Negroes and one for whites to now integrate those systems into a unitary nonracial system by doing away with the dual school zone lines upon which the dual school systems are based.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.004" offset="659414">Now, the second issue presented by this case is whether the Court of Appeals' approval of a greater year plan, nine years after this Court's first Brown decision, comports with this Court's present concept of deliberate speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.286" offset="756485">The third issue involves the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.108" offset="771845">Here, it takes the form of whether Brown precludes the State from maintaining Negro and white schools, by maintaining separate staffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.689" offset="850108">The plan presently before the Court evolved from a plan approved by the trial court in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.922" offset="895039">The trial court approved the plan which provides for a greater year beginning with the 12th grade and descending a greater year thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.532" offset="941537">Under the plan, Negro children were all reassigned to Negro schools and white children were all reassigned to white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.455" offset="977168">Then the plan permitted children in the 12th and 11th grade, two grades in which the plan began because the year was skipped by the trial court awaiting action by the Georgia Legislature, children in the grades to which the plan applies are then permitted to apply for transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.594" offset="1073716">And those transfers were then considered with relation to 17 pupil assigment criteria, which in practice, as the record showed, applied only to Negroes seeking transfers to white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.952" offset="1143202">Now, this plan, which the trial court approved in 1960, continued the separate school zone lines on the elementary school level.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.194" offset="1184162">There are separate zones which related to the Negro schools and then there were separate zones which related to the system of white schools on the elementary level.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.598" offset="1221778">The trial court's plan continued the feeder system which begins when you graduate from elementary school in the 7th grade and you go to high school in the 8th grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.173" offset="1268067">The feeder system feeds three or probably four elementary schools into a previously designated high school, so that the high schools, in effect, do have zone lines consisting of the three or four elementary school zone lines which feed into their high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.572" offset="1345703">So the court-approved plan in the first instance continued that system.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.781" offset="1478510">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.367" offset="1480808">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.795" offset="1498572">Now, in 1962 after the plan had been in effect a year, we went back into the trial court and tried to get a new plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.888" offset="1542875">And the trial court refused to discard the plan which it had approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.091" offset="1575685">Then when the case got to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals modified the plan to require the application of whatever criteria were being used by the School Board at that point to all students seeking transfer, not just Negro students.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.229" offset="1656247">The evidence in the trial court showed that Negroes applied for transfer between May 1st and May 15th each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.335" offset="1692714">Then during the rest of the year, when Negroes sought transfer to Negro schools and whites to white schools, they were permitted to transfer on the other criteria or they were called informal transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.551" offset="1737540">So that the plan operated only as to Negroes seeking transfers to white schools and the Court of Appeals said, "You can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.136" offset="1767946">Whatever criteria you use have to apply the old transfers."</text>
            <text syncTime="419.710" offset="1782262">In addition, the Court of Appeals said, "You should apply with criteria of the plan when children leave the elementary school going to high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.518" offset="1829491">The plan should be applied it said, to all students new to a grade which the plan had reached."</text>
            <text syncTime="440.617" offset="1865853">And in 1964, which is this year, the plan will reach the 8th grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.844" offset="1890722">So the trial -- the Court of Appeals said, "Now, when those children move from elementary school, apply the criteria of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.172" offset="1920084">They are new."</text>
            <text syncTime="455.389" offset="1924890">And those were the major modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.716" offset="1938265">But the Court of Appeals' plan permitted the continuance of the dual zones for the elementary school level.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.083" offset="1971702">This is the foundation of the separate school system, the dual zone.</text>

            <label>Ms. Constance Baker Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="495.076" offset="2083715">Well, what happens is that Atlanta is such a large school system that it's divided into five administrative areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.326" offset="2112658">Each administrative area has a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.919" offset="2127078">And those -- that supervisor gets together with the principals in his area and they determine the lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.351" offset="2152782">Now, there's one area called "Area 1" and that is the Negro school system and it has a Negro supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.333" offset="2184652">And so he gets together with the Negro principals in the Negro elementary schools and they determine the lines for the Negro elementary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.231" offset="2220283">And these lines are related largely to the problem of capacity of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.712" offset="2238255">You see, they draw a school zone line not with -- with relation to proximity alone because you may not be able to fill the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.863" offset="2270856">So you draw the line until the school is filled with its capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.145" offset="2287992">And then when Negroes live in outlying areas, the original trial record show, they will bust in from their white area where they live into a Negro school.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.227" offset="2328325">Now, that original record isn't before the Court but the School Board appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.836" offset="2350686">And they didn't go through with their appeal but they printed the record and -- and that will -- that earlier testimony is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.779" offset="2382451">Now, the Court of Appeals also postponed indefinitely, as the trial court did, consideration of the teacher issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.925" offset="2419022">We had urged trial court to require the School Board now to come in with a plan for reassignment of teachers on a nonracial basis because as we pointed out, the Brown case talked about systems, a transition from a segregated system to a system not operated on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.986" offset="2499271">So the Brown case required disestablishment of the dual systems which meant, as we see it, not only the reassignment of pupils on some reasonable nonracial basis but the reassignment of teachers and the elimination of all other distinctions in the operation of the school system based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.964" offset="2599267">Now, in their brief in this Court, the respondent's claim that beginning in the school year 1964, there will be one criterion applied with respect to request for transfer and that is proximity.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.889" offset="2694980">However, their plan will still require students in grades 9 through 12 to apply for transfer that is under the plan, as it has operated so far, there are 150 Negro students, approximately, attending white schools -- white high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.105" offset="2791842">Now, the other Negro students who are still in Negro schools in grades 9 to 12 still have to apply for desegregation under their plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.522" offset="2841475">Their plan will apply the proximity criterion to those leaving the 7th grade and going to the 8th grade this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.429" offset="2885047">Now, that's proximity criterion, as I have pointed alone, is not sufficient if you live near a school.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.089" offset="2915767">That's not a good test because you may live in a densely populated area.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.480" offset="2941262">And you may have a school to accommodate 600 or 800 and there are 2000 in the area, so it's not proximity alone but they propose to assign children on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.791" offset="2990582">Now, in Atlanta, most of the Negro high school children live near the Negro high school.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.245" offset="4760325">But the -- but assuming that there were no problem of capacity, would a rule requiring children to go to the school nearest their homes, even though this resulted in de facto, all colored schools or all white schools in some instances, would that be constitutional in your view or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.898" offset="4846947">It'll be perm -- that rule, I think, would apply once the school system had redrawn the school zone line or whatever the basis for the segregation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.021" offset="4899506">If they then make the rule, once having disestablished a separate system, if they then make a rule that you go to the school nearest your home and it applies across the board, I think that's alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.551" offset="4945586">And of course, there will always be people who want to transfer for valid educational reasons like somebody in an academic high school may decide he can't do that work once it transferred to a vocational high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.844" offset="5014758">Now the second issue is whether the Court's approval of this 12-year plan, nine years after Brown comports with this Court's present concept of deliberate speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.904" offset="5079019">And I think it's clear that it does not in view of this Court's recent decisions in Watson and Goss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.878" offset="5126875">I think that petitioners -- respondents rather, haven't demonstrated that there are presently any administrative problems in Atlanta which prevent them from immediately desegregating all the schools in Atlanta in September, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.213" offset="5228231">Now the trial judge specifically asked them to come in with testimony to show that the plan which we had proposed to speed it up could not be speeded up and they never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.901" offset="5279013">And that's on pages 153 to 154 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.295" offset="5296567">Now if there were some administrative reasons within the categories enumerated by this Court in the second Brown decision which prevented after decade desegregation in Atlanta, they would have come in and they would have demonstrated that to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.356" offset="5368769">And in their brief here they'd only suggest any administrative reason which the Court enumerated in the second Brown case why there can't be immediate desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.605" offset="5409834">Now finally on the teacher issue, we say that the State cannot continue under Brown to maintain Negro and white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.434" offset="5449122">And the way that maintain Negro and white schools under their transfer plan such as we've had here, is by maintaining separate staffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.074" offset="5479633">Now the Superintendent testified that the policy was to assign Negroes to Negro schools and whites to white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.011" offset="5507427">Teachers apply their contracts approved by the Board but he does the assignment, the superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.897" offset="5534908">So that when a school has an all Negro staff or an all white staff, that labels that school as a Negro school or white school as much as they had put a sign over the door saying Negro and white.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.263" offset="5596453">Now they claimed they've eliminated all labels from their records but this is a far more effective label in the judgment on the community than a label in a -- a record book because everybody knows that that separate system means Negro school, white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.167" offset="5684015">Now we urge this Court to reverse the judgment below and to remand this case with direction to reassign all students in Atlanta in 1964 pursuant to nonracial capacity related school zone lines that each elementary and high school reassign all teachers and assign all future teachers on the basis of qualification and need and without regard to race and remand it with directions through the District Court to enjoin any other distinction in the operation of the school system based wholly on race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.076" offset="5835630">I'd like to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.338" offset="5880769">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.307" offset="5920580">This is the fourth case that this Court has reviewed involving school desegregation since its opinion in the Brown cases in 1954 and 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.522" offset="5981497">That includes the Prince Edward case which was argued yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.128" offset="6003858">The United States has participated in each of these cases as amicus, not only because of the interest of the United States in the constitutional rights of the millions of its citizens, but also because of its interest on the effect on the education of millions of children in at least 11 of our states from the manner and speed with which the Brown decisions are implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.880" offset="6146905">This is the -- the first of the four cases that presents the Court directly with an opportunity to review the application by School Boards and the lower courts of the deliberate speed concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.032" offset="6215450">The standards of that concept are contained in a very few sentences in the Brown case, Cooper against Aaron, Goss and Watson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.437" offset="6261112">The issue is whether those standards were applied by the court below and by the Atlanta School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.457" offset="6297161">I think that it is relevant in considering that question to look at the implementation of the Brown decisions elsewhere as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.862" offset="6346794">First in terms of the general statistics in the 11 states and secondly, with the respect to the facts showing experience in particular, other cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.170" offset="6404054">The general statistics do not show widespread compliance as yet with the Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.761" offset="6434461">In the 11 states of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, 82% of the school districts are still segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.391" offset="6500916">There are 30,000 as of this last fall, Negro children going to school with white children in these States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.732" offset="6542294">That's out of a total of three and a half million white children and about a million Negro children, who are technically going to the schools in desegregated districts that is districts where some Negro children are going with white children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.581" offset="6737690">The figure on the number of white children going in -- to school in school districts where there are some Negro children and some white schools is three and a half million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.528" offset="6785442">But how many of those are going to schools in which there are Negro children also attending on is not the statistics I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.342" offset="6816789">In those same districts, there are a million Negro children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.677" offset="6834030">This is out of a total school population in this area of about almost 3 million Negro children and almost 8 million white children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.541" offset="6881573">The percentage of Negro children going to school with white children is a little over 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.976" offset="6919293">In part, these statistics simply show no movement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.289" offset="6944580">But in part and I think this is true as to the 30,000 children that are going to schools with white children, 30,000 Negro children were actually going to schools with white children in desegregated school districts which contained a total of over a million Negro children, that they show so many facts of the application by the School Boards and the District Courts of the deliberate speed concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.045" offset="7079581">That the experience in some cities has been that large school districts can desegregate rapidly and that delay is not necessary or even helpful once the start is made at least as an administrative matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.121" offset="7159829">Now one example of that is here in Washington which was desegregated all at once in 1954 by complete rezoning of a dual school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.972" offset="7207267">That was done of course in the city with a large Negro population and it was done just a year after the restaurants in the cities were desegregated following this Court's decision in Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.975" offset="7263274">In Baltimore, it was done in all one year in 1954 that all pupils in the entering school in the first year of elementary school or the first -- or the first year of secondary school, being admitted to the schools of their choice and all other children that were already in the school system being permitted to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.796" offset="7366510">The Baltimore Board considered and rejected gradual desegregation approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.157" offset="7400051">In Louisville, Kentucky, another large city was desegregation was achieved in one year in 1956, all levels of education in the city were redistricted and transfers were permitted thereafter on the grounds of space, convenience, and individual preferences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.314" offset="7696593">These are large cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.615" offset="7701817">They did have completely segregated school districts when they started, when they first look at the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.411" offset="7728985">The one thing that the Brown decision in Cooper against Aaron -- Cooper against Aaron in all decisions in -- in this field have ruled out as a factor of delay is disagreement with the Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.180" offset="7792097">And so the emphasis is on administrative problems, administrative problems in rezoning, transportation, the assignment of personnel and that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.180" offset="7832116">Those were the factors that Brown specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.327" offset="7844655">It -- it seemed to me, Mr. Justice Stewart that the experience in these large cities has some bearing, some relevancy at least on -- on the question of whether administrative problems of that sort require a plan which takes until as Senator Motley pointed out 1977 fall to implement completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.009" offset="7959385">The -- the manner in which this was achieved in St. Louis was in three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.125" offset="7999822">In September 1954, February 1955 and September 1955, involving in a step-by-step plan, the junior college and teacher college, the first time and high schools accept the technical ones the second time and the technical high schools and the elementary schools in the third stage and this again, involved complete rezoning and the creation of new mandatory attendance districts with transfers to deal with the problems of overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.795" offset="8154572">There's also been progress in the cities where there have been severe problems to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.390" offset="8188949">New Orleans, they're at now 350 Negro children attending 27 schools, Norfolk, 347 in 12 schools, where the schools were closed at first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.619" offset="8241821">Little Rock, the School Board announced a complete desegregation this fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.813" offset="8266585">Nashville, the first seven grades have been desegregated with 773 Negro children now in white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.121" offset="8303888">As I've said, the relevance of these statistics seems to me to show that urban desegregation as an administrative problem which is what Brown talked about can be accomplished rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.248" offset="8384345">And of course, the Watson and the Goss case suggest in any event that the passage of time since the Brown decisions in -- in itself has altered the situation because the constitutional doctrines are -- are in effect, are no longer novel, they shouldn't be expected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.344" offset="8688724">Some of these statistics that I have referred to show just no movement, it's as if we had to sue every taxpayer to make him pay his taxes or no corporation obeyed the Sherman Act until you brought a suit against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.233" offset="8752253">That isn't the problem in this case however, Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.412" offset="8768972">In this case, Atlanta is under a court order and it's a question of what the court order should be in a city which is already started, which has shown a willingness in fact a determination at first against the good deal of opposition to obey the court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.096" offset="8839711">And that, I think the question is whether the plan that in Atlanta is leading with deliberate speed to what is required by Brown which is an admission of all pupils into a racially non-segregated system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.409" offset="8912959">So I -- I think the other problem, Mr. Justice Goldberg, in a -- in a sense can't be dealt with by this Court, has to be dealt with in some other fashion or its legislation now before Congress which -- which would -- would reach it to some extent, but it isn't -- it -- it isn't a question of what an order -- this order against Atlanta should say if there's no movement at all in a school district that is not a problem that this Court can deal with and the order it corrects against the Atlanta schools district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.284" offset="9064469">In our opinion, the Atlanta plan does not comply with the requirements of the Brown decision after this experience in Atlanta and this experience in the contract in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.378" offset="9132910">And that it's convenient for me talking about this to separate the problem in the high schools from the problem in the elementary schools system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.495" offset="9181393">As Justice Stewart mentioned, there is no junior high school system so that the high schools in Atlanta start with the 8th grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.356" offset="9220786">So first as to the high school system, it is our view that the plan does not conform to the constitutional requirement in the high schools starting this fall despite the fact that some Negro children will be going to school with white in all grades starting this fall including the 8th grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.989" offset="9331336">And the reason for that is that in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades this fall, the initial assignment will still be on a racial basis being a continuation of the assignment from this year and only the 8th grade will be desegregated and what we view as a constitutional manner with the initial race -- initial assignment being totally without regard to race.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.809" offset="9534568">But I -- I think that the school system in Atlanta, the high school system in Atlanta is going to have to be reorganized, rezoned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2483.231" offset="10036328">But the Constitution doesn't require them to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.426" offset="10049076">All the school districts take into account the residential area and the number of people that lives in -- live in it in a population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.266" offset="10084394">They -- they deal with that either by changing the school district or permitting a free transfer plan or some other fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.294" offset="10124518">A school board in Atlanta has shown itself able to deal with these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.346" offset="10152730">I'm sure it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.420" offset="10169031">The second way in which we believe that the Atlanta plan is unacceptable under the requirements of the Brown decision now, is in the weight of desegregation in the elementary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.780" offset="10250533">We think that the District Court erred when he refused to reexamine the speed of -- desegregation that's envisaged by the plan and that he erred in fair -- failing to require the School Board to prove what administrative problems if any, prevented a -- an acceleration of desegregation in the elementary schools either to the extent that was requested by the plaintiffs which is to cut it down to two years or even to do it all at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.446" offset="10409148">The third mistake that we believe the courts below made, was in refusing to order the School Board to adopt any plan at all with respect to the integration of faculty and particularly as to that point I think with that -- with respect to the integration of the faculty in the high schools which will otherwise be completely desegregated in the 8th grade and we believe also in -- it should be required in the remaining grades this fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.341" offset="10568704">As to the pupil assignment in the high schools, there's no dispute but that that is the desegregation that has taken place in the high schools, has been by a transferred system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.686" offset="10646131">The initial assignment of pupils under the high schools has been by a feeder system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.617" offset="10669850">And under that system, since the lower grades are completely segregated still, all Negro students automatically came out of the 7th grade, went into the 8th grade into five Negro high schools except to these Negro high schools by everyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.602" offset="11517785">Now in the last couple of years, there's been litigation in all four Circuits that were mainly concerned with this, in the Fifth Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, the 8th Circuit and the Sixth Circuit and the -- all of those Circuits have held and had come up and they have held that the elimination of dual school systems of this overlapping assignment plans that you referred to earlier are -- is unnecessary part of compliance with Brown.</text>

            <text syncTime="3921.198" offset="15788178">In arguing this case, I find myself in the role of a lawyer who tries his own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.133" offset="15819943">This came about by reason of the fact that when this suit was initially filed, I was a member of the Atlanta Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.610" offset="15849827">I am no longer a member of that Board but its attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.569" offset="15869680">And I trust that in appearing in this dual capacity that I will not run afoul of the (Inaudible) that a man who represents himself in Court has a full four o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.767" offset="15914402">At the threshold of my argument, I would like to try to explain what the Atlanta plan is and I mean by that, what the Atlanta plan is in 1964, now and in September of 1964 and not what the plan was in 1961, in September, when Atlanta started on the desegregation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.412" offset="16029027">But gentlemen, this is a moving thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.273" offset="16040417">It's an evolutionary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.943" offset="16051179">Because as we understand the rulings of this Court and other courts, you allow us a pupil assignment plan as a vehicle to go from a totally desegregated system since 1874 when our system was found to an integrated or desegregated system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.348" offset="16152743">And we view that vehicle as something that you allowed us to use, not as a roadblock, but to smooth the way along and they say one picture is worth 10,000 words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.007" offset="16203421">And I saw this cartoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.463" offset="16213243">It showed a road and there were some bumps in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.883" offset="16226931">And they showed a steamroller and on the road was desegregation, the Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.228" offset="16248247">And on the steamroller was pupil assignment plans and it showed the southern city with a steamroller as a roadblock across the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.771" offset="16286490">We've tried to use that vehicle to smooth out some rough spots and to achieve an end which we know we must achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.962" offset="16327241">In this connection, it had been stated that the Atlanta plan was based upon the plan considered in Birmingham, the Shuttlesworth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.800" offset="16366529">And even in itself, this statement is misleading for the Atlanta plan is initially instituted was almost verbatim, copied from the Birmingham plan which was the only plan that at that time that had received the approval of this Court even in a preliminary way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.653" offset="16478020">But as this plan has devolved, as we began with this plan of Shuttlesworth, including all its various criteria, many of these criteria and many of the things contained in that plan, were voluntarily abandoned by the Atlanta School Board as serving no useful purpose and serving no educational purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.462" offset="16577181">Gentlemen at one time, as a placebo or sugar pill, to make some of these acceptable to our community, there were many things in the plan such a many parents requested that we put in the plan and have the Court approved it, the right to segregate by sexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.919" offset="16651055">Let the girls go to one school and the boys to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.026" offset="16663489">It's never been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.041" offset="16667564">It's not contemplated to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.232" offset="16676342">It's not even a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.501" offset="16685328">But many of these criteria are hurdles that were there, were put there following what we thought Shuttlesworth had said that these criteria could be used as a transfer complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.104" offset="16747813">Now during the first year, the record shows that only three of the criteria we use, we did the first year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.488" offset="16789295">I will admit unconstitutionally test all of the applicants for transfer and that application on his test must make a score which would equal the average of the grade to which he sought transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.584" offset="16857736">And it was pointed out to us that you have some Negroes do it, though not as well qualified and you also have some white students who possibly wouldn't pass that test.</text>

            <text syncTime="4235.656" offset="17046026">We did away with that special test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.740" offset="17058356">Judge Rives even on his -- in his dissenting opinion, said that we gave the personality test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.033" offset="17087509">We did give a personality test the first year of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.398" offset="17108929">Now if it please the Court, that test was to try to make the Atlanta plan work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.056" offset="17135574">He was to bring these kids in and tell them, "Look, here's what's expected of you.</text>

            <text syncTime="4265.042" offset="17163577">And this plan must work because this community devoutly wanted this plan to work."</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.785" offset="17190536">Now, let me say this that generally speaking at Atlanians and Georgians did not want to start on a program of desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.098" offset="17247796">But above that desire was a desire to be law abiding and two, under no circumstances with my community ever abandon public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.073" offset="17303698">Our few section that of our community, for what was known as the pupil tuition grants acts, as we thought unconstitutional and not serving any useful purpose to our community and quite expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.925" offset="17367124">Now in 1962, we infringed, in 1963, we went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.754" offset="17398366">No special tests were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.804" offset="17406621">No personality tests were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.033" offset="17419473">But the tests that were normally and routinely given in the schools was still greater and those who did not meet the average of the medium of the class to which they saw transfer, were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.896" offset="17470986">Judge Bell's opinion came out and by the way, I think possibly had Judge Bell reversed that case, we might not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.690" offset="17518111">But in essence, he pointed out to us what our deficiencies were and even on the 63 assignments, all those who had in the sense been tested out or called back in and this criteria was used and this only, do you still want to transfer?</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.893" offset="17598986">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.012" offset="17603375">Well now, you must live closer to the school to which you seek transfer, then the school from which you came, which we think is -- is constitutionally acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.298" offset="17644544">Now, we exa -- reexamined all of these pending transfers and granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.002" offset="17687385">Atlanta points with pride to these accomplishments, but in reply, our opponents say that we still operate a dual or biracial system of schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.524" offset="17745481">And that our plan will never accomplish complete desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.435" offset="17765125">In addition, they say that in terms of results, we promised an eagle and produced only tomcat.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.989" offset="17803368">That after three full years, under this Atlanta plan that some 150 Negro students are now attending formally all white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.141" offset="17855927">Now, viewed in terms of numbers, this argument is a powerful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.622" offset="17881840">Even allowing for the factors of geography and residential patterns which the lower courts recognized taken in prospective however, any argument based on numbers alone is -- is an argument that has got to be -- you've got to take into consideration when you're talking about numbers, the overall plan and it's all like the story of a man who hired an itinerate mathematician to work for him, told him he would pay him one cent a day and double it each day thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.169" offset="18044008">And if you recall that story, the -- on the 10th day, he owed him $10.23 I think, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.790" offset="18078490">At the end of 30 days, the 30th day it was $5 million and some $23 million or $24 million over the whole 30-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.786" offset="18122480">Now, we bring that story to illustrate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.457" offset="18141184">We don't propose to take 30 years to desegregate the Atlanta system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.509" offset="18165426">We don't propose to do it tomorrow if we allowed gradualism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.673" offset="18194056">But we do want to show that Atlanta plan and in the mean voluntarily is in motion and has moved forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="4566.823" offset="18370644">I would say this that they reassigned 100,000 pupils overnight incidentally, would create many problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.930" offset="18399065">Many problems nothing to do with race but you would disrupt neighborhood patterns, you would disrupt transportation patterns, extracurricular activities and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.436" offset="18433128">But I think when -- let me say here if I may, what is the Atlanta plan today?</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.389" offset="18460923">Now, for and what the Atlanta has done voluntarily, following what Atlanta learned from other District Court and Circuit Court cases and your various rulings and followed after the rather extensive surgery in Judge Bell's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.795" offset="18534588">Here's what the Atlanta plan is in 1964, it's first, choice, second, space, third, proximity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.981" offset="18587251">Now, let me explain that if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.081" offset="18599685">Traditionally, Atlanta has been what we call an open city and the reason for that was that boys all and girls all over the city went primarily to Boys High School, which was downtown and Girls High School, which was downtown, and they came from all over the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.416" offset="18669066">And at 2 or 3 o'clock when they went home to (Inaudible) the community because everything merged through the center of town, transportation-wise, so we went back to a community high school and we took our old junior highs and converted them to high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.075" offset="18723715">Now, that policy of children going pretty much where they want to has still remained in the Atlanta system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.162" offset="18764048">Normally and ordinarily, children go to the school nearest to their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.675" offset="18782124">So we would like if we may, be permitted to do so because we think that's best by our community to let children, pretty much have and their parents a choice of where they go to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.237" offset="18832280">Now, you would recognize immediately that administratively, if they all decided to go to the same school, and some schools are just an old school, some a little bit of area than others and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.920" offset="18887032">That the administrator and you've recognized it all through your writings that the local School Board has to run the school system, that the local administrator, the superintendent then, would have to use some way of determining whether that who's -- shall go to the school if more apply for the school than we have facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.803" offset="18970624">So then you would use proximity as a limiting factor there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.567" offset="18993612">That is three children apply for the same seat in the school room, in the same building.Now, how do you go and determine which gets the seat?</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.471" offset="19033213">Well, the one that lived nearest to the schoolhouse.</text>

            <text syncTime="4744.546" offset="19081592">Now, as far as the plan is concerned, one of the complaints of the petitioners is, you come down 12, 11, 10, 9, you're down to 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.785" offset="19142510">Nine, eight, where the feed of system takes hold, the Court has told you and this was part of the surgery that you must now reassign those children that go -- formally went -- Negro high -- Negro -- formally all -- Negro all elementary to Negro high, formal white to white high.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.511" offset="19217429">Now that you must reassign these children with an evenhanded, in an evenhanded manner, without regard to race and that we are going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.529" offset="19257448">And on that basis, the child can go to the high school of his choice leaving the 7th grade, going to the 8th grade with these factors that I've enumerated, taken in proximity and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.757" offset="19310425">Now, that does away certainly with the 8th grade with the duel system, but you say, what about the poor kid in 9, 10, 11 and 12, who didn't make it here on that magic date and get an original assignment or reassignment?</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.471" offset="19385240">Well, it's this simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.244" offset="19396315">Since Judge Bell's surgery, the difference between a transfer and assignment in Atlanta is tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.326" offset="19432678">Now, let me illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.422" offset="19445112">Assume a colored child lives directly across from a formerly white high school and he's in this 9th grade we're talking about, he can get there simply by he and his parents going across the street and going through the ordinary process that any child goes through, to be admitted to a school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.262" offset="19544377">We have pre-registration as you do here and everywhere, go there and let it be known that he wants to go there and it will be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.006" offset="19579382">In other words, since Judge Bell's opinion, we believe that all that is left of the Atlanta plan is a greater year from seven down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.131" offset="19639881">Now, it is true, if they charge us with a biracial system there, that is true, but we thought Shuttlesworth -- Shuttlesworth approved that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.031" offset="19687528">That is, you fire the gun on opening day, each went back to the schools where they formally attended with a right to transfer out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.797" offset="19730578">Now, in most of those cases you read, if it please the Court, you will find that there are method of getting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.700" offset="19758164">They had to jump a lot of hurdles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.096" offset="19767777">Did Judge Wright said in the Bush case, they had to stand muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.754" offset="19782405">Some of the judges said, they had to ask for something that'd already been granted to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.799" offset="19802572">Now, we've tried to give a free system of transfers, because in 1963, after Judge Bell's opinion came down, we called in each one of the applicants, asked them if they wanted to be transferred and all who lived nearer to the formally white school who still wanted to go there, were transferred.</text>
