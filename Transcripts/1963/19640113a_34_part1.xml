            <text syncTime="25.473" offset="205302">On June 29, 1959 the respondent who was the Virginia State Bar instituted an equity proceeding in the Chancery Court of the City of Richmond against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.104" offset="255770">It alleged among other things that the Brotherhood the petitioner maintained a Legal Aid Department and while collecting certain information for itself it solicited business for legal counsel and it detailed how it did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.358" offset="324838">It said that large members were injured the local secretary of the lodge reported to the Legal Aid Department which we now call Legal -- Department of Legal Counsel and in turn an investigator would go out and secure certain information and also recommend Legal Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.111" offset="411773">It also alleged that the claims handled by the Legal Counsel were handled on a contingent fixed-fee basis by the Brotherhood and followed that Legal Counsel supported and maintained the Department of Legal Aid, which is Department of Legal Counsel now.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.989" offset="491290">The Brotherhood accrued the Bill of Complaint and said that prior to 08/01/59 which was the decision of the Illinois case it did set the fee of Legal Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.968" offset="559208">Legal Counsel did support the Department of Legal Counsel which was, at one time, legal aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.680" offset="594108">They said however, in their answer and evidence showed that three months before this suit was instituted, and this is the words we used, “The Brotherhood no longer sets the fee to be charged by Legal Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.866" offset="654817">The Brotherhood did not share in the direct or indirect of the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.127" offset="671848">The Brotherhood's Counsel no longer contributes to the support the Legal Aid Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.890" offset="694941">Now, the Brotherhood in its answer and also by written motion raised the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.125" offset="723884">They said they had a legal right to inform its member generally and specifically that they should employ a Legal Counsel where they were injured and they suggested a counsel who is capable of handling it, who is a legal aid.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.390" offset="1880900">Now, coming back to the history of this case, the first case, I'd like to go back to the reasons for the extension and I think the reasons are very sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.765" offset="1918412">The Brotherhood found that a large number of its members were injured and killed each year because they worked in hazardous business.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.170" offset="1956028">They found that railroads had some unscrupulous claim agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.754" offset="1974418">They further found that their average lawyer knew nothing to whirl about FELA cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.936" offset="1999078">I'll give an example in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.361" offset="2008795">It also found that the rules of certain railroads prohibited members from talking to any outsider or employing a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.007" offset="2043382">They fired them if they employed a lawyer or if they talked to anybody on the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.233" offset="2060309">Fortunately, the railroad Brotherhood the plaintiff or petitioner here got the FELA Section 60 amended so that it made it unlawful for railroad to fire a man talking to the outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.459" offset="2109210">Now, Mr. Lush who is general manager here for a number of years in this Legal Aid Department, he gives two examples and I'd like to give his example.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.800" offset="2146617">He gives more but I'll give two.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.279" offset="2156440">He said that the Safety Appliance Act required railroads to have a coupler which would couple or uncouple automatically and he said, “Sometimes, the member,” and he gave a specific example on page 915 to 937.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.431" offset="2221119">He said, "This man went into jiggle down the block and lost his arm."</text>
            <text syncTime="534.147" offset="2239927">The claim agent of the railroad came around and asked him, "Was the coupler broken?"</text>
            <text syncTime="539.870" offset="2262810">He said “No."</text>
            <text syncTime="541.648" offset="2269915">Then when he wrote up his statement he said, "The coupler was not defective."</text>
            <text syncTime="546.163" offset="2287992">He said, “Our member, as an average railroad man, cannot differentiate between broken and a defective coupler.”</text>
            <text syncTime="553.578" offset="2317667">He gave two other very astounding examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.008" offset="2331355">He said, "An inexperienced lawyer in FELA cases did this to their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.602" offset="2353821">The member lost 20 years seniority because the lawyer was inexperienced.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.968" offset="2375241">Another one lost 25 years of seniority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="571.200" offset="2388198">And he goes on and gives other examples.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.804" offset="2510555">The first important case to come to an appellate court was Ryan versus the Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.545" offset="2537514">Mr. Ryan, a distinguished Chicago lawyer, was referred a case by the Brotherhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.512" offset="2561442">He sent a notice of lien in and the Pennsylvania Railroad settled behind his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.346" offset="2584743">Mr. Ryan brought a lawsuit on that lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.807" offset="2598640">The Pennsylvania Railroad defended on the ground that he had secured the case for solicitation and it was against public policy to sue on a contract that was -- violated public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.405" offset="2652975">The court said and made a clear distinction in that case between the referral by -- made by the Brotherhood and regional and unlawful solicitation that court further said that the plan was alright and they put great emphasis on the plan because it served a worthy purpose and the lawyer who said that Mr. Ryan was the beneficiary of unethical conduct, they said he should not have made that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.007" offset="2759450">It's an unworthy distinction the lawyer made.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.573" offset="2769690">The next case that came before the Court in 1933, it was the Cleveland Bar in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.275" offset="2800515">They brought a disciplinary action against one of the Legal Counsel, Judge Newcomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.868" offset="2822875">The Court refused to enjoin Judge Newcomer but did reprimand him.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.295" offset="2844505">It is a two-to-one decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.585" offset="2853700">The decision had a dissent and that was Justice Levi.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.064" offset="2871672">Justice Levi had said it is not claimed that the -- by the Cleveland Bar that this was an ordinary harmless case and it was a different case and he said, “Even the members of Rule 28 -- the committees if there is a conflict of opinion, then the Supreme Court of Ohio should revise Rule 28."</text>
            <text syncTime="712.986" offset="2955368">The next case was a California case, Hildebrand.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.229" offset="3476250">Now the Court said, "We couldn't do these things and we say we are not doing it."</text>
            <text syncTime="847.005" offset="3491401">The court says there's no financial connection whatsoever.</text>
