            <text syncTime="33.772" offset="238425">This is an appeal from a judgment, ordering the destruction by burning or otherwise of 1715 books on the ground that they're allegedly obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.059" offset="299656">The action was instituted by Mr. Ferguson, the Attorney General, on July 25th 1961 after he had read seven Nightstand Books.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.690" offset="346154">Having read these seven books, he decided read 59 other Nightstand books or 59 and all Nightstand books were obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.724" offset="378232">He filed an information, on belief only, asking for a search warrant for the seizure and the burning of the 59 Nightstand books.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.016" offset="427447">The information was duly filed in Geary County.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.542" offset="445524">The seven books that Mr. Ferguson had read were given to Judge Fletcher to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.587" offset="465690">These were appropriately underlined and noted for their sexual passages.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.206" offset="488155">The books were taken to Judge Fletcher's home at 5 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.041" offset="507486">Judge Fletcher held an ex parte hearing at 8 o'clock or 8:30 at the Court House.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.114" offset="531832">At this hearing, he previewed one or more books as the record states, decided that the seven books were probably obscene and that therefore, the other 59 books or the other 52 books were also probably obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.191" offset="596093">He, therefore, ordered the Sheriff to seize all copies of these 59 books that he could find that the P-K News Company and the Sheriff appropriately went out with the warrant, seized 31 different titles, constituting the 1715 books, left the warrant with the notice of hearing at the P-K News Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.913" offset="4826990">Coming back to the proceedings that we had on the merits so called, whether these 31 books were or were not obscene, after we demurred to the evidence at the close of the government's case the defendants did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.495" offset="4897311">First of all we introduced 31 other books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.176" offset="4912044">We said, you have 31 books, we will put on 31, 29 of these other books were in the library in Junction City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.982" offset="4943287">Two, the librarian said, she would have liked to buy them, but they were too expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.683" offset="4962095">In addition, we called three persons who have qualified as experts, experts in the sense that they read a great deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.473" offset="4993233">They said that they were familiar with the literature that generally circulates in America and in Junction City particularly and that they were able to state affirmatively that talking about language first, the so called four letter words while they were entirely absent in the 31 books before Your Honors now, they were very prevalent in books that were to be found in hardcover nationally circulated such as ‘Lady Chatterley's Lover,' such as Tropic of Cancer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.324" offset="5116635">Themes such as the sexual relationships between an adult man 44, and a 14 year old girl would be found in books like ‘Lolita'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.634" offset="5161880">From all of this, the three experts, comparing these 31 books and the 31 books that had been introduced as being in the library and generally circulating, the experts said that the 31 books here did not go beyond customary limits of candor and the language used, they were calmer, they were muted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.880" offset="5234918">In the kinds of sexual scenes that were depicted, these were muted, compared to Lady Chatterley's Lover and the other books that were introduced, that in the variety of situations, these books did not go beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.983" offset="5287267">In total, the three experts said that assuming the test of obscenity is, do these books go beyond other books which are generally circulating, the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.247" offset="5332407">Thereafter, Judge Fletcher wrote his opinion and he said, well, the big difference between these 31 paperback books and the 31 books that were introduced by the defendants is this, that in the paperback books, in the books before the court, the dominant thing of the books was sex with plot scenes of servings, whereas in Lady Chatterley's Lover and the other books, the dominant theme was not sex, they had a plot independently and sex was merely subservient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.771" offset="5458422">In that way, he said there was a distinction and then he applied this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.104" offset="5471796">He said, if he found that the books had the purpose and effect and defect of inciting sexual desires, on the average person in this community -- this community was what he used, then the book was not protected by the First Amendment and it could be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.214" offset="5552253">Kansas Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.325" offset="5564688">Kansas Supreme Court used a variety of tests in determining that these books were obscene?</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.278" offset="5588511">First of all, they went to the statute, and the statute is different from the test that was used by Judge Fletcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.359" offset="5612857">Then, the Supreme Court approved of Judge Fletcher's test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.706" offset="5626232">Then the court said, by looking at the excerpts, because they apparently hadn't read the 31 books, looking at the excerpts of the books that were in the back of Mr. Ferguson's brief, they checked it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.475" offset="5669282">The page references were correct and based upon that these books surely came within the Roth Alberts' test also and finally to make it good measure, they said any offenders, hardcore pornography is bad by any test we know, including the test that was promulgated by the Wit, Irvin S. Cobb who said, that his test of obscenity was this "If the depth of the dirt exceeded the breadth of the wit, then a work was obscene.”</text>
