            <text syncTime="24.188" offset="200077">And may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.538" offset="205511">Before I get into my principal point, which will be that it was improper for the Court of Appeals to invoke its mandamus power in this case for the reason that -- that there was a remedy available under the Interlocutory Appeals Act and the plaintiffs, the respondents here, failed to seek relief under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.347" offset="320763">And for the further reason that the district judge, in passing on this transfer motion, in no way act that in excess of his statutory prescribed jurisdiction and for that reason, his decision on the transfer motion was not a controllable by mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.161" offset="388054">Before I reach those reasons with respect to my main point, I would like to advert to the question the Court was exploring yesterday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.151" offset="443956">That is the question as to whether, first, there will any substantial prejudice resulting to the plaintiffs as the result of the transfer of this case from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts and whether or not that prejudice effect, if the contingency of prejudice materializes whether that factor by itself constitutes the type of abusive discretion that should've precluded the district judge from effecting the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.703" offset="594213">I would like to say with respect to that point preliminarily that so far as the Government, so far as the United States is concerned, that problem has no -- no relevance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.307" offset="640606">The Unites States is exposed to liability for compensatory damages irrespective of any state statutory ceiling on wrongful-death actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.087" offset="703718">Under the Tort Claims Act, this Court in the Massachusetts' Bonding case held that the federal government cannot avail itself of the limits of liability under the Massachusetts' law even with respect to a death occurring in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.839" offset="766725">And the district judge realized this and -- and noted this in his opinion, and noted that that if there ever should be ultimate liability adjudicated as against the Unites States, the United States, whether the case is tried in Pennsylvania or in Massachusetts and irrespective of whether or not the Pennsylvania Courts accept or reject Kilberg, the potential liability of the United States is -- is unlimited.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.257" offset="1612361">The Court will remember that this was somewhat unusual accident, the basic claim of negligence is against all of the defendants is that the engines on this Lockheed were negligently designed so that they were conducive to bird ingestion and that the United States Government somehow should've cleared the airways of -- of birds before the plane took off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.197" offset="9396120">Good morning Your Honors and with permission of the Court as Your Honors know, I am here on behalf of the respondent plaintiffs to ask Your Honors to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals which held in effect that these actions maybe tried in Philadelphia where they were commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.631" offset="9473860">The precise question of law to be decided in this case as I see it is whether or not a District Court Judge has the power as a matter of law to transfer an action to another District Court in which it could not have been commenced because of lack of capacity of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.444" offset="9561109">We advance to Your Honors three reasons why this question should be answered in the negative and the decision of the Court of Appeals affirmed, they are these - First, the decision of the Court of Appeals was in accordance with the express intent of Congress as construed by prior decisions of this and other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.770" offset="9650448">Secondly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is in accordance with the policy of the states and the federal government as embodied in the rules of civil -- Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.405" offset="9696946">And thirdly, that decision should be affirmed because to reverse it would be to work grave prejudice to the substantive rights of these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.629" offset="9737906">Now, if Your Honors will permit me before referring to those arguments in detail, I would like to make a brief reference to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.193" offset="9772178">In all of these cases, we have as plaintiffs, fiduciaries who lived in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.767" offset="9810422">Each one of them was appointed fiduciary by an Orphans Court in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.453" offset="9837171">Each one of them represents a decedent who also lived in Pennsylvania and whose estate will be administered under the laws of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.587" offset="9873742">Each one of those decedents was a resident of Pennsylvania and started on this journey from Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.374" offset="9904880">Now, if I may allude for one moment to -- a particular one of these cases, the case of Mrs. Frankenfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.816" offset="9934660">She is typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.236" offset="9940302">She happened to be a client of mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.816" offset="9946676">She came to me under these circumstances and asked me to take her case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.439" offset="9965171">I agreed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.065" offset="9971649">I recommended that suit be commenced in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania because I learned that each of the defendants involved -- each of the defendants involved that I thought she had an action against did business in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.809" offset="10046568">She agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.216" offset="10052211">That was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.299" offset="10060570">Now, at this point in a small parenthesis, I would like to submit to Your Honors, I do not think it's fair to describe that conduct as forum-shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.388" offset="10104874">That was a natural and normal thing for a -- a Pennsylvania fiduciary to do with respect to suits against the corporate defendants doing business in Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="2734.385" offset="11040893">Rule 17 (b) as these defendants would have argued in Massachusetts says that the capacity to sue shall -- I'm just quoting only that much of it as it applies to our case, capacity to sue shall be determined by the law of the court of the state in which the court sits."</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.367" offset="11108812">Therefore, the Massachusetts district court judge would have looked to the law of Massachusetts under that rule to determine whether or not we had capacity to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.312" offset="11144652">We had not qualified, it never -- there was no reason for us to qualify as ancillary administrators up there and the law of Massachusetts is very clear that a foreign fiduciary may not bring an action in the State of Massachusetts and if he does his action without a qualification up there, if he does, his action should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.290" offset="11224482">So there is no doubt about what these cases could not have been brought in Massachusetts and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.233" offset="11256351">Our opponents, the Government concedes that they would have had that defense in Massachusetts, but they -- but all of the defendants attempt to circumvent that conclusion by saying, "Well, if we had tried, we could've qualified up there."</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.708" offset="11318209">Now, as a matter of fact if Your Honors please, qualification of an ancillary administrator in Massachusetts requires much more than a ministerial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.000" offset="11359378">It requires application to the probate court in Massachusetts which will -- after due notice of 30 or 15 days, depending upon whether it's a -- a -- an executor or an administrator which is applying, it requires application to the Court which will consider the appointment of the ancillary administrator and will normally follow a certain list of priorities which are -- in -- in making these appointments which are rather strictly followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.352" offset="11472750">The list of priorities in Massachusetts is, first, the widow or the husband; secondly, next of kin, thirdly, creditors, fourth, the public administrator. Some of our plaintiffs do not come within any of those categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.172" offset="11536071">In any event, cases cited in our brief show you that the Massachusetts court in this situation does not always appoint those who are otherwise ostensibly qualified, but appointment -- ancillary appointment in Massachusetts is a matter addressed of the discretion of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.151" offset="11595943">So I say to Your Honors and our brief will elaborate this, there is very grave doubt whether or not -- even if we had applied, we would've qualified in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.155" offset="11635963">In addition to that fact Your Honor, we had no -- we never -- there was no reason for us to try, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.170" offset="11668041">And if one more went -- before I get to that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.063" offset="11675669">In -- in addition to the facts that I've just indicated, these suits which we’re now considering were commenced with -- some of them were commenced with only a few weeks of the expiration of the 1-year-statute limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.730" offset="11730317">One of them was commenced on the very last day that suit could've been commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.331" offset="11748707">Now, in Massachusetts, we are required by law to advertise our application for letters of -- ancillary letters up there for either 15 or 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.716" offset="11786219">So that there wasn't time to do the things required up there before the statue of limitations expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.450" offset="11809207">But in any event, Your Honors have told us clearly in the case of Hoffman versus Blaski that the test as to whether or not a -- an action could've been brought in the transferee district is not to be applied as of the time of transfer -- the application for transfer, but rather the test is to be applied as of the time the suit is commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.503" offset="11905337">That was the square holding in Hoffman versus Blaski as Your Honors will recall and this is detailed in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.044" offset="11931564">So the only proper test in this case is, were these plaintiffs qualified to bring this action in Massachusetts as of the day they commenced them in Pennsylvania and there is no room for argument, they were not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.582" offset="13873716">They say, consider the consequences this would have on the administration of the federal courts because it would mean that fiduciary cases could not be transferred under 1404 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.065" offset="13919587">I think if we're going to look at the considerations that they suggest, the practical results which will follow from an affirmance of this decision, we have to look at them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.006" offset="13955427">And I think the first consequence we ought to look to is the consequence to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.971" offset="13979251">This is not -- this is not a -- a multiple litigation as far as Mrs. Frankenfield is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.973" offset="14007254">She has one case and to her, this is a single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.672" offset="14030033">As a fiduciary, it's far easier and far cheaper for her to bring the suit in the district where the defendants did business with her rather than to go up some place up to Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.958" offset="14071202">And in that connection Your Honors may recall, this is one of the shortest plane distance you could get.</text>

            <text syncTime="3574.035" offset="14399509">And he said, "That shows that it's more convenient for the witnesses that this case be tried in Boston."</text>

            <text syncTime="3682.422" offset="14833037">Here's the situation on that aspect of the case as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.729" offset="14858324">As Your Honors know, under Klaxon versus Stentor, a District Court must apply the conflicts rule of the state in which it sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.744" offset="14898343">Now, in Massachusetts as you know, there's a limitation of damages in this action of $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.374" offset="14920913">In Pennsylvania there is no such limitation and there is very strong constitutional -- there is very strong Pennsylvania policy embodied in two places in its Constitution indicating that Pennsylvania would not enforce a limitation of that kind within the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.744" offset="14986324">Judge Van Dusen has indicated correctly that this question has not recently been decided in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.107" offset="15011819">There are old cases in which the court has refused to enforce penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.023" offset="15031463">Your Honors know that the conflicts law on this point is in the state of flux.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.318" offset="15048600">The old rule was that the damaged law of the site of the injury would be the law applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.451" offset="15073155">But under the redraft of the restatement which has not yet been adopted and in fact, maybe isn't even published yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.050" offset="15103561">And under the Kilberg case and the Pearson case, it is evident that the law is changing so that someday in the not too distant future, the conflicts of law rule is going to be the law of damages will apply which is the law of the state having the most contacts with the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.207" offset="15184227">Pennsylvania has not recently passed on that point but because of its constitutional policy, I believe that the best probabilities are that Pennsylvania would adopt the so-called Pearson conflicts rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.231" offset="15236263">That means then that a District Court sitting in Pennsylvania under Klaxon versus Stentor obliged to follow the conflicts of law rule of Pennsylvania, would have to consider what Pennsylvania Supreme Court would decide on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.329" offset="15292688">If we send this case up to Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Court will do what?</text>

            <text syncTime="3806.232" offset="15328319">Under Klaxon versus Stentor, this point is not decided and as Your Honors know better than I, there are cases each way on this point.</text>
