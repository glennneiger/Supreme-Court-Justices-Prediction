            <label>Mr. O. John Rogge</label>
            <text syncTime="12.314" offset="152639">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.223" offset="176253">This case presents the question whether the body execution statute of the State of New York violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.920" offset="223065">It is my position that it does and in support of that position, I am going to suggest an approach to the Due Process Clause which I think is in accord with its intervening and historical development which is at one and the same time less inclusive than what has been called the incorporation theory based upon the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Douglas and also the concurrence on this point of Justices Murphy and Rutledge in Adamson against California and on the other hand, is more inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.270" offset="392443">I say less inclusive because I don't think it's historically correct to say that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866 anymore than the barons already made almost three quarters of a millennium earlier when they exacted from King John.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.937" offset="475094">He promised not to go against them except by the law of the land that they thought about it specifically what it meant other than it meant to do right.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.894" offset="518980">I don't think it's historically correct to say therefore that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by itself incorporated the first state amendments and made them applicable to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.660" offset="566000">On the other hand, I submit that the Due Process Clause does represent the better angel of our nature and therefore shouldn't be limited to the first state amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.448" offset="613125">For example, there is a provision in the Fourteenth Amendment for equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.757" offset="634441">If it were not there, can there be any doubt but that today justice that's not even handed would be struck down under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.289" offset="688567">There is in the Thirteenth Amendment, for instance, the provision against involuntary servitude except for those who've been convicted of a crime after a due trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.749" offset="726392">If it were not there, can it be any doubt -- can there be any doubt but that today under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.272" offset="756485">There couldn't be involuntary servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.930" offset="767143">On that basis -- on that approach, I submit that the body execution statute of the State of New York violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on five different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.397" offset="824926">It violates it because it imposes the punishment without the incidence of a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.485" offset="849272">There was a default judgment in this case never anything more.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.463" offset="869230">It violates the Due Process Clause in the second place because the body execution statute which was Section 764 of the Civil Practice Act bears no reasonable relationship to the ends, the Legislature had in mind when they enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.312" offset="936626">It violates the Due Process Clause in the third place because when this body execution statute is taken together with a couple of sections of the New York Correction Law, it denies the petitioner of equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.243" offset="996394">A rich man won't have to go to jail for six months the way my client will if he goes back to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.881" offset="1018859">He's not in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.898" offset="1022934">He had to leave New York a minute that order for body execution was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.515" offset="1049475">Therefore, it violates the Due Process Clause because it denied him the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.115" offset="1075806">In the fourth place, this Section violates the Due Process Clause because it imposes upon him a cruel and an unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.155" offset="1107989">And in the fifth place, it violates the Due Process Clause because it imposes upon him involuntary services.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.116" offset="1139858">Now, before I get to the merits of the case, there are two nagging procedural questions that I'd like to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.580" offset="1177684">The Attorney General of the State of New York says that I did and exhaust state court remedies in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.628" offset="1201925">I say that I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.451" offset="1209135">He says that I don't have a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.282" offset="1220524">I say that I do but I say it doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.860" offset="1238810">You had in this case a judgment of the trial court, Mr. Justice Gellinoff who ordered that execution be issued here and against the person of Morris Gotthilf defendant herein without notice to said defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.207" offset="1292204">Had my client stayed in New York?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.807" offset="1298578">He didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.441" offset="1305161">The sheriff could had seized him and put him in prison for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.763" offset="1326373">I say that under any normal concept and indeed, under the language of the New York Court of Appeals itself in those few instances where it took time out to give us -- give us a few lines of opinion that was the final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.602" offset="1373811">Certainly that it's the final judgment under 28 U.S.C. Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.671" offset="1394082">Now, if it's' a final judgment, then I submit that I exhausted state court remedies by trying to go to the New York Court of Appeals and the only two ways that I could go there, if it's a final judgment, (a) by docketing an appeal of the right because I have a constitutional question, (b) by making emotion for leave to go there supported by printed affidavits and a printed brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.608" offset="1489795">These were denied, dismissed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that I didn't have a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.003" offset="1515395">If I didn't' have a final judgment, then I say I didn't have a right to go there and under those circumstances, I exhausted state court remedies by going to the Appellate Division, First Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.373" offset="1560848">So I say to the Attorney General of the State of New York and the courts of the State of New York, they can play games with words if they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.061" offset="1587597">Whether or not it -- they call it a final judgment, makes no difference, if it's final, I exhausted state court remedies by trying to go to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.028" offset="1619466">If by some part of New York law that final judgment isn't the final judgment, then I exhausted state court remedies by going to the Appellate Division, Second Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.556" offset="1657605">But beyond all this, I say that what I really come down to here is the language of 28 U.S.C. Section 1257 and then under that, it is a final judgment and here, I would rely especially on the case that the New York Attorney General cites in his brief, Republic Natural Gas Company against Oklahoma and I deal with it in the reply brief on page 14 where this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Frankfurter, said, "There had been instances where the Court has entertained an appeal of an order that otherwise might be deemed interlocutory because the controversy had proceeded to a point where a losing party would be irreparably injured if review were unavailing."</text>
            <text syncTime="430.642" offset="1825938">If this Court does not give relief, my client, the petitioner, Gotthilf, can never go back to the State of New York because there is an order for body execution under which he'd have to go to jail for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.277" offset="1872436">There is no escape from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.748" offset="1878392">He can't make bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.861" offset="1986853">So he wouldn't have to go to jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.752" offset="2462386">And if you look at the cross-reference table in the beginning, they tell you that Section 764 has been omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.892" offset="2498957">But they cross-reference you to Section 6111 and I say that's even worse because that Section provides that in the discretion of the Court, this order of arrest may be granted without notice before or after service of summons and at anytime before or after judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.269" offset="2584430">Now, they call that a provisional remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1101.288" offset="4508505">Now, I'd like to go back just a moment to the controversy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.330" offset="4528671">The original controversy arose out of a factoring agreement and the one who actually lend the money was the corporation, the corporate defendant of which the petitioner was Chairman of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.009" offset="4591365">And there was at one time when the plaintiff corporation was embedded to the defendant corporation in the amount of sum $22,000 and for this, they had a collateral sum $28,000 which according to the defendant $23,000 that was worth was collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.705" offset="4670151">They entered into an agreement by which the individual plaintiffs in that action were to pay $13,000 and I think they did and the defendant was to make certain collections and turn them over for taxes, and I understand he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.010" offset="4743398">However, that maybe, there isn't any question but what the judgment here is the result of a default order and that arose of a misunderstanding between counsels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.733" offset="4806301">The, then, counsel for the petitioner Archibald Palmer swears that he had an understanding with counsel for the plaintiff that the default would only be entered as to the corporate defendant and not the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.228" offset="4872234">Mr. Theodore Charnas whose admission I moved this morning and for whom I have a high regard says he never had any such understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.251" offset="4912358">Now, it's inconceivable to me that a lawyer for a client who has a good defense and the defense there among other things despite all the charges and counter charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.194" offset="4964185">The defense among other things would have been to whatever the petitioner did, he did in a corporate capacity as Chairman of the Board, indeed the complaint itself have allegations saying that the defendant by Gotthilf, the petitioner here did certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.027" offset="5027506">I mean it's conceivable to me that a lawyer would have consented to a default order not only to the corporation but also to the individual defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.042" offset="5087587">However, that maybe, I don't know what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.414" offset="5101066">They're disputed one side on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.778" offset="7878510">And here again I say that the general practice in the State of New York is that, when an application is made to an Appellate Division for leave to appeal on a certified question, it is the general practice for the Appellate Division if it believes that the question has any substance to certify the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.702" offset="7970147">And finally I would say, since that -- insofar as jurisdiction is concerned, that since this Court has a rule that only final orders are to be considered by this Court, nothing, no reason, no valid reason is given for departure, nothing at all, and very solemn indeed if ever has this Court given -- taken jurisdiction where a -- where a petitioner has failed to exhaust the remedies available to him in the lower court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.148" offset="8235969">Mr. Gotthilf was Chairman of the Board and run Charge-IT Systems Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.632" offset="8265853">Sills of Chamber to the Corporation deposited some $28,000 worth of accounts receivable with Charged-IT Systems and they paid well for the advances given by Charge-IT Systems against this collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.838" offset="8334712">There came a time when there was a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.628" offset="8349863">Cambridge -- Sills of Cambridge Inc. said, "You're overcharging us" and there was a big fight and Charge-IT Systems raised the question about the value of the collateral and they agreed to settle it on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.002" offset="8411408">The two Sills brothers personally who have not previously been personally obligated agreed to pay $13,000 to Charge-IT Systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.161" offset="8456025">Charge-IT Systems agreed to continue to collect the collateral and because Sills of Cambridge was indebted to the Internal Revenue Service, Gotthilf, that's Charge-IT Systems, agreed to remit from the receipts from the collateral periodically to the Internal Revenue Service so that Sills of Cambridge could be credited with this payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.965" offset="8571277">Gotthilf drew the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.641" offset="8585906">It was executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.086" offset="8591757">It's a -- it was next of the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.102" offset="8611819">The Sills brothers paid promptly and over a period of 10 months, they've paid the full $13,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.761" offset="8642435">And each month, they received their copy of a letter signed by Gotthilf reporting that the copy of a letter sent to the Internal Revenue Service which in substance ran something like this, "Dear Mr. Sprinson," Mr. Sprinson being the man in-charge of the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to our letter of so and so."</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.996" offset="8731355">You will find enclosed here with our check, so and so for $400 ode covering the payments we received in September from the customer showing on the X list."</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.674" offset="8770017">We got a thin copy of such a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.665" offset="8786004">And in our naïve pay, we assumed that the check had gone out, that the original had gone to the Internal Revenue Service, and so the Sills brothers paid the money periodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.573" offset="8833651">And then lo and behold, it was discovered that no such payments were ever made for the Internal Revenue Service, nothing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.642" offset="8869909">So Gotthilf got his $13,000, kept the money he collected from the collateral, is now residing himself in Florida and my opponent says, "Look what we are doing to this poor exhausted individual, this indigent man whom we are playing alive apparently in the Supreme Court of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.108" offset="8967816">But we started an action and that we alleged this in the action and we got a verified answer and Gotthilf, we sued Gotthilf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.452" offset="9009194">We sued Gotthilf because there was separate torts committed by Gotthilf and committed by the Corporation that he was chair -- of which he was the Chairman of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.921" offset="9043048">And Gotthilf didn't deny our allegations that the checks and letters were never sent to the Internal Revenue Service, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.347" offset="9080769">He said that Sills of Cambridge had deceived him into entering into the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.721" offset="9106265">Therefore, he had kept the proceeds of the -- of the collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.309" offset="9128626">He never disavowed the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.054" offset="9139597">He continued very politely to pocket the $13,000, but this he asserted as an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.474" offset="9177318">A motion was made to examine him before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.573" offset="9197693">He default it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.295" offset="9204590">We telephoned Mr. Palmer's office, he's then attorney that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.434" offset="9221099">Mr. Palmer said he had abandoned the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.321" offset="9232697">Now, the argument was raised subsequently by Mr. Palmer that an agreement has been made between Mr. Palmer and myself, that I would abandon the action as against Mr. Gotthilf personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.000" offset="9295391">I sworn then, I sworn the Appellate Division and I take oath before you gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.627" offset="9317857">There was never such an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.409" offset="9324962">It would have been preposterous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.287" offset="9332485">Why should I have tried to collect from a corporation which by that time I knew was the fund, Charge-IT Systems be fund?</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.122" offset="9371878">Why should I chase Charge-IT Systems and not Gotthilf?</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.210" offset="9388178">It would have been clearly idiotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.625" offset="9401866">But lower court believed me, the Appellate Division and I asked you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.610" offset="9425795">In any event, we move to examine before trial, he defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.278" offset="9452440">We then move to strike his answer, all noticed, he defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.148" offset="9475950">We have served it with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.642" offset="9481906">We then move for an inquest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.643" offset="9489951">And an inquest is the taking of testimony before a judge with the presentation of proof of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.952" offset="9519208">We did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.021" offset="9523493">We brought in -- we brought in the president of our cooperation of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.554" offset="9541569">We brought in Mr. Sprinson of the Internal Revenue Service who testified that they've never gotten the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.830" offset="9562676">Now, strangely enough, Mr. Palmer was given -- who had been given notice of the inquest by me appeared at the inquest and the judge presiding turned to him and said, "We invite you to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.676" offset="9630072">We invite you to take part in these proceedings."</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.347" offset="9644805">He declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.250" offset="9648358">He turned and walked away and willfully defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.761" offset="9662464">Now, it may be argued that what else could he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.377" offset="9672913">Well, he could do this if there were no damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.317" offset="9684616">He was in a position to cross-examine and to present even such proof as he care to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.320" offset="9704678">But he walked away from the inquest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.893" offset="9714918">So of course the judgment was entered, predicated upon fraud and when the appeal was taken on due notice, the Appellate Division of the First Department affirmed, so that the judgment stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.494" offset="9789315">Now, the question arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.542" offset="9793494">How do you get this judgment to like it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.963" offset="9815228">We, then, found Section 764 of the Civil Practice Act which states to the Court may, in its discretion, incarcerate a debtor in certain types of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.019" offset="9871444">One of those actions is an action for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.079" offset="9891715">This was clearly an action for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.929" offset="9903104">Now, we didn't go out and arrest this man and take him off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.496" offset="9925360">We served him with notice and we went before a Supreme Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.240" offset="9944377">One would think that a debtor in this position would say to a court that, "This is what I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.526" offset="9969455">This is what I earn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.297" offset="9976560">This is what I expect to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.609" offset="9985860">This is how I expect to do the proper thing, the right thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.536" offset="10001533">This is how I want to win the approval of the Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.967" offset="10015222">All he did in his affidavit was say that it was a default judgment that it have entered against him, that it was improper, something to the effect that this was a great country and he didn't believe that this should be done to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.554" offset="14145599">Well, I don't think that would be the normal way of handling this because this is an unusual situation where the -- this is not the kind of thing where you bring -- where you have a debtor before a judge and the judge says, "Well, disclose what you've got, and on the basis of what you tell me," the judge might say, "Well, if you don't pay $10 a week, I would consider this to be flouting the dignity of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.889" offset="14250924">I'm going to send you to jail."</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.734" offset="14258343">Now, that might well be, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.248" offset="14264404">That might very well be the situation even here, but this is the most unusual situation, this man, fleeing the State before that making no disclosure and leaving us here while he's in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.737" offset="14322291">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. O. John Rogge</label>
            <text syncTime="3556.256" offset="14328351">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.431" offset="14333053">I want to challenge the statements that there is any case either in the Court of Appeals or any place else in the State of New York which says that if you make a full disclosure, you don't have to go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.216" offset="14372237">There isn't any such case or I've overlooked it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.293" offset="14384567">Now, when counsel says, "Full disclosure wasn't made them in this affidavit," he's also attacking me because I sat down with the client and helped him prepare those affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.088" offset="14419675">And Your Honors will find the first one at pages -- of the record, pages 10 to 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.407" offset="14481011">And I end up by saying there and I thought this was a good affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.704" offset="14498147">He has to point out he is a certified public accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.419" offset="14509014">And he says, "I am present and available for any supplementary proceedings which the attorneys for the plaintiff may wish to conduct and I will continue to be present."</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.870" offset="14542869">He offers to pull his bond to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.379" offset="14552900">The judge said that it isn't good enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.362" offset="14560841">I prepared a supplementary affidavit and this is one at pages 21 and 22, and I think I know how to ask questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.893" offset="14590934">I asked him, "What's he got, does he have office furniture?</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.491" offset="14601383">Does he have an automobile?</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.978" offset="14607235">Does his wife have a fur coat?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.523" offset="14613504">Incidentally, the judge asked all those questions in chambers too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.848" offset="14626774">He didn't have anything except his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.036" offset="14635551">So I prepared a supplemental affidavit in which I -- in which I say to the judge in his file, "I have no assets and the only income that I received is from my business."</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.684" offset="14678079">He puts in there what his income is for the last four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.911" offset="14695006">This was a disastrous venture form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.768" offset="14702425">He lost everything he had and his wife had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.609" offset="14713814">I then go in and I argued with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.115" offset="14723845">I said, "Let's offer a 25% of net income."</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.029" offset="14739519">He then wanted -- before or after taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.599" offset="14749759">I said, "Don't push with that, offer a straight 25% from now on of what you make."</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.400" offset="14772955">But I said, "Let's put in a final paragraph."</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.459" offset="14785181">And he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.382" offset="14788942">I said, "My heart pumps me to add two further flaws," and they both stand from the fear that I have not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.654" offset="14814020">He's only speaking, if you please, that I have not appealed through Your Honors' discretion despite the fact that I have offered to do a little more than I think I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.392" offset="14848920">The first thought is that he at my offer of 25% of my net income is not high enough in the Court's opinion that I will try to comply with what the Court suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.240" offset="14888312">It ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.463" offset="14893223">And the Court wouldn't make a suggestion except yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.658" offset="14902000">The judge didn't say this to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.636" offset="14909942">He said, "From my experience, I know this kind of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.780" offset="14930526">They'll pay if I enter the order."</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.350" offset="14940766">That was the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.583" offset="14949752">He goes on here to say in this affidavit, the second thought is this, "If the Court does grant the motion for body execution, my life is through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.343" offset="14984756">I'll have to leave the State or go to jail," and he does leave the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.793" offset="14998549">I challenged all the statements that he didn't bare his status because I was there with him in questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.496" offset="15025403">And the judge put the same questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.532" offset="15033448">The judge asked about fur coat, about jewels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.051" offset="15043584">The judge went further to ask some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.073" offset="15051630">I didn't -- what about his sons?</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.088" offset="15059675">Don't they have money?</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.226" offset="15064273">Are there any relatives or families that have money and still in spite of all of these, the judge enters this body execution order under which he can either pay or go to jail for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.028" offset="15115473">There isn't any alternative, at least there wasn't in the way in which this judge applied 764 and that's the question that is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.950" offset="15155179">It was either you pay half now, you flip security for the balance or you go to jail for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.803" offset="15186631">And that's what I'm challenging.</text>
