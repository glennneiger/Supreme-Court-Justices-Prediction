            <text syncTime="50.952" offset="307179">This is a capital case here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama and it involves the question whether the courts of that state can refuse to give petitioner an opportunity to put on evidence and then affirm his conviction because he failed to carry a burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.086" offset="387741">The facts are these, petitioner John Coleman is a Negro, who was indicted and convicted for the murder of a white man by juries of Greene County Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.149" offset="436015">Greene County is in the Western part of the state, a very rural country.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.633" offset="457853">Approximately 80% of the population is of the Negro race.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.757" offset="478438">At petitioner's trial, it was represented by Court appointed white attorney, who failed and did not assert his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.268" offset="520443">The juries chose him without systematic exclusion of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.818" offset="538624">After conviction, a Negro attorney was called into the case by petitioner's family.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.948" offset="563179">He filed a timely motion for new trial explicitly alleging systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand and petit jury, and a hearing was held on this motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.037" offset="611558">But at the hearing, counsel was not permitted to introduce testimony establishing systematic exclusion of Negroes because the trial court, at the urging of the prosecutor, took the view that the question could not be raised for the first time on motion for new trial, that it -- it had to be raised under Alabama procedure prior to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.545" offset="709569">On appeal --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="152.463" offset="713226">Is it both (Inaudible)</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_c_meltsner" startTime="155.153" stopTime="412.878">
            <label>Mr. Michael C. Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="155.153" offset="723989">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.473" offset="729213">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Alabama held that petitioner had had an opportunity at the hearing on the motion for new trial to introduce evidence of systematic exclusion that he had the burden of proof and that he had not placed into evidence sufficient evidence to prove jury discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.149" offset="815940">The Court said absolutely nothing about any waiver and quite clearly decided the case on a ground which made waiver moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.927" offset="851048">Now, as the ruling of the Supreme Court of Alabama which we ask this Court to reverse is the opportunity which that Court said petitioner had on the hearing for motion for new trial to introduce evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.943" offset="919176">I refer the Court to that hearing which is in the record, pages 15 to 23, and mainly we're concerned with that portion of the hearing which begins on page 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.909" offset="974973">Let's expose what happened at that hearing where the Supreme Court of Alabama says petitioner had an opportunity to carry a burden of proof and to introduce evidence of systematic exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.690" offset="1034115">Petitioner's counsel at the hearing attempts to place on the stand the two Circuit Solicitors who had tried petitioner in order to prove the allegations of the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.969" offset="1087300">And on page 18, we see the response of the Circuit Solicitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.136" offset="1107884">He argues that the question has been waived and there on the 11th line at page 19, he urges to the trial court, we don't think any evidence along that line would be legal and we would object any evidence because it would just be a waste of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.529" offset="1165458">Now at this point, the trial judge says he doesn't know what petitioner's counsel would put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.631" offset="1193880">Petitioner's counsel attempts to offer proper -- the kind of proof he's willing to put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.757" offset="1222405">He argues that the trial court has the discretion to hear that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.571" offset="1241631">The trial judge says, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.967" offset="1247274">You put your witness on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.706" offset="1258245">If there are any objections to the questions you ask him.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.473" offset="1273292">I'll rule on the questions, on the objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.296" offset="1288547">In that way, we'll determine the issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="298.441" offset="1297115">So on page 20, the Solicitor is placed on the stand and the foundation is laid.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.785" offset="1330552">He -- he testifies that he's practiced law on the county for a number of years, that he is familiar with Negroes and Whites in the county, that he has never missed the grand jury in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.045" offset="1379558">But when the question comes now, “What's the population or the ratio -- population ratio between the races?”</text>
            <text syncTime="327.942" offset="1415189">Bang!</text>
            <text syncTime="328.460" offset="1417174">Objection, the issue can't be raised for the first time on motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.014" offset="1439431">And on page 22 of the record, the trial court clearly sustains that objection on just that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.585" offset="1469733">Petitioner's attorney asks two more questions, how many Negroes if any were on the grand jury, same objection, same disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.827" offset="1506722">How many Negroes if any were on the petit jury, same objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.564" offset="1521664">He can't take advantage of the Fourteenth Amendment this way, same disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.271" offset="1548413">Now, it's elementary I think that -- that this is not a hearing consummate with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.005" offset="1587388">There was no opportunity to introduce testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.767" offset="1602435">And I don't understand the state now to take the position that -- a position contrary to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.859" offset="1634826">Although the state opposed rehearing and the Supreme Court of Alabama on that ground, that petitioner did have an opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.242" offset="1672338">But now the state seems to be arguing something different that -- it was in fact the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.718" offset="1698252">I don't believe that the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama, the judgment here on review, is susceptible to that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.128" offset="1739839">First, the Court said absolutely nothing about waiver.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael C. Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="445.654" offset="1886020">The Court didn't mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.915" offset="1891035">The state cited waiver cases to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.126" offset="1911829">They were not cited in the Court -- in the Supreme Court of Alabama's opinion but fairly easy idea to convey.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.578" offset="1933667">There are many opinions in -- in Alabama where -- where the waiver holding is the one which disposes of the case, nothing like it in this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.359" offset="1976822">But most important, the Supreme Court of Alabama decided this case on the ground which is totally incompatible with the finding or holding of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.759" offset="2022379">In other words, what the Supreme Court of Alabama did and it's right here on pages 32 and 33 of the record, in its opinion, it held that petitioner had a burden of proof and he hadn't -- haven't met, it held on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.456" offset="2085177">Now, if you don't have any right, it makes no difference whatsoever, how much evidence you put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.329" offset="2112658">What the -- what the trial court did was say you had no right, so you can't put on any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.577" offset="2137631">What the Supreme Court of Alabama does, put that -- put the waiver argument to the side and decide completely on the basis of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.352" offset="2180786">Now, I don't think it's important whether or not the Supreme Court of Alabama had any power under Alabama law as viewed from prior cases to do what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.783" offset="2238464">The judgment in this case is bottomed on a finding of the evidence, not on a finding of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.864" offset="2274826">The -- the judgment of the -- in this case is bottomed on petitioner's opportunity to introduce proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.398" offset="2308995">But nonetheless, there are Alabama cases, the Clark and Arrington cases which are cited on page 12 in our brief, where the Supreme Court of Alabama has done exactly what it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.403" offset="2361031">In other words, the jury question was raised for the first time on motion for new trial, the case came up from the Supreme Court of Alabama and it decided the case on the evidence or indicated that it had the power to decide the case on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.593" offset="2425710">There is even a -- a very recent case on coram nobis where the Supreme Court of Alabama said we know in deciding this case that the petitioner here did not raise this question prior to trial or on motion for new trial, that's the Howard case in 151 Southern Reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.907" offset="2515048">And there's another one where the same statement is made, the Sills case, 126 Southern Reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.194" offset="2544097">So as we view this case, it comes clearly under the rule of Cole versus Alabama, recently reaffirmed by this Court, I think about two weeks ago in the Shuttlesworth case, that a Supreme Court of a state must dispose of a case upon consideration of what happened in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.346" offset="2640750">Now, in Cole the -- the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas on the basis of a violation of law which was not tried below and this Court reversed it because the -- the criminal defendant did not have an opportunity to defend himself to put in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.816" offset="2722670">So here, petitioner has not had an opportunity to put in evidence establishing a constitutional defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.128" offset="2755897">The reason he hasn't had that opportunity is because the trial court took the view totally incompatible with the view taken by the Supreme Court of Alabama, that he had no right, no right to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.933" offset="2807097">Now, I think coming to this record Cole, the Court might have some question about why the Supreme Court did what it did, even though it's totally explicit, what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.588" offset="2857775">And I think the answer is in two cases briefly discussed in our brief, the Sills and Golsby cases in which the Fifth Circuit has held that in situations like this, where a Negro is represented by a court appointed white lawyer in the South, and the state does not show that he knowingly and intentionally waived his constitutional rights that if the Fifth Circuit is held that it will not be precluded from examining the evidence of the jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.502" offset="2993403">And the Supreme Court of Alabama knows about this cases and it is modifying what -- what we might call its traditional policy of -- of being fairly hard on litigants who don't raise the question early in light of these cases, in light of its knowledge that the same issue was going to be relitigated in the Fifth Circuit if the Supreme Court of Alabama holds waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.821" offset="3102699">But I want to make it perfectly clear that I don't think any analysis based on those cases is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.162" offset="3132061">The Supreme Court of Alabama did what it did, and that's the judgment here for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.003" offset="3155362">The only -- the only way I can rationalize the State's argument is that they are saying to this Court, Alabama's Supreme Court could've held waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.100" offset="3211786">It could've decided in this case on nonfederal grounds, and if -- because the Supreme Court of Alabama didn't do it, it could have, this Court should do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.499" offset="3253373">Now there are a long line of cases where this sort of position has been argued to the Court and it's always been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.478" offset="3281272">The leading case is -- is Grayson versus Howard -- Harrison in 267 U.S.I would like to reserve my time.</text>
