            <label>Mr. Thurman Arnold</label>
            <text syncTime="17.450" offset="173223">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.665" offset="186075">The case is -- presents a very simple and clear-cut issue to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.931" offset="219094">It involves the liability of a railroad for damages for spoilage of fruit in a case where it has carried out its burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.881" offset="278862">And the jury has specifically found that it is without negligence and it's carried on all its obligations without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.139" offset="327973">Our position is that under the federal common law, as applied by the Carmack Amendment, the obligation of the railroad is solely to assume the burden of proof of showing that there were -- was no negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.552" offset="413550">In the early days, as the Court probably knows, the only exemption from liability to your -- to your hand was act of God or the public enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.155" offset="467989">But as time developed and transportation increased, it -- it's came to include, add to the Government, add to the shipper an inherent vice in the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.652" offset="522010">And there, developed an exception when cattle were shipped and would tend as -- to injure each other and all the railroad had to prove was due care and lack of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.361" offset="580838">And later as the shipment of fruits became a tremendous enterprise going over long distance, the -- the cattle exception was extended to perishable fruits and vegetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.649" offset="637994">And I think it had to be because if the inherent vice means anything, then it -- the tendency of vegetables to decay is an inherent vice.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.260" offset="692433">Second place, we assert that we're exonerated from liability on proof of freedom from fault by the terms of the bill of lading itself, which exempts the carrier from liability if the damage is caused by inherent vice in the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.623" offset="777906">In the third place, we are exempt from liability by the protective tariff services.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.552" offset="809566">It is provided that the shipper may pay for what is called "protective services".</text>
            <text syncTime="186.003" offset="847391">And in the regulations covering those services, the liability of the carrier specifically brought out and it includes only liability where he has caused the damage and where there is some fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.027" offset="911444">Now, the respondent takes the position that inherent vice means some peculiar defect in vegetables which are not present in ordinary vegetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.704" offset="982183">It means that the mere tendency to decay is not an inherent vice in the goods and that the carrier therefore must prove more than freedom from negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.934" offset="1031084">He must pursue -- prove precisely what did cause the decay.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.371" offset="1056893">And of course, that means he is liable as the insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.026" offset="1079463">We assert in our brief and we reexamine the cases that all of the cases are against to be -- the position of the respondent with respect to their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.832" offset="1134738">The cases which he cites in his favor are it is true fruits and vegetable cases but they're not cases of decay.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.798" offset="1174549">They are cases of spoilage and completely irrelevant here.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.686" offset="1826147">They were consigned to Chicago, Illinois in 1958.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.191" offset="1908172">If you drop one and break the honeydew melon or any commodity, it breaks, it's spoiled.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.921" offset="2051009">They brought one down from New York all the way to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.502" offset="2061354">He was an expert named Huss (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="491.400" offset="2068982">He testified as did Sleigh WW (ph), that's a western land inspection bureau, their Government aids or inspection agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.709" offset="2102209">They testified that they associated with -- with immaturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.383" offset="2116942">Actually, in the case, they had some other melons that arrived slightly green and that's the melons that they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.459" offset="2145259">But the undisputed evidence in this case, according to the destination inspection was that they were mature.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.166" offset="2168038">In fact, the word "mature" is used on the U.S. Government destination inspection and they admitted that whether they're white to cream, there were no green in this, white to cream, well, that was evidence of maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.827" offset="2210670">The only other evidence, we say, that bruising follows that -- discoloration and decay follows bruising and they bear that out in -- in one respect in that they say slight abrasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.935" offset="2267094">And now, when they say slight abrasions, well, that's -- that's just discussed -- placed and that could occur in transit.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.956" offset="2379212">But we also have a finding by the jury that the melons were in a worsen condition and would reasonably be anticipated upon their arrival in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.102" offset="2419754">They also have a finding by the jury that the damage was not due to an inherent vice.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.068" offset="2547649">As a matter of fact, insofar as inherent vice is concerned, it's not clear from their argument whether we make out the issue of inherent vice when we show arrival in damage condition or we, at the same time, I guess according to their theory, we're making out -- we're disproving our own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.551" offset="2625599">We have to show it's spoiled or at least we have to show that it arrived in a worsened condition and it was at the time we delivered it to the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.391" offset="2656946">So we must automatically be proven that it was unaccepted cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.870" offset="2678888">The -- the argument to me is -- is ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.922" offset="2691009">But if you -- you can carry a little further and -- and see how absurd it might become.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.644" offset="2721938">For example, in the -- in the brief -- in their brief, reply brief, they say that once the jury finds that a carrier is free from negligence, then you have shown inherent vice.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.274" offset="2776482">And the issue should never have even been submitted to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.882" offset="2790902">Well, now, I don't understand which -- which they're doing when it -- when we show it around as spoiled, does that -- does that mean it's inherent vice?</text>
            <text syncTime="680.655" offset="2826010">Or when they show it freedom from negligence, does that mean it's inherent vice?</text>
            <text syncTime="684.841" offset="2842728">Put it another way, if the railroad were negligent and they come in and say, "Yes, we are negligent."</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.428" offset="6101034">And the -- the -- some of the confusion that results, I think in his argument that he says that it's -- that all -- all commodities will decay, and that's also said in the Itule case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.160" offset="6171982">That's not a true statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.023" offset="6195493">It's not going to decay unless it has bacteria and an opening for the bacteria to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.765" offset="6214405">And even then, proper humidity and temperature and so forth will retort it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.142" offset="6231960">But if you don't have those factors, it's not going to automatically decay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.560" offset="6249618">The use of the term "decay" in this case con -- confuses this, just one of -- of a number of different causes of damages that can occur to various commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.837" offset="6294758">I still do not know whether they admit liability before this Court for bruising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.048" offset="6315551">They admitted it for bruising up in -- in the lower court and yet that -- that position is not proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.970" offset="6351287">They should admit it if it occurred in transit, they should be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.870" offset="6366856">If it occurred before transit, they should not be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.410" offset="6380962">They confuse natural deterioration with inherent vice and then refused it in his own -- in his own statement when he says there that -- that fruit and vegetables die from the moment that you harvest them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.704" offset="6454209">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.012" offset="6459434">And as he says -- he says it on the next page, he says that, "As a matter of fact, a lot of these are peak -- picked before the peak."</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.801" offset="6502588">And the only -- only thing -- only good that a honeydew melon or any other fruit and vegetable is, is to eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.436" offset="6529128">And when you pick these honeydew melons or when you pick in -- and pack tomatoes, we were talking about them, at the -- at the time they're not edible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.717" offset="6570193">They're picked matured green and in case of honeydew melons, why they're mature but then they're gassed and then they ripen up to market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.090" offset="6607705">It is just like you go in and you buy tomato that's not quite ripe in the market, you leave it at home for two or three day before you consume it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.591" offset="6637693">And it's the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.743" offset="6642395">Actually, they don't -- they continue to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.039" offset="6655561">And if a commodity -- if -- if somebody were foolish enough, if some shipper were foolish enough to ship a carload of red ripe tomatoes and they got to appear and they were completely spoiled and overripe, the railroad would have the burden of showing the cause of the damage but it would not be an inherent vice, it's natural deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.232" offset="6760260">Then after they reach that peak that they're going to be used for, then they began a period of natural deterioration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2600.455" offset="10505174">The jury was instruct to find the railroad if they found -- the jury was instructed to find for the railroad if they found there was no negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.246" offset="10552404">Now, there is some inconsistent, apparently inconsistent findings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.454" offset="10573197">If you turn to the record on page 180, the bottom, Special Issue Number 6, do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the worsened condition if any of the honeydew melons in the car at the time of the delivery of Boston was solely due to an inherent vice, as that term was here in the finding existing, it's a time the melons were received by the carrier at the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.441" offset="10681135">Now, there are several findings like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.480" offset="10689285">And the jury answered no to all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.701" offset="10698167">And counsel was quite honest in his admission that those are not affirmative findings at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.441" offset="10725125">Under the Texas rule which we set out on page -- footnote -- page 5 and 6 of our brief, we give the cases supporting the admission of both counsels, that those are not affirmative findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.516" offset="10793462">So there is no instances and findings in this case under the Texas rule.</text>
