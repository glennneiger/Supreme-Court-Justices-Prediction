            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="62.099" offset="351796">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.315" offset="356603">I am sharing the appellant's time with Mr. Amos Mathews, counsel for the appellant, Motor Carriers and Rail Carriers in Number 421.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.242" offset="400384">These two consolidated appeals are from the judgment of a three-judge District Court which set aside an order issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.250" offset="440404">Commission's order directed the appellee Shannon to cease and desist from engaging in for-hire transportation of sugar in interstate commerce without appropriate operating authority from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.797" offset="506546">This case presents a question of importance for the entire transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.803" offset="530578">That is how to draw a practical line between for-hire motor transportation whether common or contract and bona fide private carriage on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.370" offset="596825">By way of background, this question is one aspect about an important aspect of what Congress, the Commission and the transportation industry had been referring to as gray area of transportation for some years.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.812" offset="670595">Gray area of transportation is a shorthand phrase which covers a variety of devices by which what is in substance for-hire transportation is carried on by motor carriers without a common carrier certificate and/or without a contract carrier from it, thereby eroding the traffic available to the regulated public carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.248" offset="776338">Two years ago, we presented one important aspect of the gray area problem to this Court, In United States v. Drum in 368 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.447" offset="825135">In Drum, this Court upheld the Commission's view that where a shipment leased -- that where a shipper leased the services and the equipment of owner operators of trucks without assuming the real financial risks of engaging in a transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.845" offset="910712">Then, though the Court held with this, a shipper was not engaged in bona fide private carriage and the owner operators were engaged in for-hire transportation as contract carriers because on that record, in the Drum case, they were assuming the real risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.512" offset="989393">Now, in this case, we are dealing with a frequent type of situation and -- and for the Commission a number of times, in a number of times from the past and currently in the lower federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.220" offset="1048221">When a person who is engaged and admittedly bona fide a private transportation in the outbound transportation of his goods, from his place of business, seeks to obtain some kind of freight for the other -- other -- for the otherwise empty return trip or backhaul movement of his trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.420" offset="1145083">Now, what do we mean by private carriage?</text>
            <text syncTime="263.070" offset="1155636">Now, briefly, Section 203 (c) of Interstate Commerce Act, which appears at page 36 of our brief, says in effect that a private carrier is a person who has transportation of his own property is within the scope and in furtherance of a primary business enterprise other than transportation of such person.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.416" offset="1261066">And the typical example of admittedly bona fide private transportation and this happened all over the country without a question, is for a manufacturer or distributor uses his own trucks to transport his finished product, to distributing or retail outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.180" offset="1340061">And on his return trip or backhaul, he brings back raw materials or supplies to be used in his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.721" offset="1378304">Now, the basic fact of life for all carriers, either for-hire carriers or private carriers, is that empty return trip movements increase the cost of moving a given unit of freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.561" offset="1441625">In its extreme form that this means that any kind of carrier, public or private, figures that it is better off, if it can obtain some freight for the return trip, if it only covers the fuel cost or part of the fuel cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.199" offset="1512155">And so it is that private carriers are naturally tempted to try to get some kind of paying cargo on their otherwise empty return trip or backhaul movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.348" offset="1564714">Now, turning to the facts of this case, Shannon has a partnership in San Antonio, Texas and since 1934, it engaged in buying and selling livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.436" offset="1613093">In 1951, it broadened its business to include the handling of fertilizer, grain, molasses, salt, and other items in the feed line.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.668" offset="1658023">In 1954, Shannon began to engage in the sugar transactions which are initially here.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.379" offset="1688848">As we see it, the crucial facts, Mr. Shannon's sugar transactions are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.394" offset="1712985">First, Shannon buys and takes title to the sugar at a sugar refinery at Supreme, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.988" offset="1739316">It's about 40 miles West of New Orleans and its 525 miles from San Antonio.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.184" offset="1768155">Shannon buys sugar only when it can be carried and the return trip or backhaul movement of one of its trucks which is stated an outbound delivery in the direction of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.500" offset="1825416">At no time has Shannon purchased sugar to be transported otherwise than in its own trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.884" offset="1862928">In other words, Shannon's purchases of sugar had been measured solely by the otherwise empty backhaul capacity of its trucks.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.677" offset="2322056">And I emphasize that because the District Court found that Shannon maintained a reasonable inventory of sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.019" offset="2351417">I'm not sure what the Court meant by reasonable but in fact, it's a small one.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.612" offset="2373778">Now, the hearing on this case took place in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.069" offset="2387675">In December 1, 1956, Shannon had inventory of a 123 100-pound bags.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.854" offset="2466774">We'll concede that he takes title of it at -- when he picks up the sugar at Supreme and that as the owner, he takes the risks which we say are minor, price fluctuations, and damage and transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.864" offset="2526856">We admit that he makes sales on credit, 10 days credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.035" offset="2547545">We admit that he is -- does not collect any identifiable or earmarked transportation charge from his customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.353" offset="2572831">He sells them at so much per 100 pounds with no earmark transportation charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.262" offset="2596446">And we conceive that he usually has no orders in advance of the purchase and transportation of the sugar.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.709" offset="2806157">So following it through between the two pages, we have a transaction in which Shannon is buying sugar on May 15 at Supreme, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.638" offset="2861955">Turning on the other page, he sells it in San Antonio on May 16 to Lawlor and Lawlor according to the record, is a wholesale grocer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.614" offset="6045863">I think -- I think that will be helpful because it was in the Transportation Act of 19 -- 1958 that Congress really focused on this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.220" offset="6096227">The language which -- which is the second clause of 203 (c) was sponsored in almost verbatim, its present form by the Transportation Association of America which is a distinguished organization of representatives of all modes of transportation, shippers, and academic world and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.076" offset="6179715">We put this forward as their approach to what they referred to as the problem for-hire transportation services performed by private carrier -- carriers through use of the so-called buy-and-sell technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.619" offset="6241886">Since this TAA proposal was almost verbatim, the amendment which Congress made the Section 203 (c), we think it's significant to see what TAA told Congress, through its amendment, would accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.604" offset="6297788">And then the Senate subcommittee hearings in 1957, TA -- TAA stated that our suggested alternative is aimed at the buy-and-sell practice employed by some pseudo-private carriers as an outright subterfuge to avoid regulation or as a means of making otherwise legal transportation service more profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.000" offset="6387336">And TAA said, "Our proposal for not affecting legitimate private carriers would affect the operations of the following types of carriers", and the third type, they listed was, "a third type would be the carrier who delivers his own goods in one direction as a legal private carrier but then resorts to the buy-and-sell practice to get a return load."</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.825" offset="6486706">And we say that that TAA third type fits Shannon like a hat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.193" offset="6508126">And I think it's significant that TAA has filed a brief as amicus curiae in this Court urging reversal of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.430" offset="6545115">And on the Senate and House, the Reports of the Senate and the House Committees focused with unusual specificity in this rather particularized problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.347" offset="6588792">Thus, the House Committee found that the erosion of the traffic of regulated carriers has also then caused to a considerable extent by the growth of pseudo-private carriage by truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.956" offset="6631215">And zeroing in on this case, the House Committee said, "Businesses which use their own trucks to deliver their own merchandize are purchasing goods at or near the final point of delivery of their own merchandize in transporting such goods to places near their own establishments for sales to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.711" offset="6698193">Such transportation is usually performed solely for the purpose of receiving compensation for the otherwise empty return of the trucks."</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.503" offset="6729435">There's more but it's in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.701" offset="6738213">The Senate Report was in exactly the same specific (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.678" offset="6758066">And so those are the reasons detailed on the Senate and House Reports as to why the last clause was added to 203 (c) in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.871" offset="6806862">That is, "Nor shall any person engaged in any other business enterprise transport property by motor vehicle in interstate or foreign commerce for business purposes unless such transportation is within the scope and in furtherance of a primary business enterprise other than transportation of such person."</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.163" offset="6888051">So the question here is whether Shannon's use of its backhaul capacity, the transportation of sugar is within the scope and in furtherance of a primary business enterprise other than transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.792" offset="6950536">Stated otherwise, how do we give a practical content to what Congress was clearly trying to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.262" offset="6976449">How do we give a practical content to this standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.728" offset="6990242">And at the same time, respectfully, equally clear congressional purpose of continuing to exempt a bona fide private carriage from federal economic regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.432" offset="7045099">We say that as a practical and real -- in a practical and realistic sense, Shannon's transportation of sugar is not in the scope in furtherance of a non-transportation enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.201" offset="7092224">The economic way or ideas, that is dealings in sugar are measured solely by his available backhaul capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.873" offset="7130885">He never utilizes the services of for-hire carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.784" offset="7150529">The economic reality is that his rapid resales during or immediately following the transportation of the sugar by eliminating all real market or warehousing risks or cost means that is only real investment in or contribution to a sugar enterprise is the otherwise empty backhaul capacity of these trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.502" offset="7241331">Of course, it cost him a little bit to extend credit for 10 days but that's the sort of noncontrolling indicia that this Court brushed aside in Drum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.042" offset="7279574">This Court in Drum said the fact that Drum paid social security for the owner operators was not enough to -- to change the -- the basic economic reality of what was going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.050" offset="10683538">Column 13 is an arithmetical computation by which we derive the number of 100-pound bags of sugar on each load.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.903" offset="10718960">So by reading column 13 on page 5, you can determine the amount of load in each of the shipments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2698.974" offset="10899310">If you scan this Exhibit 1, it shows a very -- I think the word remarkable is a fair word, remarkable sequence in that -- in these representative transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.417" offset="10973080">Shannon knew that he could load a truck at Supreme, Louisiana, 525 miles away from San Antonio with something between 31,000 and 37,500 pounds of sugar in 100-pound sacks and carry it to San Antonio and there deliver it to the receivers of the sugar and be paid for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.207" offset="11104214">That shows a complete understanding between Shannon and the receivers of the sugar that Shannon could perform a purely transportation operation on the backhaul, contribute nothing whatsoever to the sugar but as the economist would phrase it, a change of place, utility and do it regularly and smoothly, and methodically over a period of months to basically the same customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.860" offset="11258859">Now, on page 6 of our reply brief, we have set out the repetition of the same customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.865" offset="12210866">But when he finds himself with an empty truck more than 500 miles away from San Antonio, it is then he goes around to the refinery and buys the sugar and one or two days later, sells that in San Antonio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.322" offset="12284635">And we say, and the Committees of Congress said in reporting and recommending the 1958 Amendment of 203 (c) for passage said that that kind of thing is a transportation business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.684" offset="12346075">Now, the -- the Interstate Commerce Commission found that Shannon was in two kinds of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.165" offset="12371989">He was in a warehousing business at San Antonio where he handles feed, and salt, and livestock and a -- some -- had it maintained a very small inventory of sugar that Mr. Ginnane referred to, that is one business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.131" offset="12443878">Then the Commission found that he was engaged in a transportation business in the backhaul, in bringing the sugar back because this sugar that is represented in Exhibit 1 does not stop at the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.250" offset="12528410">In fact, on the only identifiable occasion in the record, when one of the receivers of the sugar for some reason that is not revealed, refused to take it, one of the person he thought was going to take it didn't take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.592" offset="12597791">Shannon did not have enough room in the warehouse to store the sugar so he had to put it in a public warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.513" offset="12629452">In other words, his business, his -- his primary business in San Antonio is not adapted to handling truck load sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.181" offset="12664142">He had to put it in a public warehouse and his testimony is in the record that he simply couldn't make any money that way on this transaction because of the loading and unloading charges and the public warehouse cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.949" offset="12715133">The -- the charges he had to pay for public warehousing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.497" offset="13781347">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.804" offset="13798588">The appellees understand the problems of the appellant carriers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.620" offset="13821889">They are regulated and argued to protect all of their rights which is certainly what they should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.084" offset="13843728">However, the appellees believe that the small businessman should not be made to sacrifice any of his rights just because or that the -- there should be any further granting of rights to the appellant carriers by taking them away from the small businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.640" offset="13937977">The appellees believe that they are in a general mercantile business and that certainly, they should be allowed and able to buy and sell their own products, transport those products in their own trucks and cannot imagine that Congress would have intended otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.923" offset="14011016">A very important case, as far as the appellees are concerned in this particular field is the Taylor versus Interstate Commerce Commission case which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.616" offset="14053857">In that particular case, a carrier bought some lumber, finished lumber in one state and transported it to retailers in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.374" offset="14100877">The retailers purchased an FOV of that particular state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.733" offset="14114356">They didn't know where the lumber came from, who owned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.783" offset="14130552">The carriers actually purchased the lumber under preexisting contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.980" offset="14159287">In other words, they wouldn't go out and buy the lumber until they had a sale for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.811" offset="14182588">The Court nevertheless held that the carriage was private.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.797" offset="14198575">But the reason that I mentioned that particular case at this particular time is that the Court discussed the congressional intention of the Motor Carrier Act and the Transportation Act in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.993" offset="14255313">The Interstate Commerce Commission in the case argued that it was a policy of Congress to require a liberal interpretation of the Act in favor of holding Taylor to be a contract carrier as opposed to a private carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.059" offset="14319574">The Court says that the word liberal in that connection was -- and the word it used was a weasel word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.922" offset="14355101">That the Court then quoted from the policy of the Act that it was the national transportation policy to provide impartial regulation of all modes of transportation to protect and to serve the inherent advantages of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.383" offset="14420929">And one of those modes of transportation that Congress evidently felt had inherent advantages is private carriage and that there should be no rule of interpretation more liberal for contract or common carriage on the one hand as for private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.240" offset="14496371">The Court even mentioned that the Congress has always desired to protect the smaller businessmen and for that purpose has even set up committees to study legislation therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.942" offset="14551124">So proceeding on the assumption that private carriage deserves at least as much protection by the courts as other forms of transportation, what are the particular facts in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.076" offset="14607653">The record clearly shows that as a result of the routine investigation, the hearing was held and ordered and the facts disclosed that the appellees were in the business of buying and selling many products, livestock in the feed mill business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.767" offset="14682467">They bought and sold corn, oats, wheat, bran, molasses, sugar, salt, fertilizers and everything in the feed line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.854" offset="14718830">It didn't say everything else in the feed line but everything in the feed line so that we quarrel that the attempted division of everything else in one category such as feed and sugar, separate in apart in another category because it --</text>

            <text syncTime="5370.655" offset="21586004">And I might mention that actually the Congress did not go as far as the recommended committee reports that were appended to the Interstate Commerce Commission report because the Senate Committee requested the use of the word solely in the Act that solely within the scope and in furtherance of a primary business and the Act was not passed without a word in it which would indicate to some extent, the intention of Congress when the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.667" offset="21706062">Also, the Interstate Commerce Commission and this is in the record in the case, argued to change the definition of private carrier which was not done and the Committee Reports specifically state that there was no intention to unsettle the primary business test which indicates to me that there was certainly no desire to change the law in any way, shape or form that it was but to try to codify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.686" offset="21806164">Now, whether it's made it clear or a more confusing of course is -- is another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.023" offset="21827480">I might mention this, may it please the Court and that is that when we're talking about volume, the evidence shows that there were 517 bags or 51,700 pounds of sugar in Shannon's inventory at the last inventory taking date immediately prior to this particular hearing which maybe considered a small amount or maybe considered a large amount but it's our position that that is a large amount of sugar considering the type of material and merchandises involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.903" offset="21954957">The only other reference to any number of pounds that is found in the record that I could find was the testimony of Mr. Whitehead (ph) who was the representative of the Bureau of Inquiry and Compliance, the investigator for the Interstate Commerce Commission and it's found on page 75 of the -- of the record where he states, "From my observation I went by the warehouse one time and the gentleman in charge was not there so I did not invade the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.266" offset="22056417">However, I did look in the front door and there were several thousand pounds of feed stuffs stored in that warehouse."</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.440" offset="22077106">That's the only comparison we have as to the amount of feed stuffs that he may have had as opposed to the amount of sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.289" offset="22096541">But I don't believe that the -- the specific amount is -- it's certainly a factor but it's not important at least to the extent that the record has shown that we have a considerable amount of sugar in the inventory and the record further discloses that frequent sales and less than carload lots are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.780" offset="22174490">And by examining the representative sales that are set out on Exhibit number 1 that was prepared by the Bureau of Inquiry and Compliance and introduced into evidence in this particular case from looking at the sales slips' numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.906" offset="22227048">It is obvious that less than a third of the sales that the -- Shannon made during this representative period of time were actually included in the Exhibit and even these particular sales show that Shannon was selling or obtaining approximately the market price for sugar in the San Antonio area.</text>

            <text syncTime="5780.993" offset="23227329">The appellants in their brief and in their argument state that the Court below exceeded its permissible limits of authority in deciding the case in the court below as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.115" offset="23283858">The appellees believe that the trial -- this is not a case where the trial court improperly substituted its own judgment for the administrative judgment but instead, the facts in the case are virtually undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.649" offset="23337984">The -- it is really a law question involved as to whether or not the primary business test as codified by Section 203 (c) is to be extended to a fact situation such as this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.591" offset="23393782">And if the -- it is not to be so extended, there is absolutely no evidence or at least there is no substantial evidence in the record to support that conclusion and the conclusion that was reached by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.088" offset="23447698">The appellees have said before and have said in their brief and will say it again that they certainly do not quarrel with the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission has done a -- an excellent job in this particular field, in the -- in the field of commerce nor that they do not always have the best of intentions in the filing of particular actions which they, under the law, are required to bring and file.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.657" offset="23541948">But no institution or agency is of course perfect and in a situation where with the best of intentions, an agency tries or attempts to regulate an individual and interfere with the -- a bona fide business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.275" offset="23612479">We feel that it is a duty of the courts to scrutinize the situation and with -- that is what the trial court did in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.035" offset="23655528">The appellants have cited several cases in their briefs in support of their position and the appellees have -- in their briefs have replied to those and will not go to the Court now by going into the various fact situations but there is one case, the Cahaba Steel case that was mentioned by Mr. Ginnane that was not referred to by the appellees in their brief mainly because we didn't have access to the loosely volume that it appeared in at the time that we wrote our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.448" offset="23777155">It is -- there's only a memorandum of opinion in the District Court and the only opinion that was printed in was the Interstate Commerce Commission opinion and we just obtained access to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.246" offset="23812368">But that was an entirely different situation from the facts insofar as this particular case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.122" offset="23839848">It involved the transportation of salt and in the first place, the examiner in that case found against Cahaba.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.029" offset="23871509">The second place, it was a situation where Cahaba had his offices in Alabama and sold steel joist products in the Texas and Louisiana area and while there, purchased salt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.035" offset="23935561">The invoices on the purchasers themselves showed that the seller of the salt in the Texas and Louisiana area gave a discount for the transport -- their normal transportation charge back to Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.443" offset="23997106">And further, there was a -- an evidence, a letter from the president of Cahaba where he admits that the profits from the sale of a salt haul back enabled it to compete with steel joist fabricators at the point of delivery in the steel products and the purchase of salt and admitted that the salt sales are essential to the operation of their trucks and the delivering of their steel products.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.603" offset="24093759">And there -- there is no evidence in the case at bar that the purchase of the sugar is essential for the appellees to make a profit from the sale of cattle or grain or their many other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.220" offset="24140257">The only evidence is that they buy the sugar to make a profit which is of course is -- is just a statement of a common sense since they wouldn't be a business to -- to buy it, to make a loss or at least they wouldn't intend to do that for very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.325" offset="24188635">The evidence does show that on occasion, Shannon has sent over empty trucks to Supreme, Louisiana and brought back sugar at a profit but that he -- at a particular time of the hearing, he was unable to do that because beet sugar from Canada and California was highly competitive in the area and depressing the market and he was unable to have made a profit insofar as the particular time of the hearing was concerned but that he had done it in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.154" offset="24316008">But certainly, it would not seem unreasonable for him to attempt to coordinate his transportation movements from the Texas area to the Louisiana area and back so as to obtain the maximum efficiency from the operation of his trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.541" offset="24433560">The appellees believe that it was not the intention of the Congress for individual such as in the case at bar to be unable to buy and sell products including sugar when they are and have been for many years in the general mercantile business with sugar being one of several commodities that they buy and sold nor is there any evidence whatsoever of any prearranged plans setup so that the real consignee may receive transportation at a reduced cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.033" offset="24555499">One case that was -- is relied on by the appellants very strongly is the Stickle case which was decided by two of the same three judges who decided the Clayton case, both these cases being cited in all the briefs in the -- in the -- before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.343" offset="24620701">The Clayton case had held private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6131.975" offset="24631254">The Stickle case held something other than private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.846" offset="24650794">But in the Stickle case the freight rates were the same as a profit that Stickle obtained for his sale of the lumber.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.658" offset="24682036">And lumber was the only item that was handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.852" offset="24690813">So that all that Stickle was really doing was buying freight under the guise of being in the lumber business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.937" offset="24719130">In the case at bar, the freight rate is entirely different and the only amount that the appellees received for their purchase and sale of sugar is the going of market profit in the San Antonio area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.219" offset="24788198">The appellees don't raise sugar so naturally, the cost of hauling it is an important factor to determine its margin of profit since they buy and sell but also important are storage cost, bookkeeping cost, bad debt expenses, inventory losses, loading, unloading -- unloading cost, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.840" offset="24874715">As previously stated to the Court, it would seem to boil down to a question of whether or not the appellees' operations are really a subterfuge and there is no evidence in the record that that this is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.297" offset="24920586">All the evidence shows is legitimate purchasing and sale of sugar and the examiner's finding would certainly seem to have great weight insofar as this is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.380" offset="24964890">If -- it would appear that unless all the evidence of the appellees is to be disbelieved that they are in the sugar business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.837" offset="24994670">How else could they buy and sell sugar when they don't raise it?</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.162" offset="25012015">They buy from the manufacturer, haul it to their place of business, take title in their own name, bear all the losses in connection with it, sell it on credit with bad -- with the attendant possible bad debt losses and in the interim period, they store the sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6242.006" offset="25071365">Must they haul by rail and pay those cost when they have their own trucks available for hauling and have had them available over the years for their complete operations starting with livestock and expanding to feedstock, grain, corn, molasses, salt, and now sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.499" offset="25149419">Nor are the appellees arguing that because they made no attempt to hide their operation that therefore there's no subterfuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6270.948" offset="25187140">Instead that when the congressional committees speak of bona fide merchandising ventures as opposed to prearranged plans being setup to enable the real consignee to receive transportation cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.098" offset="25243773">That more is meant than simply backhauling is not private carriage unless the particular party brings back goods with other means of transportation over and above his own trucks which is in effect what the appellants are arguing in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.822" offset="25330709">Instead, we submit that the entire record should be scrutinized and considered to determine if there is some prearranged plan between the real consignee and the hauler whereby the real consignee is only paying the hauler for the hauling itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6324.898" offset="25403016">The type of plan of course can be either expressed or implied from all the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.466" offset="25421197">We submit that this is a type of pseudo carriage or subterfuge that the appellees, submit is necessary to be found for the entire record to show something other than private carriage, and there is no evidence to raise any of these questions in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6348.599" offset="25497788">In their brief and our position to the appellees motion to dismiss the appeal or to affirm, the appellants in response to a question asked by the appellee concerning what more was necessary in order for a bona fide sugar merchant to be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.863" offset="25566856">And in reply to that, the appellants listed certain things that they felt should have been done in order for the appellees to have been bona fide sugar merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.200" offset="25608129">These included employing, commission salesmen or brokers to develop an expanded territory, to make large scale purchases of sugar, to deal in futures or engage in hedging operations or to deal in beet sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.559" offset="25673644">In the first place, it would not seem necessary for a firm to do any of these particular things in order to be a bona fide sugar merchant nor is there any evidence as to what Shannon does on his other lines that he carries where there's no question but that he's a bona fide merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6408.531" offset="25737488">In the second place, they do deal through a broker which is shown in the record of the case and they have a number of sugar customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.409" offset="25769044">Also, they purchase a considerable quantity of sugar considering the fact that it deteriorates very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.374" offset="25792867">It has a very small margin of profit and a very flexible price market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.073" offset="25815646">In the third place, there is no evidence in the record that the appellees failed to have done any of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.588" offset="25841768">And even under the substantial evidence rule, when a governmental agency wants to enjoin an individual from operating a place of business, it would seem that it would have the burden of getting into the record the certain things that it believes that either the individual does or fails to do that would indicate something other than private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6455.808" offset="25926614">Nor there should be a presumption that because the record is silent that that would mean that the individual has either done or failed to do something that is consistent with something other than private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6466.007" offset="25967365">The record shows that the appellees are in a general mercantile business selling many items including sugar that they sell it for the going market profit to a reasonably large number of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.665" offset="26014072">There's no evidence that there are any other sugar purchasers in San Antonio other than the -- who Shannon sells to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6484.085" offset="26039672">The record is silent as to that but that there's no evidence as to whether or not other -- how other people made to sell sugar in the San Antonio area whether they bring the sugar in by trucks, by common carriage, or whatever other method maybe available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.527" offset="26113442">The -- there is evidence in the record that at the price sugar was selling in San Antonio, at the particular time of the hearing that nobody could have afforded to have brought sugar over from Supreme, Louisiana and made a profit because there's no evidence that -- that Shannon was either buying the sugar cheaper at a great discount in the Louisiana area or that he was getting a higher profit in the San Antonio area and since the average profit is only 25 cents to 35 cents and the average freight rate is 68 cents or 69 cents for one mode of transportation at over a dollar for the other, evidently no one could have made a profit in the San Antonio area at that particular time because of the market price of sugar.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter C. Wolff, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6603.204" offset="26516146">Well, certainly all businesses to some extent are interrelated where the -- that is our position that hauling is just one of many items that go into the cost of a product, bookkeeping expenses, administrative salaries, salesmen's commissions or salesmen's cost and that those various factors all add together, bring out what an individual is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6627.609" offset="26613844">Certainly, if they return empty that -- let's assume that they do make some profit on the purchase and sale of sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6638.244" offset="26656371">On the other hand, assuming the other way, suppose they buy sugar at X number of dollars when they get back to San Antonio, it is worth only X-1 that they can sell it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.702" offset="26706213">Then they would have been better off to probably not to have brought -- not to have bring the sugar back because they don't get paid for the transportation as such in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.314" offset="26740590">They get paid only -- if they paid extra only if they make a profit on the sale of sugar when they bring it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="6671.455" offset="26789177">The record in the case shows that the appellees' are in a general mercantile business and that they sell at the going market profit to a reasonably large number of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6682.027" offset="26831496">How they obtain those customers either by advertising and appointing commission salesmen or some other method is not controlling unless the appellant believes that that is material to the case in which event, it should have been developed into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.132" offset="26887920">The other differences between the Stickle case and the case at bar are -- that it was -- that there was practically no lumber in Stickle's inventory as opposed to the appellee's sugar business which has a reasonably large amount of inventory considering the nature of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.827" offset="26958660">The principle assets of the company in the Stickle case and the payrolls of the company were tied up in transportation facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.961" offset="26999202">Most of Stickles lumber purchases and sales were to fill preexisting orders which is not the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.941" offset="27031176">Stickle sold only one item which was lumber and he had a freight bill with his name on it and the location and the name of the consignee on it and actually the word consignee was used and the consignee had to deliver to Stickle's driver a check for the amount of transportation charge which was shown on the freight bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.101" offset="27107767">In the case at bar, the appellees have a general mercantile business and sugar is only one line of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6758.059" offset="27135561">There's no consignee but a purchaser, no item or freight connected with the sales price in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="6765.621" offset="27165863">The appellants attached much importance to the fact that the appellees testified to the present market price of sugar in San Antonio, they couldn't properly at least send an empty truck for sugar and make a profit on the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6781.020" offset="27227408">It's the appellees' position that such a statement is not controlling even under the substantial evidence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6788.027" offset="27255515">The evidence show that the cost of the beet sugar's being brought to the San Antonio area at the time of the hearing that the market was highly competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.902" offset="27282996">And that the appellees' couldn't profitably send an empty truck to Louisiana and bring back sugar, but that they had done so on other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6804.343" offset="27320717">And certainly, it would be reasonable for any general mercantile business to attempt to coordinate their trucks so as to obtain maximum efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.619" offset="27397831">The appellants contend in Mr. Mathews -- in his argument that the appellees, Mr. Ginnane, I believe it was, that the appellees contribute nothing to the sugar other than its transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.670" offset="27446000">In the first place, they store some of the sugar, they load it, they unload it, they bear all the risk of loss and damage, they bear the risk of a declining market, they sell on credit and bear the risk of a bad debt loss, what other service is a sugar merchant supposed to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.454" offset="27529174">The appellee does not argue that the primary business doctrine is so broad that anything that it does in order to make it overall business less expensive to operate would be in furtherance to that overall business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6871.172" offset="27588106">But they do argue that the doctrine goes further that the Interstate Commerce Commission found in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.269" offset="27616423">As in the case of most fields of the laws, each case must be decided on its own facts and merits and those facts and by applying them to the law in the case at bar, the appellee submit that they are a private carrier of sugar under either of the -- a limited or a broader definition of primary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6899.715" offset="27702209">They certainly haul sugar in furtherance of their general mercantile business and because of the various factors that were found by the District Court in the case at bar, such as the relationship of transportation and non-transportation products, no preexisting orders, buying on the -- on the market price, selling for the going market price, and other factors that are previously have been mentioned in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.362" offset="27792802">They feel that they are in the primary business of buying and selling sugar under the narrow interpretation of the primary business test.</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.682" offset="27842121">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Amos M. Mathews</label>
            <text syncTime="6941.323" offset="27868662">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.063" offset="27871587">In the few minutes remaining, I want to catch on just three or four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="6946.935" offset="27891127">One of them is to haul particular attention to the Church Point Wholesale Beverage case that is cited in our -- all of our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.112" offset="27927803">That case analyzes the legislative history and gives a reason for the enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.439" offset="27953089">And it points out very clear analysis that if the statute of the 1958 Amendment is not given the application that the Commission and the other appellants here contend for, that there will be a very serious breakdown in the administration and enforcement of the Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6987.629" offset="28053922">And it explains why, because of the device of buy and sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="6994.308" offset="28080567">And it also points out that it present possible breakdown in the enforcement of the Motor Carrier Act toward which the -- which the 1958 was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7011.529" offset="28149530">Now, I want to also mention briefly that we do not believe the Universal Camera case is applicable here because here there is no dispute in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7020.357" offset="28184848">I mean the facts are -- there's no -- the -- they are just a certain set of facts that are not disputed and -- and there's no -- the only inferences are to be drawn from those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7033.246" offset="28236361">Now, if you will examine Exhibit 1 which as I say was reproduced in pages 4 and 5 of our reply brief and omits the last line which is a transfer -- which is a load to Laredo cases all of the rest are San Antonio and compute the average return or profits so-called for 100 pounds of sugar, it figures to 42 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="7064.565" offset="28361644">The evidence of a -- an expert witness is that the average profit in sugar in San Antonio at that time was 25 cents to 35 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="7073.389" offset="28396962">The carload rail rate at that time was 69 cents so the profit realized by Shannon from each -- from average profit was about midway between what wholesale dealers were making and what the freight rate was.</text>
            <text syncTime="7091.282" offset="28468537">In other words, he was rendering transportation at a reduced cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="7100.127" offset="28503855">Now, there's been some -- been some exchange of questions about whether there was an understanding between Shannon and the receivers of the sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="7113.930" offset="28559130">It seems perfectly clear that there must have been a clear understanding that the receivers would accept the sugar when it arrived in San Antonio that is exhibit -- that is shown by Exhibit 1 because Exhibit 1 shows a very successful enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="7132.915" offset="28634990">Purchase of sugar, and delivery, and every transaction was a profit.</text>

            <text syncTime="7144.818" offset="28682637">It might just show a very ready market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7148.323" offset="28696639">I suppose people like soft drink manufacturers and candy manufacturer are always been -- in the market for sugar at the right price --</text>

            <text syncTime="7176.278" offset="28808443">Now, reference was also -- some question was raised as to whether the amendment of 1958 applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="7185.665" offset="28846059">We cite the Ziffrin case, Ziffrin against United States in our briefs and it seems very clear to us that the -- under the clear holding of that case, the 1958 Amendment does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="7203.916" offset="28918993">I also want to call your attention to the point that is readily apparent in the briefs that many of the cases that have been cited by counsel for the appellee were decided before the 1958 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7220.691" offset="28986180">Now, the legislative history or the -- or the -- the excerpts from the committee reports are -- are attached to the Commission's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="7231.789" offset="29030484">Of course, they're readily available but a scanning of those will make it evident that pseudo -- so-called "pseudo-private" carriage was not the only target of the 1958 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7242.899" offset="29074996">It is perfectly clear -- I -- I don't have -- certainly don't have time to go into that, but it is perfectly clear that there were three things at which the amendment was aimed and a straight forward buy and sell arrangement was proscribed as here.</text>
