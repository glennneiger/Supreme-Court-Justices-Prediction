            <label>Mr. Orrick</label>
            <text syncTime="14.708" offset="162252">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.308" offset="176567">This case, a civil antitrust case, is here on appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.828" offset="210735">The jurisdiction of this Court is conferred by Section 2 of the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.281" offset="232469">The question presented by this case is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.122" offset="251904">After consent decree negotiations between the Government and appellees had reached an impasse, appellees requested the District Court to enter an injunction which was narrower than that sought by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.315" offset="312613">The difference between these two decrees turned on factual issues without a trial of any kind on those issues or indeed, on any of the issues framed by the pleadings and without the consent of the Government, the District Court entered the injunction proposed by the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.629" offset="397876">The question simply stated is whether the District Court erred and so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.806" offset="422640">The underlying facts are very briefly these, on March 6, 1961, two indictments were filed in the court below charging certain bakery companies with conduct which violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.184" offset="492126">In one indictment, all five appellees here were charged with combining and conspiring to allocate among themselves the business of supplying bread and rolls to federal naval installations in Jackson, Florida and submitting non-competitive and rigged bids and price quotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.805" offset="578644">In the second indictment, four of the five appellees here plus two other companies were charged with combining and conspiring to fix and maintain the prices in which they sold bakery products to nongovernment wholesale accounts which are defined as grocery stores, supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and similar large purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.374" offset="676864">All of the defendants in both criminal cases were convicted on their pleas of nolo contendere and fines were imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.023" offset="719496">Now, the case at bar, a civil action, was brought against all five of the defendants who had been convicted of fixing prices in connection with the sales to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.771" offset="774457">Four of whom, as I've previously stated, were also convicted of fixing prices on the nongovernment sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.761" offset="810402">The complaint asked for both damages and injunctive relief pertaining to the violations on sales to the Government and in addition, a request for whatever more general injunctive relief might be deemed appropriate after a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.904" offset="878947">Answers containing general denials were filed in due course and thereafter, consent decree negotiations were initiated by appellees with Government counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.718" offset="926281">These negotiations followed the normal course.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.428" offset="941119">The parties first negotiated a settlement of a count for damages and they have reached an agreement pursuant to which the parties paid -- agreed to pay the Government $44,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.435" offset="993155">At that time, the -- the appellees offered to take an injunction limited to the specific prayers set forth in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.990" offset="1043310">The Government, this was not satisfactory to the Government, and the Government proposed a broader injunction enjoining the defendants from price fixing with regard to sales to third parties and forbidding certain attempts to set the price on resale of the appellees' bakery products.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.080" offset="1123662">Counsel for the appellees refused to accept the Government's proposal and he then submitted a -- another proposal which was broader in scope than his first one and went beyond the scope of the prayers for relief in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.272" offset="1192417">Further attempts to negotiate, and they were a good many, which I won't detail, were fruitless and the negotiations reached an impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.061" offset="1239646">And just briefly, the Government wished two provisions to which the appellees would not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.606" offset="1265768">First, that they be enjoined from price fixing with regard to sales to third parties and second, that they be enjoined from setting the price on resale of their bakery products.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.722" offset="1318222">Appellees then filed a motion in the court below for entry of their first judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.428" offset="1341106">The Court issued an order to show cause why the judgment shouldn't be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.624" offset="1361899">Appellees then amended the motion to have the Court enter their broader proposal and a hearing was held on this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.471" offset="1405262">At the hearing, the Court was advised by counsel for both sides of the nature of the impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.747" offset="1446327">And he was advised by counsel for the Government that at the trial and at the hearing on relief, the Government would bring in evidence to support its broader decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.761" offset="1502438">Now, the understanding of the Court and counsel for the appellees seemed to be that if the Court entered appellees' proposed decree, the Government did not have a right to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.507" offset="1569416">But if the Court decided to enter the Government's proposed decree, then the appellees would have the right to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.448" offset="1605151">I'd -- I would call the Court's attention to this unusual situations, which is in the Government's brief reproduced in a footnote at page 33, and I just briefly summarize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.982" offset="1667323">The Court says, "Let me say this now, that I'm going to enter your decree or the Government's decree."</text>
            <text syncTime="398.943" offset="1699192">One say, "I'm going to enter a decree here.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.061" offset="1719568">I'm not just going to enter an order after this 30-day expires saying we'd better go on to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.638" offset="1745899">Is that understood?"</text>
            <text syncTime="412.518" offset="1753422">Counsel for both side said, "No, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="415.107" offset="1763767">And then the counsel for the appellees went on and he said, "We did not agree that we were foreclosed from a right to go to trial if you decided to enter the Government's decree."</text>
            <text syncTime="429.709" offset="1822177">Now, I -- I agree that the appellees were correct in asking for their day in Court and that's just what we're asking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.190" offset="1860106">The Court then, on December 10 of 1962, entered as a final judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.633" offset="1889886">The defendant second proposed judgment was modified in certain respects at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.961" offset="1919248">And I -- the judgment on its face recites that it was entered and I quote, "Without trial or adjudication of any of the issues of factory law and before the taking of any testimony", and upon the appellees' motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.879" offset="1994898">And so the Government, in a suit brought by the Attorney General, to vindicate public rights, winds up with a decree which it doesn't like even though it is neither consented to the entry of that decree nor been provided with a litigants' basic right to make the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.422" offset="2085073">And now, as the Court please --</text>

            <text syncTime="552.128" offset="2311920">This Court recognized this in the U.S. Gypsum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.850" offset="2330728">But the Government here, I want to make clear, doesn't ask the Court to order entry of its proposed judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.496" offset="2365315">And indeed, the Government's complaint is that it has no record on which to base such a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.452" offset="2389138">That's the striking feature of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.623" offset="2401886">Instead, the Government asked that the District Court's judgment be vacated and the case be remanded for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.531" offset="2433546">Now the issue here is of great practical importance in the administration of the antitrust law.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.688" offset="2766137">But the -- the issue is very, very important in antitrust administration because more than 80% of our cases in fiscal year 1963, civil cases were settled by this -- by consent decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.538" offset="2829563">And the disposition of cases by these decrees has -- and the Court is well aware, it saves large expenditures of time, energy and money including the time and energy of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.550" offset="2881599">And the possible savings are often a factor in determining what relief by way of consent decree the Government may accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.014" offset="2923395">And I have no doubt that use by the courts of consent decree negotiations as a basis for entering a decree without a trial and without the consent of the Government would quickly tend to inhibit our negotiations in future cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.909" offset="5794983">Section 5 (a) was added to it, was in the Clayton Act in 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.012" offset="5823404">And it is designed to assist in the administration of the antitrust laws and the section of the statute is set out at page 2 of our brief and briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.292" offset="5876590">Section (a) says that a final judgment or decree rendered in any civil or criminal proceedings brought by the United States under the antitrust laws to the effect that a defendant had violated said laws, shall be prima facie evidence against such defendant in any action or proceeding brought by any other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.586" offset="5961749">That's clear enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.566" offset="5965615">Now then the proviso, which appellees, I think erroneously construe, provides that this section shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.242" offset="6036355">Now, appellees cite this section as -- they call it on page 16 of their brief, a sanctuary for antitrust violators, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.281" offset="6092466">And this, in the light of the legislative history, where this section was added to -- by an aroused -- at -- at the instance of an aroused President Wilson and an aroused Congress to get more effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.895" offset="6166967">There's nothing, I submit, in the legislative history to support any such assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.986" offset="6191313">But as I pointed out, it doesn't give them the double privilege, surely, of rejecting the pretrial consent judgment which is proffered by the Government and then at the same time avoid an adjudication on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.215" offset="6256201">Now, I will tell you conscientiously that we have tried to ascertain the basic -- the reasoning behind this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.819" offset="6330598">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.767" offset="6346480">I would like to make a few statements in regard to the facts before, if I may, before we get into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.794" offset="6386500">I take issue with my friend, Mr. Orrick, on what -- how this got before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.272" offset="6420459">It's very clear that after there was a pretrial hearing, at which this dispute between the Government and the private parties was outlined and the affidavit was filed outlining these procedures to give the Court the factual background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.852" offset="6494751">At that hearing, the Government tendered a proposed judgment and so did the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.833" offset="6522755">And at that hearing, the Government -- the Court issued a rule nisi which told in effect to the Government, "If you've got any proof, if you've got any legal -- any points about that I don't have power, bring them in."</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.713" offset="6578239">And what did the Government do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.944" offset="6587120">The Government absolutely did not file anything showing that they had any facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.285" offset="6612511">As a matter of fact, although Mr. Orrick said they didn't refuse to in effect they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.913" offset="6631006">And they took this position, and I call this to your attention, it was in the brief filed after the last hearing in June, in the record on page 122 in their brief filed in July of 1962, and this is a position they took.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.072" offset="6687640">The defendants here argued, if the Government had admissible evidence going beyond the facts plead, showing a legal need for broader relief then it should have set this out specifically in answer to the rule nisi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.116" offset="6743855">But the simple answer to this argument is that the Government was under no duty to reveal all of its evidence and answer to the rule nisi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.323" offset="6776665">It didn't reveal any evidence that it had any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.132" offset="6787950">They've consistently taken the position that the Court didn't have power to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.398" offset="6808952">And as I see it, and I'll go into this a little bit later, that if you follow their position to its logical extreme, you have here the Government saying, "You don't have power to act to see if your actions are arbitrary because you don't have a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.430" offset="6869138">And we're not going to give you the facts to give you the record, therefore, you don't have power to act", which I think is an erosion of the District Court's judicial power to determine whether or not the action is arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.106" offset="6915845">We didn't ask them to show all the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.020" offset="6923473">All they wanted to show was facts that would show there was a triable issue on this question of relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.234" offset="7048338">But the fact is that, this is a decree that we say is entered under the equity power of the Court and also permitted under Rule 83 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.489" offset="7085328">But if you go back to the strict definition of consent decree, I would not say so.</text>
