            <label>Mr. Francis M. Shea</label>
            <text syncTime="18.808" offset="178552">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.073" offset="191613">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.717" offset="226200">The basic questions presented are whether it was error in the District Court to admit evidence which we assert was the fruit of an unlawful search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment and secondly, although the defendant, petitioner here, enjoyed the assistance of counsel required by the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.156" offset="376038">The facts are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.997" offset="399339">Police, two police cruisers received a message from headquarters that three men in a Buick car were sitting on a street at New Port Kentucky and had been sitting there for some five hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.650" offset="494007">One of the men had left the car and then came back to it and they were instructed to go and investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.377" offset="536848">They went to the scene and found there three men, I think one was standing beside the car and the other two in it, this was at 3 o'clock in the morning, in the business district, they were parked right in the neighborhood of a night club, the marquee of which was still lighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.596" offset="649801">They ordered the men out of the car and frisked them for weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.226" offset="684283">They then interrogated them and discovered that none of them were employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.958" offset="715212">One had been without employment for some six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.640" offset="741961">One of the persons, Sykes said that he had bought the Buick car the day before, but he didn't have title papers with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.543" offset="797550">They had $0.25 cents between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.596" offset="821791">Their responses to questions the police said were evasive, but this is not particularized in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.964" offset="867244">They said they were there waiting for a person named Saxton, who is coming in on a trailer truck from a town some hundred miles away and who it was believed could help Strunk and petitioner to find employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.460" offset="969226">They couldn't inform the officers as to the company that Saxton worked for and of the kind of truck he was driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.599" offset="1017814">In response to the question of how they would recognize him, Sykes said that he normally stopped for a cup of coffee about a block down from where they were parked and in response to the question of why they weren't parked down there; the police thought that they gave evasive answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.045" offset="1143515">On this basis they were arrested, they were taken to the police station in one of the cruisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.779" offset="1186461">The Buick car was driven to the police station and then towed to a nearby parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.562" offset="1225644">At the police station the police commenced their interrogation. Sykes asked permission to go to the car to get some cigarettes, he was denied permission, but the officers then went down to search the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.876" offset="1306833">There is no suggestion that this was at the request of Sykes or with his permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.569" offset="1337657">In searching the car they found in the glove compartment two loaded revolvers.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.414" offset="1369004">They attempted to open the trunk of the car but were unable to with the keys they had taken from Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.587" offset="1401710">They returned then to the station and one of the detectives, Chapiarni sent Doxson, one of the uniformed officers down to see if he could get into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.598" offset="1473808">Doxson with the aid of the persons at the parking lot, pulled out the back seat, removed the partition between the back seat and the trunk and found there, two women's stockings, knotted at the top and one of them with eye holes in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.147" offset="1591986">Four caps, two of them split in the back, two lengths of rope, a piece of fishing line, a false Kentucky license with hooks that catch, that could be slipped over and hung on to another plate and two pair of gloves.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.214" offset="1720195">They then proceed with their interrogation and Sykes confessed that he and two others, but not Strunk or petitioner, had planned to rob the bank at Berry, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.251" offset="1820400">At this point they called in the FBI, because it was a federally insured bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.092" offset="1859688">They had lodged when they found the revolvers a further charge of carrying concealed and deadly weapons, but neither -- and when they came to the station initially they booked the three for vagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.931" offset="1963133">The vagrancy charge and the charge of carrying concealed weapons so far as the record discloses where never tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.952" offset="2023215">Some functionary of the local court said they were adopted by the federal prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.908" offset="2059055">So they were brought to trial on a charge of conspiring to rob a federally insured bank and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.552" offset="2125615">These I think are the facts pertinent to the issues which are before you, but I might note that at the trial the only evidence against petitioner was the testimony of a bartender that he had heard a conversation between petitioner and Strunk and Sykes that they had a big job on.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.358" offset="2224776">On cross examination, he said that he didn't whether that was installing a large furnace or what it might have been and the shopkeeper in Berry said that he had seen Sykes and he could pretty well identify petitioner driving slowly through the town and carefully looking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.549" offset="2329579">And there was the testimony of an FBI agent that petitioner had admitted to him that he had talked about robbing the bank at Berry, it was in a preliminary stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.091" offset="2411708">Petitioner testified he never talked about any bani in Berry.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.436" offset="2429158">What he had said was -- what he had meant by preliminary talk was that Sykes had come in to him and Strunk had said that he had a chance of making $5,000 and Strunk had said well that must be robbing a bank and he said, how did you know, and at that point Strunk said, well I just don't want to hear anymore about it (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="610.084" offset="2543679">On this evidence and the evidence in question here, petitioner was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.786" offset="2594565">The Solicitor General has expressed concern that as to whether or not this evidence was sufficient to go to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.600" offset="2649736">I share his concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.645" offset="2661961">That question is open to this Court if it chooses to deal with it, but I assume certiorari was granted to deal without the question and I turned to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.427" offset="2717132">In our original brief, we addressed ourselves to what we had supposed and still believe was the statute on the basis of which these men were arrested for vagrancy and the Court will find that setout on page three of our initial brief and with your indulgence I should like to read it with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.648" offset="2873971">Any person guilty of being a vagrant shall to the first offense be fined $10 or imprisoned for 30 days or both, for the second and each subsequent offence he shall be imprisoned for 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.089" offset="2951711">Vagrant is used in subsection 1 of this section and KRS 436530 means, any able bodied male person who habitually, habitually loiters or rambles about without means to support himself and who has no occupation at which to earn an honest livelihood or any able bodied male person without visible means of support who habitually fails to engage in honest labor for his own support, support of his family if he has one or any idle and dissolute able bodied male person who purposely desserts his wife or children be any of them without suitable subsistence, suitable means of subsistence, or any able bodied person without visible means of support who habitually refuses to work and who habitually loiters on the streets or public places of any city.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis M. Shea</label>
            <text syncTime="789.575" offset="3261628">I should think that was public.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.750" offset="3282422">In our initial brief, we argued that under this statute certainly there was no probable cause for arrest because these officers knew nothing of these men prior to the time they encountered them on this occasion on the streets of New Port and therefore there could be no possible basis for them to conclude that there was probable cause of the violation of this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.324" offset="3472697">The Solicitor General now concedes that that is the case and so this ordinance is out of the case, but he retreats to other ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.016" offset="3551483">He says that, this statute, he says there is an ordinance of the City of New Port and if that ordinance is also a vagrancy law and that the police might just as well have had in mind the New Port ordinance as the state statute and if there is any doubt about that the burden was on the petitioner to clarify that doubt in the court below and therefore he, the Solicitor General, may defend on the ground that the arrest was under the ordinance, and there was probable cause to conclude that there was a violation of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.261" offset="3804453">And then he says further that even if this isn't so, even if the arrest was not under the ordinance, nevertheless if there was some statute which if the police had any in mind at the time of arrest, would have furnished probable cause for the arrest even if they didn't have that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.887" offset="3982921">The Solicitor General may now rely on those laws to justify the arrest and he says that there are two sets of laws, that there was reasonable cause to believe, that the automobile was stolen and there was the reasonable cause to believe that the New Port Ordinance had been violated and lastly he says that even if he can't justify this search and seizure as incident to a valid arrest, nevertheless there was probable cause to believe that the automobile was stolen that in itself would justify a search without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.146" offset="4199946">Let me address myself to each of these contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.106" offset="4227845">First he contends, as I suggested, that he can rely on that New Port Ordinance, but that may have been what the officer had in my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.549" offset="4285524">Let me ask the Court again to indulge me in reading with you the terms of that ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.777" offset="4326484">It is setout on page two of the Solicitor General's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.226" offset="4360234">It reads “loitering, loitering penalty,” “that it shall be unlawful for any person not having a illegitimate business or visible means of support to in an idle, dissolute, disreputable, or eloping way to loiter around the streets within the limits of the City of New Port and any person so offending shall be on conviction thereof fined any sum not exceeding $15.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.614" offset="4525850">I should like ask Your Honors to know that the vagrancy statute of the State of Kentucky and this ordinance are fundamentally different pieces of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.660" offset="4605994">The state statute punishes for a status crime, not for an act or omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.914" offset="4647058">It's for the habitual doing of things, the character that the man has assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.550" offset="4689586">The ordinance punishes for an act so that we are not dealing with fungible goods, we are dealing with fundamentally different legal provision. Now, if the Court please, these men, according to the testimony of each of the officers who testified, were arrested for vagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.564" offset="4837648">They were booked for vagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.569" offset="4853635">The prosecutor tried the case in terms of vagrancy. Petitioners counsel sought to establish that they weren't vagrants within the meaning of the Kentucky Statute and when the Solicitor General filed his brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari, he argued on the basis of the Kentucky statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.005" offset="5003368">I suggest to the Court that the statute of Kentucky says on its face vagrancy, the ordinance says on its face loitering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.040" offset="5075571">Now there are interchangeable words in it too, but it seems to me that so far as anything in this record would permit us to determine which law the police were relying on, it is the vagrancy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.438" offset="5165119">Let me address myself to the point that it was petitioner's burden to get this clarified below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1287.967" offset="5255189">If I understand correctly the disposition of this Court on the matter, the statement of this Court in Jeffers, the statement of this Court in Jones, the rule is that you must have a warrant to arrest or search and seize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.306" offset="5376606">There are exceptions, but the general rule is zealously guarded and whoever relies on an exception has the burden of establishing the applicability of the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.659" offset="5442017">It seems to me this suggests if there was any ambiguity, it was the government's burden and not ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.379" offset="5472841">Moreover counsel for the petitioner did it seems to me all he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.116" offset="5491858">He asked these officers on the stand what they charged these men with and they said vagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.183" offset="5528116">It was the prosecutor who knew what it was they had in mind and he thought that there was ambiguity or that defense counsel were be mislead, it seemed to me he had a clear obligation to clarify.</text>

            <text syncTime="1403.020" offset="5715466">So that it seems to me that this is a not a ground on which the government can properly rely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.961" offset="5863215">Now, what the government tries to say is well the ordinance of vagrancy too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.454" offset="5885158">Let me turn to this second point which the government makes and that is that even though the officers arrested under the vagrancy statute of the state, nevertheless if there is some law under which they might have arrested, which would have given them probable cause to believe that, that law had been violated, they may now rely on that to sustain the validity of the arrest, and first they say that there was probable cause to believe that the car was stolen and secondly probable cause to believe that the new Court ordinance was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.682" offset="6142098">Well of course this was the question left open in the Reed, but if I read accurately the decisions of this Court it seems to me a point which was foreclosed in Jones and in Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.514" offset="6217435">Moreover, the government asserts and I suppose rightly with an exception that I think is not pertinent here, that the validity of the arrest by a state officer under a state statute is to be tested by state law and in four cases which we have cited to you, the highest court of the State of Kentucky has held in false arrest cases, that where the police arrest on one ground and Kentucky has a notice provision requiring them to inform the defendant of the ground of the arrest, where the police arrests on one ground they may not subsequently justify on the basis of a different ground or a different law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.578" offset="6485661">So it seems to me that counsel in this regard is leaning on rather a weak ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.175" offset="6532054">Now let me assume that he can rely on these two other laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.849" offset="6594748">He asserts that though the statute of Kentucky provides that an arrest maybe made for a public offence if committed in the presence of the officer or for a felony if there was reasonable cause to believe, which sounds certainly very much like the common law provision, he asserts that this has been construed by the courts of Kentucky to mean that in the case of a misdemeanor such is a violation of a vagrancy or a loitering statute, that the arrest maybe validly made if done in good faith, with probable cause to believe and where the probable cause derived from his senses or admissions of the defendants but not third parties and I think he has some authority to this, I think it's a doubtful area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.540" offset="6869556">I'm not going to address myself to it, the reasons for the doubts are set out in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.857" offset="6898813">I'm going to assume for these purposes that if there was probable cause to believe the arrest could be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.006" offset="6943431">Let me address myself first to probably cause to believe the car was stolen, the evidence was that Sykes was at the wheel of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.793" offset="7002572">He said he had bought it the day before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.160" offset="7020022">He didn't have title papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.347" offset="7032769">It was sitting in the middle of Newport, where one would hardly expect a person who had stolen a car to leave it or to sit in it, the most obvious place for apprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.171" offset="7108106">The things that are not said in the record are even more critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.435" offset="7129109">No suggestion that there had been any report from headquarters of the stolen car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.890" offset="7154918">No suggestion, even though the officers had been informed from the who the car had been bought, that they made any effort to check whether it had or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.405" offset="7204968">It seems to me on this record the Solicitor General has a very considerable burden to bear, to persuade this Court that there was probable cause to arrest on the grounds that the car had been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.552" offset="7285530">Secondly, let me turn to question of whether there was probable cause to believe that this ordinance of Kentucky had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.615" offset="7337880">There is nothing in the record to suggest that the officers had reasonable grounds to believe that these persons had no legitimate business unless that means that they were unemployed or if they had any visible means of support whatever that maybe, some of the courts accept it's not enough to establish that you have money in your pocket or money you derived from begging, but it is enough if it's derived from gambling, what that means I don't know, but in any event no effort to establish it, nothing to show that they were idle, dissolute, disreputable, loafing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.097" offset="7595760">I suppose what I'm basically saying is that under an ordinance as vague as this, even if the effort had been made and the effort was not made, it would be impossible to show probable cause for the arrest and this carries this into the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.122" offset="7711848">I defy any intelligent man that if that be the test to know whether he was or wasn't committing a crime under these vague words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.373" offset="7780916">The Solicitor General concedes that there is a good deal of vagueness at the periphery, but they suggest that at the core of this ordinance, there is a hardcore with adequate definition to support it against a charge of unconstitutional vagueness and this hardcore, to use their words, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.866" offset="7954787">“Just ordinary standing or sitting,” this is on page 19 in this brief on the footnote, “just ordinary standing or sitting is not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.555" offset="8005569">Loitering in a suspicious manner on the other hand satisfied this element of the crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.005" offset="8051440">As I read this, it makes the officer's state of mind, the petitioner's crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.526" offset="8097520">I don't know what else, where else you get suspicion expect in the officer's mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.421" offset="9249102">They didn't have reasonable grounds to believe a crime was committed if this ordinance is unconstitutional, it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.983" offset="9943333">I take it that Harris and Rabinowitz mark the outer limits of the premise and I have no need to attack those cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.369" offset="9992861">I take it that they say at most you must confine yourself to a search for the fruits of crimes or the instruments for its commission or means of escape or harm to the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.517" offset="10077393">Now what are the fruits of the crime of vagrancy for which they were searching, what are the instruments for its commission for which they are searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.906" offset="10134967">I suggest that there can't be any justification on those grounds and the government, seeing the difficulty of that position, suggests that not only have they justified searching for the fruits of the crime for which they have arrested, the instruments for its commission, but the fruits or instruments for commission of related crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.472" offset="10265266">They have not cited authority to the proposition and it seems to me what this means is the thing which was most directly condemned by the Fourth Amendment in the case of an arrest on suspicion or for vagrancy a general search without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.336" offset="10368711">Now, let me turn to the question of reasonableness of the search assuming that there was probable cause to believe the car was stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.114" offset="10411865">I take it that would have justified seizure of the car, but here was the car in parking lot, no chance of it ever being moved, we don't have any Carroll situation, under the complete dominion of the police and the question is could they in most circumstances ransack that car without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.183" offset="10540074">Now, I take it that Rabinowitz in overruling earlier cases said that the practicability of getting a warrant was not controlling, but I don't understand to say that it isn't relevant and indeed the strong statements of this Court, especially of the statement in Jones, the strong statements of this Court that the rule is a warrant, a rule zealously guarded and that you are going to part from the law you must justify yourself on the basis of bringing yourself carefully with an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.082" offset="10751666">I would suppose this suggests that where it's practicable, there is not difficulty about seeking a warrant and there are no considerations as there are none in this case to suggest the necessity of proceeding without a warrant, that a warrant is required and so I suggest to the Court that even if the arrest on the grounds of probable cause to believe that the car was stolen wouldn't have justified ransacking it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.371" offset="10896906">Certainly you weren't likely in the trunk the means of stealing the car or the fruits, the fruits of the car itself what you could find with evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.565" offset="12037622">The issue is whether the Fourth Amendment forbids the use in evidence in a Federal case of evidence obtained by state officers as a consequence of the 3 a.m. search primarily of the glove compartment of an automobile which had been parked on a city street for five hours after the officers went out and interrogated the men in response to a complaint of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.373" offset="12200835">Now we believe that this search which was conducted was reasonable and we make three – there are three reasons why we make that contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.465" offset="12689220">Certainly, the police when they went to scene didn't arrest just these men because they were unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.876" offset="12718895">They arrested them because they were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.858" offset="12738853">They didn't have title papers to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.470" offset="12749302">They gave an explanation which was completely evasive and improbable as to why they were there.</text>

            <text syncTime="6340.920" offset="25467068">No, I don't mean -- what I want I'm trying to say is, if you look from a point of view, suppose you had an ordinary citizen and he is arrested under suspicious circumstance, he doesn't have his title papers of car and the police wanted to conduct an examination, they want to examine the car to determine whether or not this is his car, they can't readily conduct it any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.608" offset="25581798">So I don't know whether it's -- it would be more -- if a State, if the State says, we will authorize the search of the glove compartment to see whether or not there is anything in the glove compartment which is to substantiate his ownership and then let him go on his way, which is more of an invasion, is it more of an invasion to have the -- to permit a limited search of the car, or is it more of an invasion to seize and impound the car?</text>

            <text syncTime="6413.962" offset="25759222">So, if you had done that perhaps at the scene of the arrest, it might have been one thing, but here you have closed that door.</text>

            <text syncTime="6440.257" offset="25864443">Now I understood you did say in response to Mr. Justice Clark's question that if there had been a substantial period of time elapsed between the time that they put these men in jail and the time they went down to search the car that if they would of necessity have to have the search warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="6602.424" offset="26513115">This Court knows in many cases where the lawyers were not appointed, defendants choose, defendants choose to have a joint counsel and sometimes you are much better off with joint counsel at least with joint counsel you don't have one lawyer pulling in one direction and another lawyer pulling in another direction and that in this situation where the trial lawyer who talked to these individuals didn't see anything in their circumstances to one separate counsel, I don't think that you can say that as a matter of law certainly when this is raised below -- last stage is that they should have a separate counsel.</text>
