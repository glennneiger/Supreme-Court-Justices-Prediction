            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="31.742" offset="230379">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.516" offset="249396">This cause is here for the fourth time and what petitioner hopes at the final time.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.889" offset="286908">On this occasion, the petitioner seeks to have a review of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama which refused to decide on the merits, the validity of an injunction, a permanent injunction issued against the petitioner which in effect ousted it from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.260" offset="380426">We're also seeking and asking this Court to decide this controversy on the merits because in view of the nature of the -- the claims that petitioner is making and the protracted nature of the cause itself, we think that the issue ought to be settled and settled final.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.760" offset="474363">The cause began in June 1, 1956 with the issuance of a temporary restraining order and injunction by the Circuit Court of Montgomery County in Alabama which barred the petitioner from operating, functioning or soliciting memberships in the State on -- on -- by virtue of a complaint which had been filed by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.510" offset="605393">The injunction was issued without notice and without hearing, as far as petitioner was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.039" offset="659519">And the injunction not only barred and ousted the petitioner from the State but barred it from attempting to comply with the statutes of Alabama which purportedly were the basis upon which the complaint had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.317" offset="728691">The burden of the complaint, the original complaint which was filed, was that petitioner was doing business and operating in Alabama without -- as a foreign corporation without registering.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.957" offset="779160">And that -- in essence, I think it's fair to say that the complaint really alleged that petitioner was in the business of -- of doing things for -- in the field of race relations, two of which were named, one, the support of the admission of Authurine Lucy to the University of Alabama and the other, the support of a boycott of the buses in -- by Negroes in Montgomery on the -- to attempt to have equal treatment for Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.020" offset="915414">That the petitioner was in the business of race relations and that this was -- was constituting irreparable injury to Alabama because it had not registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.867" offset="966823">The first occasion on which this cause reached here was on a collateral matter, on the issue of -- of a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.231" offset="996289">At that point, the State ordered the petitioner to produce various things including the -- the names and addresses of its members, petitioner refused with the judge in contempt, the cause reached here, this Court reversed in a decision which was handed down in June of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.343" offset="1076746">Cause came here a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.612" offset="1085837">And the decision of this Court in June of 1959, when the Supreme Court of Alabama reaffirmed the judgment below, the judgment of contempt on the grounds that although petitioner could not be held to be in contempt for refusing to produce his membership list, it had not complied with other portions of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.510" offset="1173400">This Court held that the matter had been adjudicated and presented here as if the only question before the Court was the question of the validity of the petitioner's refusal to give up its membership list and that having considered that, that the question, the Alabama court could not, therefore, affirm on the grounds that there were other portions of the order which had not been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.208" offset="1300250">The Alabama Supreme Court on the second remand of this cause, held the cause without sending it down to the lower court for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.454" offset="1341210">So the petitioner was frustrated in its attempt to secure a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.558" offset="1353644">And in June of 1960, petitioner's sought to have a trial of the issue in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.897" offset="1398993">That cause reached here in the October term 1961 and that time the -- this Court granted the petition for writ certiorari and ordered the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to instruct the District Court to proceed with the trial of this cause unless a trial on the merits have been accorded by the petitioner by June -- January the 2nd, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.381" offset="1528874">The Circuit Court, thereupon, granted petitioner a hearing on the merits in December 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.500" offset="1577357">When the hearing was concluded on December the 29th, the temporary restraining order was made permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.847" offset="1606719">In fact, there are some minor deviations but the substance was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.047" offset="1631587">And an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Alabama, Supreme Court of Alabama took the view that petitioner had not complied with one of its rules of procedure that its argument section of its brief -- brief was so at variance with Alabama's procedure that it could not review the matter on the merits because various assignments of errors which were not related had been argued together and therefore, under -- under the Alabama rules, that they argued together and one is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.096" offset="1779754">The Supreme Court indicated that it would not consider any of the assignments of error alleged and therefore, it --</text>

            <text syncTime="470.077" offset="1983718">Now, we take the view here that the Alabama's procedural ground in the Supreme Court of Alabama is mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.014" offset="2043382">One, we think that the deviations from the procedure that it now seeks to bar review on the merits of the petitioner, but deviations are such in Alabama procedure that we think that we can say to the Court with confidence that the parties from this are really a regular part of Alabama procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.875" offset="2138885">In other words, that all the Alabama says that Rule 9 must be complied with which it relied on here to dismiss the -- the brief without cause, without breaching the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.881" offset="2194892">It has held in case after case, that even though the rules are not complied with, that the rules are merely directory, that they are not jurisdictional and that the Court will go to the merits of the cause and we have cited both in our petition and in our brief on the merits, a large number of cases which -- in which Alabama has done this -- this -- it has followed this practice in many, many cases, so that our -- our first point that this can't obtain is the fact that we think the regular procedure of Alabama is in fact to go to the merits of the cause even -- even assuming that there has been a violation of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.356" offset="2384750">We also urge the Court that the -- the basis upon which the Supreme Court of Alabama refused to go to the merits of this cause is a really a triviality.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.708" offset="2434173">It's at best a practice which is outmoded and a ritual.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.125" offset="2463848">We think that it is clear that with all of the many times that this case was before the Supreme Court of Alabama, that the brief and the cause itself, the Court was -- was reasonably familiar with what the issues were and that it cannot be said that it did not know what petitioner was attempting to press.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.587" offset="2569697">So the -- our theory is that under the rules of this Court that the basis upon which Alabama sought to bar review by this Court cannot be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.335" offset="2624763">We think, therefore, that the cause is here on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.717" offset="2646288">And we will now address our -- we'll now address myself to the merits of the cause which I think -- we think is before the Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="698.815" offset="2898631">Now, we, insofar as petitioner's contention is in -- in regard to the merits of the cause, we think that there is no evidentiary basis in this record upon which the judgment and decree ousting petitioner from the State of Alabama could -- could possibly be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.909" offset="2994970">We suggest to the Court that there are two or three grounds which the -- which had been alleged, which may arguably have a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.738" offset="3058291">The first ground is that we did not comply with the foreign registration statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.778" offset="3078457">We concede that we did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.386" offset="3092877">The other grounds are that -- that they have alleged and the only allegations that have been made is one that petitioner assisted an individual, Authurine Lucy, in legal counsel to attempt to secure her admission to the University of Alabama, we would think that that would be foreclosed as a basis for ouster under the decision of this Court in NAACP versus Button.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.579" offset="3209697">The question of our assistance to Martin Luther King and the Negroes in -- in Montgomery, Alabama in their attempt to bring pressure to bear on the bus company to secure the end of discrimination in the seating and arrangements on the buses, we think that one, that this Court has held in Browder versus Gayle on -- on the same issue that segregation in intrastate commerce assort to -- to a state law is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.827" offset="3346683">And we think that even assuming, that the -- there is any basis in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.840" offset="3374686">The -- Dr. King was convicted of the charge under state law and the -- his conviction was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.170" offset="3408018">But our contention is that the giving of moral support, legal counsel cannot be a basis upon which the -- the State of Alabama can justify an ouster.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.136" offset="3463920">In their amended complaint, which I think is on pages 14 and 15, the State sets forth a number of grounds alleging that petitioner made various false charges against state officials including the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.593" offset="3541765">And whatever arguable merit that might have, we think that has been stripped away by this Court's decision in New York Times Company versus Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.071" offset="3587636">So that some of the charges that the -- that were alleged, there was no or even attempt to introduce any evidence whatsoever to approve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.008" offset="3643434">The two basic charges I suppose, which are left and the two basic grounds are that the petitioner violated the injunction, that is that the -- there is no injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.913" offset="3702993">And although I don't even see how that, a proof which we contend has not been proved but even proof of a violation of the original injunction, I don't see how that can be utilized to support the validity of the original injunction in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.095" offset="3779793">The second ground is, of course, as we say are -- are our failure to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.340" offset="3804766">Now, let me take the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.893" offset="3814902">The State, in the course of the testimony, its theory apparently was that the petitioner was operating in Alabama under another name.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.865" offset="3858787">There was another organization with the name association in it and the -- the State took the view that we were operating in Alabama that we were the same as this organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.851" offset="3914794">But I think the Court will agree that in each and every instance and all the witnesses that were brought, that this charge was completely refuted and that there is no evidence brought by the -- by the -- the State on its own of any kind which indicates that this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.834" offset="3990758">All the evidence, as a matter of fact, is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.510" offset="4001416">Every witness testified that, with the injunction issued as of June 1, 1956, that petitioner ceased operation and closed its -- its offices and disbanded its branches and was no longer functioning in the State that the people who are in its paid staff were -- were put on terminal pay, were either transferred or -- or placed in some other functioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.579" offset="4129729">And there is no evidence here to show that we have violated the injunction in any -- any degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.518" offset="4165465">Now, we contend that the registration statute, which we concede that we did not follow, is a venue on service of process statute only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.285" offset="4224502">We think that, as we attempt to point out in our brief, that the purpose of this statute and the purpose under the law of -- of Alabama, is to make foreign corporations amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.435" offset="4293151">So that in any controversy which occurs between the foreign corporation and Alabama citizens, that the Alabama citizens will not be without a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.635" offset="5177866">In other words, there is a remedy available to Alabama if -- if Alabama wants to utilize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.317" offset="5208691">That as a matter of fact, what it has done in this case is to bar the petitioner from coming into the State and I think that under the decisions of this Court, this has really amounted to in effect, a violation of the petitioner's and his members' rights the freedom of association and rights of -- other rights of the First Amendment which have been protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.229" offset="5320286">We think that what Alabama is doing or has attempted to do with this injunction is the very thing that this Court has held that could not be done by Virginia in -- in a construction of a barrier statute that the Court had held could not be done by Florida in the -- in the -- in an investigation of -- by legislative committee that the Court has held could not be done on the grounds of attempting to raise a revenue in Arkansas in Bates versus Little Rock or the application of a statute which had been passed to suppress the illegal organizations in Louisiana versus NAACP.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.933" offset="5495097">We think that what has happened here is that the Court -- that the -- Alabama is -- is attempting to do indirectly what it cannot do directly and that what it also is attempting to do is to bar a review by this Court on the merits, by reaching decisions on procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.191" offset="5584123">In our view of, and I would indicate to the Court in our brief, we think that this state action that the injunction has no validity, that it does -- it is in violation of constitutional rights that the use of this procedure is a violation of due process insofar as petitioner is concerned and that unless this Court in this case is prepared, if the Court agrees that the injunction on this record has no validity, unless this Court is prepared to issue a detailed decree which will afford petitioner relief in the right to operate in the State of Alabama, to resume operation in the State of Alabama without the necessity of the implementation of that decree by the Alabama court, we think that we are not mistaken to suggest that on the basis of the history of this case, that this cause will be here for the fifth time without its final resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.066" offset="5907623">It's for that reason we are urging the Court to review the record, the evidence and make a decision on the merits and to issue a detailed decree which would give support and protection to the right of petitioner to function and operate in the State of Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.115" offset="7767855">Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.790" offset="7790529">It's been a number of different attorneys from Attorney General's Office and the various cases that have come before this Court and other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.481" offset="7829295">But my rule here shows a need to attempt to the State -- to the Court what the State now conceives to be involved in this litigation that's here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.131" offset="7871927">First place, the State of Alabama doesn't consider that the merits of this case are presented to this Court this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.232" offset="7908289">One of the contentions made by petitioner is that its activity in the State of Alabama is not such that brings it within the purview of the qualification statutes for foreign corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.402" offset="7984985">As Mr. Justice Stewart inquired about a while ago, I have here the short notes that I made on the back of the little brief that there had been no State Supreme Court determination that petitioner corporation is subject to the foreign corporation qualifying statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.585" offset="8081742">I was moved to have put that in there because it seldom allot to handle the case of the CIO of American State and Federal Employees Organizing Committee versus Windsor in which the state statutes which required, not required but did not allow state employees to belong to labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.548" offset="8193546">The labor union contended in that case which came to this Court and was decided that it was not a union within the meaning of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.605" offset="8225834">And there, it was held in effect that state court had to make a determination of that matter if didn't come within the statute where no federal constitutional questions were involved or provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.478" offset="8297305">Now, the second reason that I have here is that the case seems to me to present from a State standpoint a question of whether or not, the Supreme Court of Alabama has reasonably and not arbitrarily applied to each Supreme Court Rules of Practice and Procedure to the appellant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.469" offset="8413288">If it has so applied them, and I think this Court has a right to determine whether it has or not, if it has so applied those rules reasonably, then we do not concede that the Court have purport a federal question for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.103" offset="8487790">And the result would be that the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama, which stands as it now, is affirming the lower court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.871" offset="8530840">If the Court in this investigation should find that the Rules and Procedure and Practices of the Supreme Court of Alabama have not been applied reasonably to petitioner in this case, then I assume that the Court -- I say, assume -- I -- I presume, I put it that way, that the Court would reverse and remand the case to the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.272" offset="8648495">And if it thought it was necessary, although I -- I don't know of any instance in which it has been done at that level, might direct that court to proceed with the consideration of all the questions involved on the merits of the case within a reasonable period of time as it did the law of state court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.977" offset="8751313">Now, that I do not know because I am hoping that we will not reach that question and that the Court will find that there has been no unreasonable application of the Rules and Practices of the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.782" offset="8806484">Now, what rule and practice did the Supreme Court of Alabama applied the petition in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.939" offset="8847130">In the first place, it considered petitioner's brief in that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.142" offset="8867924">It didn't strike its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.736" offset="8878268">It didn't dismiss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.052" offset="8883597">It didn't affirm the case because it wasn't a brief that was sufficient to the rule and practices of that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.809" offset="8910660">It considered the brief but it got to the point where that Court, the Supreme Court of Alabama said that you have placed five subdivisions in your brief and on the each, you have made joint assignments of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.443" offset="9009194">And if anyone of those joint assignments of error is bad, is not good on our practice and all other State, now as far as I know, certainly and that's a good -- good time back from our law schools some 40 years ago or maybe 39 to 40, we -- we learned that there and as far as I can tell, it's been the practice ever since I've been practicing law in the ever distinguished member of this Court who probably knows -- still knows more about Alabama practice and I do it could say one way or the other buried himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.021" offset="9167496">But I know that we, in our actual practice, we're careful not to group together a number of assignments of error we had impart a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.966" offset="9215248">We put it all there by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.273" offset="9224443">The Court erred in a certain particular and argued that in detail rather than in group.</text>
