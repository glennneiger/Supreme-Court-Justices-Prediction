            <label>Mr. Ernest R. Mortenson</label>
            <text syncTime="24.057" offset="199555">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.582" offset="225677">The matter before us started out as a tax case and then got involved in bankruptcy but it ends up here as a matter involving interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.075" offset="295685">The issue is whether or not the Government on a tax deficiency can collect interest after a petition in bankruptcy is filed from the debtor's assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.016" offset="371440">This is not a case in which the Government seeks interest on a tax deficiency from the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.474" offset="413236">The Government concedes that it cannot do that because this Court, in City of New York versus Saper, has held that the Government may not collect interest on a tax deficiency accruing after bankruptcy out of the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.794" offset="522533">The case arose in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.639" offset="545938">Bruning, the petitioner, was doing business as Bruning Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.386" offset="572897">During the fourth quarter of 1951, he became in arrears in withholding tax and social security tax in the approximate amount of $4000.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.582" offset="629739">A delinquent tax return was filed and the Government assessed the tax in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.290" offset="668505">It issued a notice and demand in a formal manner in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.170" offset="696090">In June of 1953, Bruning filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.917" offset="743006">Three years later, there were assets in the amount of $700 applied to this tax deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.424" offset="789086">There was no interest applied because the Saper case, decided by this Court, was in effect at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.529" offset="833494">Since, as I shall explain later, taxes have a priority, the $700 applied to the tax deficiency reduced that deficiency but the general creditors received no dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.496" offset="917400">Bruning, on his 1953 and 1954 income tax returns had overpaid his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.624" offset="953866">He had overpaid his tax on both returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.371" offset="972884">And he was entitled to a refund of about $3700.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.049" offset="999528">He filed the claim and the claim was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.029" offset="1023457">The Government then applied this $3700 refund against the withholding taxes and social security taxes that were owed for the fourth quarter of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.445" offset="1097122">There was no notice and demand filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.228" offset="1116244">The Government simply applied the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.176" offset="1132126">When the Government did that, it took $795 and applied it to interest on the $3700 deficiency accruing from the date of the bankruptcy in 1953 until the payment or the credit in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.924" offset="1227107">We do not have in question today interest on prebankruptcy tax deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.464" offset="1265246">Both the taxpayer, petitioner, and the Government concede that the Government is entitled to interest on a tax deficiency up to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.507" offset="1337448">Now, I want to point out at this time the anomalous situation that the taxpayer is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.553" offset="1381543">Suppose the tax deficiency is a $100,000 and that is not too unusual in his bankruptcy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.643" offset="1413935">In the Mighell case, which is in conflict with the Bruning case below, the tax deficiency was $78,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.073" offset="1451656">But if the tax is $100,000, in three years at 6% interest, the interest would be $18,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.502" offset="1497422">Now, the Government, because of its priority, collects the $100,000 but if the payment -- and there's $18,000 available for payment, it cannot be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.478" offset="1565236">That $18,000 is available to general creditors but the Government can't take it up and use it for interest because this Court decided in the Saper case that it could not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.580" offset="1621661">So the taxpayer has no way of wiping out this $18,000 in interest on the tax deficiency and the Government can and will pursue that as long as he lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.027" offset="1679444">They will pursue it and try to take it out of his after bankruptcy acquired assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.565" offset="1713612">Now, the Government is using two inconsistent arguments in trying to get at these after acquired assets of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.166" offset="1780067">Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that taxes are not discharge -- that taxes are not dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.385" offset="1852897">They are provable debts but they are not dischargeable debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.021" offset="1883408">As distinguished from a general creditor who has a provable debt but to the extent that it is not paid out of -- out of the assets of the bankruptcy estate, it is wiped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.459" offset="1941191">The rest of it is discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.678" offset="1950072">Not so with taxes because under the Bankruptcy Code, as I said before, taxes are specifically accepted from discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.097" offset="2007751">Now, we have another part of the Bankruptcy Code which comes into play, as I stated before, the Government took $700 out of the bankrupt's assets to pay the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.947" offset="2079117">That was because the Government, under Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Code, has priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.973" offset="2115271">It gets paid before the general creditors get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.609" offset="2137840">Now, that brings to the inconsistency -- that brings us to the inconsistency I mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.491" offset="2169292">The Government, in trying to save its interest, argues first that it's not approvable debt dischargeable under Section 17 because it says, the interest has not become due at any time during the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.016" offset="2255391">And there's no way of estimating whether it ever will be owing or in what amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.216" offset="2280260">But then, it later argues, quoting from page 19 of the Government brief, "To the extent that interest is provable on a tax liability, it is provable as part of a single provable debt for taxes".</text>
            <text syncTime="564.227" offset="2360299">But provable debts for taxes are specifically accepted from discharge by Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.881" offset="2382869">This is the reason prepetition interest is concededly not discharged in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.617" offset="2405857">The same rationale would -- would control post-petition interest if it too were provable.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.869" offset="2434800">Now, why does the Government argue this?</text>
            <text syncTime="586.849" offset="2450787">First, it says interest is not taxes and then it says interest is taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.822" offset="2474611">Why does it say interest is taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="595.950" offset="2487150">Because if it is taxes, then it is not dischargeable, and there's considerable argument here to the effect that interest is collected like taxes, it's treated like taxes, it's assimilated in the tax but the fact is that interest is not tax, it's never has been and never will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.147" offset="2579937">And as far as being determinable, at any time, you just take your 6% and apply it to the principle and there you have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.833" offset="2618702">But the -- the principle thing here is that under the decision of the Saper case, we believe that this issue was really decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.259" offset="2696443">The broad language of the case, if you'll permit me to read it because I believe it's important, covers this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.406" offset="2736985">The Court stated, and this, Mr. Justice Jackson wrote the opinion, more than 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.670" offset="2762062">Mr. Justice Holmes wrote for the Court that the rules stopping interest at bankruptcy had been -- been followed for more than a century and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.814" offset="2794663">He said the rule was not a matter of legislative command or statutory construction but rather a fundamental principle of the English bankruptcy system that we copied, citing Sexton versus Dreyfus which was -- which was -- the opinion of which was written by Mr. Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.171" offset="2892048">Now, there is no logical reason for cutting off interest as far as the bankruptcy estate is concerned and then taking it up as far as the debtor's assets are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.018" offset="2971460">The Government already has two advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.012" offset="2983372">It has a priority and it has approvable debt that is not dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.983" offset="3007300">Now, the Government seeks a third advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.241" offset="3020361">It wants to pursue the after bankruptcy acquired assets of a debtor and pick up the interest at that point which, if it should have been paid to the Government, ought to come out of the bankruptcy assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.129" offset="3183888">The -- the Government made quite a bit of that by -- by adding cases -- by listing some 90 cases in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.102" offset="3223803">Now, that matter, as far as I know, has never been brought to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.334" offset="3248671">And those cases -- and the Government very clearly says that interest was almost never discussed in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.990" offset="3287333">In other words, those cases were just carried through with the -- with the interest on the -- on the liability carried along.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.063" offset="3439574">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.257" offset="3456397">A bankruptcy case is unfortunately almost invariably somewhat complicated, and I'd like to begin by saying two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.206" offset="3500178">One, as Mr. Justice Goldberg's question suggest, the Government is not claiming anything here for taxes that we don't believe is true of ethics categories of debts that Congress felt were particularly important and therefore, should not be discharged in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.294" offset="3592547">Now, in other words, this case has no special aspect for taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.071" offset="3607698">We treat it as a bankruptcy case primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.015" offset="3619401">I may now and then go out from this, into saying that there's special reasons in the Internal Revenue Code why the Government should win this case but almost entirely, I'll treat it as a bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.060" offset="3671646">The second thing I'd like to say by way of preliminary is I'd like to emphasize a distinction that Mr. Mortenson made at the beginning of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.654" offset="3718040">There are two sorts of claims which can be relevant which a creditor may have in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.283" offset="3740505">He may have a claim against the assets of the bankrupt which have passed into the hands of the trustee, now, sometimes called as the "bankruptcy estate", and he may have a claim against the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.431" offset="3789093">He started with a claim against the debtor and the heart of our position is he continues to have a claim against the debtor unless the Bankruptcy Act discharges it.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.002" offset="3823365">But the distinction between these two types of claim, a claim against the party which is in the hands of the trustee and a claim against the debtor is at the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.569" offset="3865684">The Bankruptcy Act, of course, has two primary functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.554" offset="3881566">One, to muster the assets of the bankrupt, most of the assets, the nonexempt ones, into a pot or fund which should be equitably distributed among the creditors, and two, to discharge the bankrupt from most of his debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.398" offset="3948962">The effect of these two purposes on creditors is carried out largely by Section 63 and Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.374" offset="3992848">Creditors who are -- who have claims against the party, which are almost all creditors under Section 63, generally can recover only against the pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.200" offset="4040182">Section 17 says that the liability of the bankrupt for provable claims, that means the claim that can be realized out of the bankruptcy estate, shall be discharged with certain exceptions, limited exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.911" offset="4102980">A handful of creditors received no claim against the bankruptcy estate against the party.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip B. Heymann</label>
            <text syncTime="1047.449" offset="4293151">Your -- if I may borrow from my boss, Mr. Justice White, I'd like to ask your indulgence to let me go on to -- the -- oh, I say -- I was saying that tort creditors are creditors who don't have any claim against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.447" offset="4373191">They don't have provable claims and so these are generally not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.451" offset="4389177">I assume -- no, I didn't find any cases on it that it's taken for granted that all of their claim remains that they can collect interest as well as principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.525" offset="4425435">But again, I didn't find any cases on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.791" offset="4438497">There's a third category of creditors who get claims both against -- who -- who may have claims against the estate but whose claims are not discharged by Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.447" offset="4489174">Technically, they're provable under Section 63 but not discharged under Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.351" offset="4520730">Congress has made a policy judgment that these claims are too important to be discharged for one reason or the -- for another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.986" offset="4559287">Their -- this -- the six classes of claims are set out at page 14 of our brief in summary and again at page 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.012" offset="4591470">Examples, there seem to be two reasons that -- for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.644" offset="4601919">One is, in some cases, Congress has judged that -- I believe that the creditor needs the money more than the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.225" offset="4632221">A support allowance is not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.939" offset="4643088">A wage earner's claim for recent wages is not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.259" offset="4660433">The wage earner's deposit or an employee's deposit to assure that he'll complete the job isn't discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.423" offset="4689063">Others are not discharged perhaps because of the conduct of the debtor that lead to the claim will fall in malicious injury to another embezzlement, certain types of fiduciary frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.495" offset="4745383">But in any rate, there are six categories of claims of which taxes are one which Congress has said shall not be discharged, although the claimant may have a claim against the pot too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.259" offset="4792404">In other words, as to these six, they can collect from the debtor personally or from the trustee by going into the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.199" offset="4832214">Now, that's the rather technical but important framework of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.415" offset="4857083">The reason it's important are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.245" offset="4872338">One is, that this Court and the English courts, but let me restrict it to this Court, have always exercised a rather considerable common law power in deciding how the pie or how the pot, which is in the hands of the trustee, should be divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.824" offset="4942660">This is a matter that is traditionally been handed in the -- handled in the common law way in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.197" offset="4964185">There -- there are very few provisions dealing with it in the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.558" offset="4981635">On the other hand, discharging a debtor from his liability to a creditor is an act that only the bankruptcy statute has in general have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.476" offset="5025311">This is the first importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.062" offset="5035656">The second importance of the matter is that as a common law rule, this Court has held, following English precedents that go back to 1740, that the -- some -- I'd like to -- I'd like to make the predicate of this sentence somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.830" offset="5102738">This Court has followed English precedents going back to 1740 in setting up a rule for liquidating and distributing the assets in the hands of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.653" offset="5158013">This rule which has been one of administrative conveniences, it's been repeatedly described as that by this Court, is a rule that says, "In valuing the claims against the bankruptcy estate, the claim should be valued as of the date of bankruptcy", that is with interest only up to the -- the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.133" offset="5247875">Now, it's perhaps worthwhile pointing out the administrative inconvenience that would result if anything else were done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.407" offset="5280998">The referee declares periodic dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.713" offset="5302209">If interests were to be valued, if interests at different rates were to be computed all the way up through -- through the period -- to the period of each dividend, different creditors would get different shares of every distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.099" offset="5359783">It would be, in short, a complete mess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.827" offset="5374725">This, plus the equitable argument that creditor should not benefit or be harmed because of their rate of interest during the period, that the assets are in the hands of a court official, has caused the Court to say that as a rule of liquidation where the estate is insolvent, no interest shall be -- interest shall only be computed up to the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.655" offset="5482036">The claim, in other words, should be valued as of the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.122" offset="5511816">My -- in -- in the Saper case, New York versus Saper, this Court held for the first time that this rule for liquidation of the assets in the hands of the trustee applied to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.202" offset="5568136">There is no discussion in the Saper case of anything else except the applicability of the general rule that goes back to the Justice Holmes' opinion in Sexton versus Dreyfus and far beyond that which says that in -- that this is a rule of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.491" offset="5637308">It was just applied to the United States in Saper versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.837" offset="5666670">I want to add only one other thing about to get rid of the Saper case and get rid of the line of cases that deal with interest against the bankruptcy estate and that is that an -- an important exception, which is as old as the rule, proves that the rule denying interest after bankruptcy against the trustee was never intended to protect the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.955" offset="5771160">From the beginning of the rule from 1740, if there any -- if the estate turns out to be solvent, the creditors will enjoy the benefit in the form of payment of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.863" offset="5826853">The debtor will not get it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.335" offset="5836675">There are more over other instances where interest runs after bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.609" offset="5857782">In fact, there's only one case where interest doesn't run after bankruptcy and that's where the estate is insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.991" offset="5891323">These reasons, the reasons that justify the Saper rule and the prior cases obviously have little or no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.537" offset="5929566">I -- I would say no application to a case such as this involving a claim against the debtor personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.302" offset="5964570">There's no administrative inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.829" offset="5974706">There is no harm to other creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.622" offset="5985886">And in general, the -- there's no reason to think that the Saper principle applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.203" offset="6040221">This leaves the case in the posture of going to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.953" offset="6063208">I had begun by saying that of the two types of claims, claims against the estate and claims against the debtor, traditionally, the Court has exercised great common law powers in claims against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.580" offset="6113677">It is -- it has turned to the statute in claims against the debtor in determining discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.177" offset="6148054">And since the -- it was just another -- the Saper rule, which I've just discussed, was a rule that applied only as to claims against the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.028" offset="6191522">For this case, which involves a claim against the debtor, we must turn to Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.870" offset="6218898">Section 17 says that six classes of debts will not be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.504" offset="6253380">The primary position that we have argued in our brief is that Section 17 simply cannot operate to discharge interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.780" offset="6294444">Now, this is a fairly mechanical, technical argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.950" offset="6311163">Before getting to that, I'd like to argue that every reasonable implication when Congress says that a debt shall be preserved against discharge would be that Congress meant that debts, in all its parts, principle and interest, would continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.889" offset="6382947">We cited a case in our brief where the debtor was denied of discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.021" offset="6395486">The bankrupt was denied of discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.074" offset="6403636">The bankruptcy court held and the District Court quickly affirmed that all creditors could receive interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.664" offset="6438013">If the debt is not discharged, interest presumably is not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.640" offset="6461942">Beyond -- beyond this there are, in fact, positive indications that Congress contemplated interest continuing when the debt was not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.515" offset="6513455">In -- I've printed -- I'm afraid at the very late date, a -- a supplemental appendix in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.251" offset="6540413">It refers to a very particular problem that Congress was dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.965" offset="6555251">It's not controlling of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.998" offset="6567372">It's on page 3 of the supplemental appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.468" offset="6581269">Congress provided that there would be interest on any amount not paid in bankruptcy running after the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.077" offset="6615646">It's on page 3, Section 298 of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.089" offset="6639679">The provision disappeared when all the interest provisions of 1939 Code, of which there were many, were merged into the single interest provision which you see at the bottom of the page in 1954 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.042" offset="6719509">It's perhaps for these reasons, for the reasons of the general assumption that when the debt continues, interest continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.352" offset="6748766">Interest after all being -- almost always a con -- commitment of the debt, always -- almost always going along with the debt, that the courts, and we have set forth 90 opinions, I think in the -- in the appendix to our brief, have almost universally allowed interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.966" offset="6823267">Mr. Mortenson is correct in saying, without much discussion, have almost universally allowed interest on an undischarged debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.458" offset="6861197">The courts have said, which is our position here, that if the statute does not discharge the debt, it remains unaffected by the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.645" offset="6901948">This result is moreover confirmed, and here I'm afraid I must again become technical, by the fact that Section 17 will not operate to discharge much of the interest in this case, and we will contend, it doesn't operate to discharge any of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.786" offset="6982510">Mr. Justice White asked about the -- whether interest might not be provable but not allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.693" offset="7010095">It's that -- it's the distinction between provable and allowable that is the technical argument as to interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.057" offset="7039561">Section 17 discharges only provable debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.462" offset="7061191">If interest or any portion of interest is not provable, it's not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.582" offset="7097657">I'd like to direct the attention first to the interest that arises after the bankruptcy proceeding and is completed and all the funds in the hands of the trustees have been paid out of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.524" offset="7157426">It appears clear that this interest simply cannot be provable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.578" offset="7177697">It's not a debt that exist at any time during the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.638" offset="7197968">It's not -- it can't be valued, it can't be estimated in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.880" offset="7214895">Even if it could otherwise be proved, there's a specific provision of the Bankruptcy Act which says that it shall be treated, that such debts which can't be valued during the bankruptcy proceeding should be treated as nonprovable for purpose of -- for purposes of preserving them against discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.438" offset="7289083">Now, as to that interest, I don't think there's any question but within traditional categories it's not provable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.644" offset="7321997">A harder question in the technical -- in the technical area of whether it's a provable debt or not is presented by the interest that arises during the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.972" offset="7367241">Now, the Saper case carefully says throughout that interest should not be allowed on a tax claim after the date of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.050" offset="7423561">The Saper case never says specifically it's not a provable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.636" offset="7449893">Now, we believe that the -- the reasons Saper gave established that it's not a provable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.170" offset="7484061">Saper said two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.068" offset="7491688">One, it turned back to the historic rule which says that provable claims must be determined as of the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.365" offset="7524812">And it -- and this was the Sexton rule and it turned to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.063" offset="7539649">Its -- second of all, looked at the statute which defines provable claims, and it -- this Section 63, there are six or eight categories of provable claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.829" offset="7578728">Two of these specifically are listed as not including interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.947" offset="7595133">Saper looked to that and said therefore, interest should not be careful, regarding the word "allowable" on a tax claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.017" offset="7631391">We believe that meant provable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.296" offset="7652603">Now, I -- I don't mean to suggest that there's no question as to whether interest arising during the proceeding could be considered a provable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.031" offset="7691473">I suppose there -- I suppose, perhaps, it could be considered a provable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.994" offset="7707355">I don't believe that interest arising after the proceeding could be considered a provable claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.905" offset="8123016">(Inaudible) -- there are -- there are two -- there are two courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.441" offset="8133151">The Second Circuit and Ninth Circuit have ruled squarely on it and have held squarely in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.633" offset="8153945">We believe that we could forget about the bankruptcy proceeding, that all of the assets go to the other creditors, move against the debtor and collect the full amount of our debt including interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.413" offset="8201070">Now, the -- this isn't essential to this case that we maintain this position but this is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.138" offset="8239940">I -- there's only one more point I have on the technical argument then I'll be happy to leave that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.060" offset="8267630">Mr. Mortenson referred to what he called an inconsistency in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.444" offset="8289155">We do argue that to the extent that taxes -- to the extent that interest is provable, it's provable as a part of the claim that it's not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.063" offset="8339623">In other words, if we're wrong in saying that Saper says -- if we're wrong in our construction of Saper, we believe that Saper says that interest is not provable and therefore not dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.958" offset="8387166">But if we're wrong about that, and some interest is provable, interest arising during the pendency of the proceeding, not afterwards but during the pendency of it, then this would be provable as part of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.516" offset="8437426">The -- I was going to say the leading earlier cases, Johnson against Norris which says just this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.629" offset="8461876">This is what Judge Frank said in a dissent in Sword Line, "No separate proof would be required, would be all part of the same claim."</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.585" offset="8493746">And for that reason, it wouldn't be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.636" offset="8505866">This would be true of all six categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.327" offset="8516629">It would be particularly true of tax claims where the Internal Revenue Code says that interest is always part of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.813" offset="8546617">That's one of the few places or the part from my principle of discussing on the bankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.838" offset="8574725">I'd like to move on from -- what I've tried to say so far is that the Saper case has nothing to do with claims against debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.575" offset="8617671">It only has to do with claims against the estate, it's a liquidation rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.716" offset="8634284">As Collier says very clearly before distributing the assets in the hands of the trustee, I've tried to say it on its face, Section 17 would seem to leave the whole debt intact, principal as well as interest and that construed technically half of the interest to the most important part of the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.975" offset="8711293">The interest that arises after the end of the bankruptcy proceeding can't be discharged by Section 17 and Congress recognizes this in the statute in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.462" offset="8761240">I think in fairness and perhaps to guard myself, I'd like to say a word about the equities of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.436" offset="8797080">On the surface, it appears that it's highly inequitable to allow interest to be collected after bankruptcy against the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.946" offset="8843160">Now, to that, we have three responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.843" offset="8866774">One is, the Government is one of six classes of claimants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.315" offset="8892583">I don't believe there's anyway that the Government can be separated off from its five neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.701" offset="8914213">Many of those classes or several of those classes were apparently chosen because Congress believed that the creditor deserved the interest more than the bankrupt debtor, needed the interest more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.459" offset="8969174">A leading example would be a case of a wife with a child who is owed a support payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.470" offset="8997282">Now, the -- her husband goes through bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.413" offset="9008985">Congress determined that she needed the support payment more than the bankrupt needed the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.479" offset="9033331">If, because, she didn't have the support payment, she had to borrow money and pay interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.427" offset="9057050">Congress would also want the husband to be liable for interest on the amount on the -- on the length of time he didn't pay it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.591" offset="9089755">This shouldn't be her cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.821" offset="9094666">It should be the husband's cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.064" offset="9103653">When Congress decided that she needed it more, Congress presumably decided that she needed the interest more, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.813" offset="9134582">She's doing without money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.833" offset="9146702">In the tax area, which I don't think can be separated off, even there, the equities are not 100% clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.754" offset="9182438">In this case, Mr. Bruning collected interest from us for the very period that he's objecting to pay an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.445" offset="9217128">Now, I just mean to give this as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.362" offset="9224861">I don't think this is controlling in this case, an example of the fact that the equities are never clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.369" offset="9252864">As I calculate it, this is -- the interest is referred to in the record, as I calculate it, the interest is very close to the same amount going both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.051" offset="9291525">Now, this -- if there's any equity here, it's not, in this particular case if there's any equity, it's not in Mr. Bruning's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.540" offset="9325484">Finally on the equities, I want to say that it's very questionable policy to deny a creditor the price he gets for forbearance in collecting his debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.381" offset="9380864">Now, anyone of the six classes of creditors in this case, can collect against the exempt assets of the debtor and can collect against anything the debtor gets immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.517" offset="9429452">The Government, in particular, has very broad collection powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.199" offset="9444185">I think the Government has heart and would not collect against the home or any other exempt assets of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.763" offset="9474382">But the Government could and forbears, perhaps in part, because it receives interest for its forbearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.502" offset="9501341">It's paid for its forbearance and that's what -- that's what interest is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.477" offset="9517328">It's very questionable policy to force creditors to collect immediately or as soon as possible or to encourage them to rather than to forbear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.546" offset="9573543">In the very few minutes I have remaining, I'd like only to say -- perhaps a good way of saying it is explaining -- is to explain why I set forth the first part of the supplemental appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.196" offset="9620146">Mr. Mortenson hasn't referred here to a provision of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code which says that the United States can collect interest on any -- on a portion of a tax which is allowed but not paid but he relied on it in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.560" offset="9693602">I set forth the supplemental appendix because it -- this Act came in in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.923" offset="9719097">The function of the Act was to permit the bankruptcy court to serve in place of what is now the tax court, the board -- Board of Tax Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.051" offset="9759535">The Government was permitted, instead of waiting the length of time it would have to in an income tax case, to go directly -- assist the tax directly in going to the bankruptcy court and litigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.841" offset="9806764">The bankruptcy court would decide whether it was valid or invalid, that is whether it was allowed, to be allowed or not to be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.594" offset="9841768">The Government was given in exchange by provision (b) which is now the provision that Mr. Mortenson -- the predecessor of provision Mr. Mortenson relies on, the statute of limitations of six years after the bankruptcy proceeding was over, after it was determined whether the Government was entitled to its tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.384" offset="9920867">The Government was also given an interest on any amount that was then determined to be due and not paid at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.974" offset="9959320">Nothing could be clearer than this interest provision in rebutting any contention that the statute was intended to cut off interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.328" offset="9996727">Finally, in the Committee Reports on that very tax bill on which it came in, the House Committee made entirely clear that it believed interest was owing not only for the period after the end of the bankruptcy proceeding but also for the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.266" offset="10072482">I've set that forth in the little Appendix 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.315" offset="10084603">It says that there has to be a special rate of 6% instead of 12% during the pendency of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.019" offset="10115427">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ernest R. Mortenson</label>
            <text syncTime="2509.455" offset="10141236">I would take just a -- just a few minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.089" offset="10159731">As far as the solvent estate is concerned, I don't think -- I don't think how it handled proves anything because if there's enough money to go around, the whole thing is treated as if there weren't any bankruptcy in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.993" offset="10223365">But the argument about different rates of interest and inequity among creditors doesn't seem to have any application at all to a government claim for taxes because the Government has a fourth priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.883" offset="10282924">The Government comes in before any general creditor does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.402" offset="10297031">It has 6% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.039" offset="10303509">If it's taken out, we don't have any interest problem as far as the general creditors are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.866" offset="10326810">But I just want to call the attention to one more thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.109" offset="10347813">The sections of the Code, set out in the appendix by the Government, do not apply because they deal with a situation where there has been a notice and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.252" offset="10392430">In this case, there was no notice and demand, and that's a technical term and it's a prerequisite to a collection of taxes except where you get a credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.277" offset="10440495">We -- in this case, there was a credit from 1953 and 1954 taxes on a 1951 taxes that it don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.555" offset="10469543">But here's something that I consider very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.577" offset="10489710">The first section set out from the 1926 Code is Section 282 (a) and calls for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.918" offset="10527013">That is carried over into the next section given in the Government appendix to Section 298.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.609" offset="10557837">And you will note, it calls for interest at the rate of 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.137" offset="10579884">Now, between 1939 and the 1954 Code, this Court decided Saper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.154" offset="10611963">And after Saper was decided, in the 1954 Code, as you will find in the petitioner's brief, Section 6 at page 29, petitioner's brief, Section 6873, unpaid claims, it does not call for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.571" offset="10705690">Under the 1939 Code, Section 298, if you read it you'll see it calls for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.900" offset="10727006">After the Saper case, Section 6873 (a) does not call for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.606" offset="10753755">The inference is that Congress codified the Saper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.626" offset="10777893">Thank you very much.</text>
