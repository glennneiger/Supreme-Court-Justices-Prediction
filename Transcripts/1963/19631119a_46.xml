            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 46 Charles A., Meeker et al., Petitioners, versus Ambassador Oil Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.252" offset="220348">Mr. Adams.</text>

            <label>Mr. O. R. Adams, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="31.009" offset="227453">Mr. Chief Justice, members of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.326" offset="252635">The petitioners in this case Charles A. and Sybil Meeker were plaintiffs in the trial court and the respondent, Ambassador Oil Corporation was a defendant there.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.947" offset="315120">This was a diversity of citizenship case about in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.668" offset="354095">The -- there are two questions here before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.945" offset="379173">One is whether or not the petitioner was wrongfully denied a trial by jury in the District Court and two, whether or not the petitioners were stopped to contest the claim of Ambassador Oil Corporation to the leasehold interest involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.397" offset="492962">Now, Mr. Meeker and his associates have a 30-day oil and gas lease on this property involved, what was -- which was to expire in its primary term.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.113" offset="559835">On June third 1958 by two conveyances, the petitioner's claim of 33/128th working that was done in this lease at 1/16th overriding royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.575" offset="629635">Now, shortly prior to June the 3rd, 1958, the Meeker Group commits drilling operations under this lease which continued the primary term of this lease unless they failed to carry through these drilling operations with due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.364" offset="732871">Shortly after the work was commenced on this lease, a dispute arose with Sunray Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.456" offset="769233">Sunray had adjoining acreage to this lease and Sunray wanted a larger spacing than had been started by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.107" offset="823777">And when this dispute arose, the petitioners discontinued their drilling operations except for some more preliminary work in August of 1958 until September the 2nd, 1958, at which time the Oklahoma Corporation Commission made a spacing order on this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.793" offset="922520">And as soon as this spacing order was made, they again fired up and they spotted the oil and eventually bought in a producer on this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.647" offset="969958">And the meantime, you see the lease would have expired on June the 3rd, but they did commence their drilling so that extent to the primary term.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.708" offset="1014157">In the meantime, on July the 22nd, Ambassador Oil Corporation, they responded in this case, obtained another lease on this same property.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.529" offset="1065462">On July the 22nd, Ambassador obtained another lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.319" offset="1084688">And when they got this lease, when they went over and talked to Mrs. Lowder out of another lease on the same property, they knew a number of things, they knew that the petitioners' lease was a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.743" offset="1154382">They knew that drilling operations have been commenced on this drill site.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.771" offset="1182490">They were told by Mrs. Lowder, “My lease is tied up.” They knew also that the Meeker Group on the adjoining acreage had brought in the exploratory well in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.807" offset="1274650">As a producer, which made all of this property light, well after the Meeker Group again started up, when the spacing order was made by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and after they had this well drilled, one-third down, then Ambassador Oil Corporation called up and thanked this group for drilling on their lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.260" offset="1360436">They have been taken the trouble to get releases.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.759" offset="1374438">They knew all these things existed but they didn't get releases and after all this commenced, after they saw, they must speak up.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.346" offset="1424802">They thanked the people for drilling on their lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.397" offset="1448939">Now, after the Meeker -- the driller on this well first turn about the respondent's claim, he started trying to get hold of Mr. Meeker.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.862" offset="1494810">The driller started trying to get hold of Mr. Meeker.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.666" offset="1505991">He couldn't find Mr. Meeker.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.723" offset="1514245">He then got a Mr. Herman Hurst to look into the matter and Mr. Hurst and the driller and of course it didn't make much difference to the driller because all he had was a working interest, but they decided, “Well, we had better make a compromise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="369.117" offset="1579865">They did make a compromise, but Mr. Meeker didn't make any compromise and he never agreed to any compromise and why because although this purported compromise would allow the working interest holders including the driller to the end up with substantially the same interest, it would not allow the petitioners to end up with that same interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.959" offset="1679235">Because under the lease which we claim here today is the valid lease on this property, the petitioner have substantially the same working interest, except, except that this working interest would not have been burdened with the $2500 oil from the Ambassador Oil Corporation and except that the petitioners would have a 1/16th override and that's what we're here about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.742" offset="1806294">The 1/16th override and doing away with that oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.526" offset="1821445">Now if the Ambassador lease or considered to follow that lease, the Ambassador Oil Corporation would have a 3/32nd override burdening this lease and the working interest worst that it was before, they would have a $2500 oil payment and Meeker's would not have the override.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.566" offset="1937638">Why are these issues, of course, did we have anything here except the question whether it should have been a jury file of the question of legal title?</text>

            <text syncTime="504.034" offset="2119555">Well, Your Honor, the argument will be made that if the right on the second issue, it wouldn't make any difference whether we were wrongfully denied at jury trial or not because we had nothing to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.370" offset="2204818">Also, if we were allowed a jury trial and it were decided that they were right in their second contention here, we might as well -- insofar as the petitioners are concerned, we might as well not be here anyway because we could not possibly went it in the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.837" offset="2378689">The Tenth Circuit felt that the petitioners had ratified the Ambassador lease although it's hard to determine just why they thought so, whether it was based on the deed for taking -- or taking -- working interest payments under the second deed and that gets me to the point of the estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.032" offset="2491538">You see, Meeker's claimed under Mrs. Lowder, the widow lady who had owned a -- owned the surface here.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.302" offset="3316590">Yes Your Honor, they would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.466" offset="3325262">And the Tenth Circuit recognized this and the Tenth Circuit said, “We recognize that you would have been entitled to a jury trial on your second cause of action which was a slander of title action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="819.658" offset="3382000">But they said, “The court in determining title in your first cause of action makes the question loop.”</text>
            <text syncTime="827.985" offset="3415333">Now, that's in effect what they say and in that part of this action, that is what we're complaining about today that that statement of the court is directly contrary to the Beacon Theatres case, which states that you cannot -- that trial court cannot choose to determine the equitable issues first and thereby, make the legal issues res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.610" offset="3545840">Now, on that point, in our first cause of action, we -- we say that on our -- that in our first cause of action itself in however, we were entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.311" offset="3592652">The reason we say that we were entitled to a jury trial in the first cause of action, is first, if it were for determination of title alone, if it were for determination of title alone, this Court has noted that the declare -- that the Declaratory Judgment Act has expanded legal remedies to the extent that it may not be necessary, that we'll need to see whether it is necessary to have an equitable action now.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.828" offset="3722637">And we say Your Honor that it isn't today unnecessary to have this equitable action.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.035" offset="3751476">Now, I think that our complaint in this case shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.413" offset="3765060">We didn't say in the old plank titled manner, that someone is bothering us in our peace and enjoyment of our property and you won't -- and we want you to enjoin them, we want an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.624" offset="3837889">We said that we have legal title to our property and we want the Court to determine that we have legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.433" offset="3873102">And that the Court can and should have done that under the Declaratory Judgment Act and thereby, allowing us trial to the -- by jury on that point, if had been there all by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.252" offset="3932348">In addition, we ask for an accounting on these oral royalties in our first cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.321" offset="3956694">And we submit that the Dairy Queen case says, “That unless, this accounting is so complicated, that it could not possibly be unraveled by the jury that therein our first cause of action when we are entitled to the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="980.442" offset="4025135">Then when we get to this second cause of action, a pure and plain toward action by which besides our special damages for keeping us from getting our royalties, we intended to get punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.468" offset="4089292">A court action based on one interference with contact rights to slander of title or interference with contract rights was based on Ambassador Oil Corporation coming in and talking on Mrs. Lowder into giving them another lease when she told them, “Our land is tied up.”</text>
