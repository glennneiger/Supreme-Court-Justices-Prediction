            <label>Mr. Stanley E. Loeb</label>
            <text syncTime="15.425" offset="165073">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.222" offset="168312">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.952" offset="199137">Mr. Brumfield has stated the facts of the case and I would like to pick up in the discussion of the Dick versus New York Life Insurance Company decision, which as Mr. Justice Goldberg pointed out, has left open the question of whether the sufficiency of evidence is -- could be measured by state law or by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.219" offset="320240">That might be an open question but in the same decision, there is found the falsity of statement that under the area rule, presumptions and burden of proof in the diversity case are substantive in the matters of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.476" offset="401324">And the law of Louisiana, the substantive law of Louisiana presumes that a motorist or everybody else obeys the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.318" offset="456600">There is no presumption of negligence, presumption as it -- just to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.705" offset="482200">And the decisions of our Supreme Court are clear that in a case of this kind predicated on Article 2315 of our Civil Code which is cited on the first page of respondent's brief in a footnote puts upon the plaintiff the burden of proof of all the elements necessary to establish liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.230" offset="600273">In a case like this where there was no witness to the accident, the first element of proof is that this -- the defendant was a party to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.735" offset="646353">And the second element, which had -- the defendant was negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.039" offset="667564">Now, this case, after the jury found for the plaintiff was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and Chief Judge -- then Chief Judge Hutcheson wrote the opinion for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.963" offset="747186">And he carefully avoided reference to any State decision in arriving at the conclusion that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdict, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.738" offset="798281">And second, that the record was literally thought with reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.236" offset="832345">Apparently, the reversible error question is not before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.254" offset="848436">It was not raised in petitioner's brief and I comment it in respondent's brief, that such was the case on page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.755" offset="910399">I -- the comment is made that petitioner has not discussed in her brief the holding of the Court of Appeals on the first appeal that there was reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.657" offset="953971">But --</text>

          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="214.398" stopTime="216.825">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="214.398" offset="960972">But that would be before us anyhow, would it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_e_loeb" startTime="216.825" stopTime="747.796">
            <label>Mr. Stanley E. Loeb</label>
            <text syncTime="216.825" offset="970689">I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.248" offset="976332">I believe it's before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.456" offset="981243">Perhaps I used the wrong word Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.829" offset="990647">It's before you, the whole case is before you but I meant that the issue hasn't been raised in petitioner's -- either petition or in their brief in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.174" offset="1048116">The problem now seems to be directed toward the mandate of the Court of Appeals in the first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.102" offset="1083747">And it is as Mr. Brumfield has pointed out a most unusual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.518" offset="1105481">And it seems to me that this Court's attention was attracted by the mandate in its respect to the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.245" offset="1144351">With the permission of the Court, I will read the mandate."</text>
            <text syncTime="265.284" offset="1164518">Because however, evidence as distinguished from rumor and speculation as to the why and how of the death of plaintiff-decedent and as to the responsibility of the defendant for it, may have been or maybe discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.798" offset="1234526">We order the judgment reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter a judgment for defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.646" offset="1262007">Unless plaintiff, within a time and under considerations to be fixed by the district judge, makes a satisfactory showing that on another trial, evidence of sufficient probative force to justify submission of the case to the jury will be open.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.711" offset="1330239">In which case, the judgment shall be for a new trial."</text>
            <text syncTime="311.552" offset="1349569">So what the Court of Appeals did was to remand the case to the District Court to allow the plaintiff to make out to the satisfaction of the district judge, with Judge Wright, that on another trial she could produce evidence of sufficient probative force -- force to take the case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.397" offset="1448939">Now, what happened was, plaintiff timely filed an appropriate motion for a new trial and in support of that motion and on the order of the District Court, some nine or 10 depositions were taken including the depositions of some of the witnesses who had testified on the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.549" offset="1541517">In addition to that, there was an ex parte report from an accident technician or purported accident technician which was all submitted to Judge Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.226" offset="1584253">Judge Wright considered the motion and the evidence submitted in support of the motion in light of the mandate and ruled that there was nothing in the evidence submitted in support of the mandate to -- to support the conclusion that on another trial there would be probative evidence that could go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.546" offset="1693550">Therefore, he refused the new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.451" offset="1705148">Plaintiff asked for a rehearing and the rehearing was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.795" offset="1722598">The argument was heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.918" offset="1731062">And if the Court please, that was when I came into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.059" offset="1747571">My predecessor, who is Mr. Robert G. Hughes, was elected to the bench after the case was tried and after the case was argued and after the Fifth Circuit had ruled on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.901" offset="1795009">And I came into the case when he was elevated to the state bench and picked it up at the second -- at the first rehearing, the second argument on the motion for a new trial before Judge Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.496" offset="1853315">Judge Wright again considered and refused a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.512" offset="1873377">Thereupon, plaintiff appealed again to the Court of Appeals seeking review and getting review of Judge Wright's rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.591" offset="1913710">That case was argued to a panel of the Court and a few weeks thereafter, counsel were notified that the panel would submit it to the whole court en banc and additional briefs could be submitted, that was done and the whole Court considered the matter and rendered the opinion in the second appeal affirming Judge Wright's refusal of a new trial by a divided court, five-to-four with Chief Judge Reeves filing a dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.362" offset="2040769">In his dissent, it's leveled with the Seventh Amendment and that raises in my mind the notion that that is the crux of this case whether the mandate, the original mandate, has done violence to the Seventh Amendment, because I know this Court is busy and has not concerned itself with the particular facts of a particular diversity suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.450" offset="2141184">But the -- the Seventh Amendment feature of the case is the important one as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.769" offset="2174412">Now, in the Slocum case, this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Van Devanter said in 19 -- I think 1930 that, "Everything of a phiso -- philosophical nature concerning the Seventh Amendment which could be said at that time had been said.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.154" offset="2259989">And there was little to be added to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.181" offset="2272110">That the Seventh Amendment restricted the scope of appellate review to the -- that is in -- in federal court, to the common law as it existed in 1791, which interpreted means that where the suf -- insufficiency of the evidence is grounds for a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.676" offset="2386108">The Court could grant a new trial and nothing more."</text>
            <text syncTime="575.236" offset="2404289">That was the rule of common law in effect in 1791.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.654" offset="2429994">Now, it is quite apparent that the mandate which I just read does not order a new trial, nor does it deprive the plaintiff of their rights guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment because in the case of Gasoline -- and it's cited in my brief, Products Company versus Champlin which is 380 -- 283 U.S. 494.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.001" offset="2583385">This Court held that the Seventh Amendment guarantee did not restrict the appellate courts to the procedure of the common law of 1791.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.181" offset="2632077">And the opinion says, "We're not concerned with form, we're concerned with the substance of the Amendment."</text>
            <text syncTime="639.523" offset="2661439">And the modern practice even then, was not to be circumscribed because of just blind adherence to the old forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.216" offset="2720266">Now, in 1960, when this case was remanded, it was remanded with -- and thought in mind that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provided the mechanics, the tools whereby the District Court could ascertain in advance of another trial whether the judge would be constrained to direct the verdict at the close of the plaintiff's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.170" offset="2832071">And that's exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.077" offset="2839698">The plaintiff had unrestricted opportunity and did produce all of the witnesses he could possibly find.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.996" offset="2875329">Those witnesses, as counsel told you in his argument, testified -- well Officer Prudom (ph) said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.389" offset="2904900">And Officer Prudom (ph) testified that Officer Gidrey (ph) said it and it was a hodge-podge of conflicting rumor, speculation and guess work.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.544" offset="2953592">The whole record is here, the original depositions of those witnesses are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.636" offset="2981909">And on the second appeal, the -- which even the dissenting opinion of Judge Reeves pointed out that it was just a conglomerate mass of hearsay which would be inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.982" offset="3043349">However, Judge Reeves thought that there was one piece of evidence there that was sufficient to take the case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.350" offset="3076786">And that was apparently the reason for his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.001" offset="3091414">But --</text>
