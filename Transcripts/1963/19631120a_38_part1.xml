            <text syncTime="47.819" offset="294640">This is an action and a direct appeal from a decision of a three-judge District Court which was convened in the Northern District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.719" offset="342288">An action was brought by Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Company challenging the constitutionality of a portion of the Florida Milk Commission Act being Chapter 501 Florida Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.460" offset="409161">The complaint, an amended complaint asked for injunctive relief and also asked for declaratory relief with respect to the application of certain orders insofar as they affected the Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Company which is a milk distributor located in Pensacola, Florida which is 16 miles from the Alabama state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.718" offset="530265">The lower court considered three questions and one was whether or not the application of a portion of this Act and the orders which implemented it by the Florida Milk Commission burdened unduly interstate commerce, also whether or not minimum producer prices with respect to sale made to military installation could be enforced by the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.208" offset="652204">And the third question which the District Court considered was whether or not the distributor's tax on milk distributed which was 15 cents per 100 gallons, milk distributed by a Florida producer, Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Company to military installations exclusive jurisdiction to which have been seeded to the United States was in fact applicable and collectible by the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.515" offset="765471">Those were the three questions which the District Court determined adversely to the Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Company, and from this adverse decision, a direct appeal is taken to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.301" offset="852616">In November 1961, the Pensacola area which consisted of the Western most four counties located within the State of Florida came within the jurisdiction of the Florida Milk Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.018" offset="947493">Immediately after they came within the jurisdiction of the Florida Milk Commission, the Florida Milk Commission began a scheme which we contend burden unduly interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.562" offset="1113631">The first thing that the Florida Milk Commission did with respect to these four counties was to set a minimum producer price of 61 cents per gallon which was the highest price in the United States, the highest published price in the United States as that -- as of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.869" offset="1194820">The second thing that the Milk Commission did to implement this particular scheme was to enter an allocation order in which it allocated all of the Class I sales to Florida Milk Commissions to Florida Milk producers and set up in a ratio which total 100% of all sales, the amount of sales which were to be allocated to each particular producer of Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.480" offset="1341315">The third ground which implemented this particular scheme was the law which said that Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Company or a milk distributor could not terminate its relationship with a producer except for just cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.846" offset="2698742">But this means of course that that an Alabama producer, even though he -- the closer in fact geographically will never have an opportunity of selling at a Class 1 price to Polar until all of Polar's Florida producers have been given the opportunity of getting the Class I sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.215" offset="2804276">So that the out-of-state producers are insulated and isolated from selling to Polar by a tariff barrier and by a tariff wall which economically is just as real as can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.370" offset="2872822">In that result, economically of course will be this. It will be that Polar will have to then either go out and pay and buy its Class II sales or Class III or IV needs from outside sources at a lower price because this Court of course is familiar with the classification of milk and that Class I received the highest price and the price paid decreases in the decreasing scale of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.458" offset="3005210">So that it means that the Alabama producer or the Mississippi producer even though he'll be a regular producer could never have an opportunity literally to eat at the first table until after all of the needs of Class I sales of Polar are satisfied insofar as Florida producers are able to satisfy those needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.538" offset="8821530">On behalf of the Milk Commission, I will address myself primarily to the two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.222" offset="8848280">One the involvement of the military milk, the other with the regulatory fee imposed by State and reserve to Mr. Savary, may it please the Court, the question of the involvement of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.989" offset="8907316">I think first of all the brief explanation of the Florida's approach to the military milk question and particularly with the reference to this area might be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.948" offset="8959143">First of all, as this case begin its development even prior to the complaint and in responding to your question, the record does reflect the vociferous opposition of this plaintiff to the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.077" offset="9035630">The record reflects that as a result of -- and by the way Your Honor that he does not load himself because he's a distributor, producers and producer-distributors do load.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.532" offset="9081501">After series of letters to his producers against after they succeeded in loading in this jurisdiction, this record reflects a series of unilateral price slash-in to the producers directed to this plant unparallel in our history of milk in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.599" offset="9157778">So the answer is very definitely, he was opposed and from that time on this case begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.508" offset="9185364">Now, what its involvement in military milk?</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.055" offset="9195604">I think one significant thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.412" offset="9201037">The complaint which brought forth to jurisdiction of this three-judge tribunal, one alleged primarily that the military milk order, effective in the Pensacola market precluded his utilization of other state milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.933" offset="9291107">And jurisdiction in that point brought forth, the three-judge tribunal going up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.574" offset="9325693">Now, before we can even get the pre-trial conference, the producers brought it out as they can in our statutory structure, the military milk order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.633" offset="9385880">So that at the time of the pre-trial conference, may it please the Court, there was no statutory or regulation or attempted enforcement in the field of military milk at all, none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.027" offset="9443453">So that Judge Caldwell in his pre-trial order says that we are in effect true with the military milk question, it has become moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.037" offset="9483473">And there was an order into that effect in the reference and it is noted in my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.227" offset="9592247">Class I is generally that which is utilized in a drinking form by customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.280" offset="9612518">Now, military milk itself would fit that classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.438" offset="9629132">But because of the necessity of bidding, if they want use it, there is a classification, a separate classification called military milk and a separate price.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.198" offset="9696214">Now, the military classification was removed in Florida prior to this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.813" offset="9722650">So what he's doing here is saying at the time of this trial, they get it back in the backdoor and saying, “But what if we wanted to use Florida milk in this area since there is no classification of it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.998" offset="9775313">And the -- he's involved here is because of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.910" offset="9795062">He can do two things if he wants to use Florida milk but be mindful that it came into court because it was keeping him from using other state milk that he can acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.932" offset="9827140">And this gentleman testified in court that if he never saw of another Florida producer, the milk man would not miss one delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.547" offset="9861517">That's how significant this matter is to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.722" offset="11890291">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.628" offset="11901889">I will address my remarks mainly to the commerce question that has been brought up by the appellant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.840" offset="11934699">But before doing so, I believe that it will be of assistant to this Court and analyzing the facts in this case, and this case to understand a little bit more about the milk biddings in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.747" offset="11994363">Now very briefly, there are five milk marketing areas in the State of Florida under the jurisdiction of the Florida Milk Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.493" offset="12025396">We are concerned in this case only with the Pensacola area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.112" offset="12039816">But very briefly, we have the Tallahassee area, the Northeast area which is Jacksonville, the Central Florida and the Tampa area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.253" offset="12072417">Now, this so-called scheme that the appellant accuses the Commission of adopting is the same scheme used in every other area in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.782" offset="12122467">In other words, we have a uniform system of milk regulation in each of the five milk marketing areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.307" offset="12148590">Now, I should point out to the Court to this 61 cent price has -- since the trial on this case been dropped to 59 cents in the Pensacola area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.507" offset="12189445">It is also 59 cents in the Tallahassee area but it is 61 cents in the other three areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.945" offset="12215150">So in effect the Tallahassee and Pensacola area has a lower Class I price in the other areas in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.464" offset="12241272">Now, the base order or base scheme as referred to by appellant is as I said a uniform order but designating each milk marketing area but the same intent, the same construction, the same meaning as in this order, as an area order in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.732" offset="12310340">Now, the Pensacola area was under the control of the Florida Milk Commission until in April of 1958 which timely produces loaded the Commission now or a period of approximately four years, the Commission was out of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.499" offset="12389334">The producers ordered them back in once again in November 21, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.999" offset="12415352">Following this point, the Polar Ice Cream Company, the appellant in this case arbitrarily cut prices to his producers.</text>
