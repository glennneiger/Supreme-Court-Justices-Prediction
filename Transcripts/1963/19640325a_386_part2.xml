            <text syncTime="13.593" offset="157759">Well, in those two minutes, I think that it is an opportunity after having had a few moments to let the thoughts spill on over us as they have been coming at us for two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.246" offset="192345">To recollect that the key issue in this case is the power of an agency directed by a statute not to promulgate any rules going to either rights or contracts which will be effective in the future without holding a hearing and developing an evidentiary record.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.132" offset="247933">The issue then is the power of that agency despite that statute to hold such a hearing that does not provide for a record or the development of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.104" offset="287744">This was an issue that has come up once before.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.365" offset="296835">It did not get as far as this Court but it was actively litigated in the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.718" offset="318255">Before 1960, the Federal Power Commission issued its general policy statement in which it promulgated prices for some 23 areas in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.018" offset="355453">And in that general policy statement, it provided for specific prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.129" offset="371858">And the consumers of natural gas felt that they did not like those prices and they challenged the issuance of that policy statement in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.720" offset="406235">And there the court said, “But this is only a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.054" offset="419610">There has been no hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.152" offset="423999">The Commission cannot promulgate prices without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.119" offset="435806">The avenues of recourse and the development of facts must be kept open as they are here under this policy statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="89.886" offset="462869">“But the statement, “said the court, “may stand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="92.736" offset="474363">So, these rules may stand as policy only.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.658" offset="4586036">But here, the provision of the rules permitting petitions for waiver to be filed enables a company in the case of a Memphis-type provision or in the case of such a provision as Mr. Gilliam referred to for an adjustment on account of rising costs due to the necessity for eliminating contamination which may occur if they have circumstances like that that the Commission has not considered, that are not within the ambit of the -- of the general problem, which it has resolved or -- or which it was dealing with, then it can apply for a -- a waiver and the Commission will grant it an app -- a hearing as it has in the of the case of the -- the Memphis-type clause itself, which Atlantic presented in a petition for amendment -- for waiver of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.805" offset="4802644">And the fact that there has been delay in that Atlantic proceeding to which Mr. Gilliam referred as though this were a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.924" offset="4835035">This was a run around, the Commission was giving the companies is I submit, perfectly explained by the fact that when the examiner took that case under consideration, he was immediately confronted by the fact that the rule which was sought to be waived was one which the Tenth Circuit has said was an invalid rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.172" offset="4900028">And the court examiner, I would suppose is waiting up to see what the outcome of this decision is.</text>
