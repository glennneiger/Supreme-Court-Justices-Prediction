            <text syncTime="29.261" offset="220453">If the Court please, this is a Section 301 action to compel Wiley to submit to arbitration under the Union's contract with Interscience Publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.239" offset="272280">Interscience and Wiley were technical and scientific publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.286" offset="292551">Interscience, for bona fide reasons, had some -- had merged into Wiley four months before the expiration of Interscience's contract with the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.928" offset="347094">As a result of the merger, the business of Interscience was combined with Wiley, and the Interscience stockholders, under the merger and consolidation agreement, received a 20% stock interest in the Wiley Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.375" offset="412923">Interscience was a small company, and its clerical workers were unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.735" offset="434343">Wiley was a large much over company, had never been and was not and is not unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.784" offset="466526">The Interscience contract, which is sued under, contained no successor cause, and the contract, specifically, was not assumed by Wiley at the time in the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.995" offset="519398">The merger took place on October 2nd, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.752" offset="538415">The Interscience contract by its terms expired on January 31, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.004" offset="575404">The process of combining the two businesses was commenced immediately, and all of this is contested, apparently, by the Union in its brief to this Court and by amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.426" offset="625037">It was completed before the contract expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.956" offset="639248">And the record so indicates if you look hard enough for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.326" offset="656697">Neither at the time of the merger nor thereafter, was any Interscience employee discharged, disciplined nor did any Interscience employee ever asserted nor has an Interscience employee ever asserted a grievance against Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.314" offset="728586">To this day, some two years after the event, since this suit was commenced, we have no notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.660" offset="758053">We have no idea whether, in fact, the Union in prosecuting this suit, does, in fact, represent any of the former Interscience employees who are now members of the Wiley Enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.014" offset="811447">This action was commenced on January 23rd, 1962, a week before the contract expired, about four months after the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.179" offset="852093">The action was commenced under our Section 90 of the New York Stock Corporation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.814" offset="874663">The allegation being that under the provisions of Section 90, Wiley, as a constituent company to a merger, was responsible for the obligations of the merged company.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.456" offset="921161">The complaint, and I'll read from page 5, alleges, I'm reading from the first full paragraph on page 5, alleges that notwithstanding the merger on the provisions of Section 90 of the Stock Corporation Law, the Company, since the consolidation, has failed and refused to recognize the validity of the collective bargaining agreement, currently, that is January 23rd, a week before the contract expired, a moot question because no controversies have arisen during the term of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.797" offset="1082598">And beyond January 30, that's an error in printing, and beyond January 31, 1962, which is the date of the expiration of the Interscience contract, and it's further alleged that Wiley has failed and refused to recognize the property rights of the former Interscience employees thereunder, that is under the contract expiring January 31, a week hence, and otherwise, beyond January 31, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.350" offset="1208822">And the relief that is demanded, and I read from page 10 in the record, is that the Union asks that Wiley, with whom it has no contract, submit to arbitration with the Union to arbitrate the following five questions, whether the seniority rights build up by the Interscience employees must be accorded to the employees now, that's January 23rd, a week before the contract expired and after January 31, 1962, that's after the contract expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.249" offset="1372348">I should add that in the briefs to this Court, the position has taken that not only do seniority rights build up as of January 31, 1962, not only are they claimed to carryover into the separate Wiley Enterprise, but it's claimed that the employees continue to have the rights to build up additional seniority rights after the expiration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.515" offset="1481435">The second demand is whether, as part of the wage structure of the employees, the Company, that is Wiley, is under an obligation to continue to make contributions to the District 65 Security and Welfare Plan now, January 23rd, and after January 31, the expiration of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.128" offset="1563878">(Inaudible) January 31.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.922" offset="1571088">It should be January 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.320" offset="1576626">That's -- that's our respondents' error in printing, no issue on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.932" offset="1599091">I should say that although the demand is that the Company continued to make contributions, Wiley never made contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.797" offset="1630542">And because the contributions were closed at the time of the merger, no further contributions made following October 2nd, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.049" offset="1663561">Third, whether the job security and the grievance provisions of the contract between the parties shall continue in full force in effect and the briefs make very clear that they're talking not only of up to January 31, which of course is moot, but thereafter, indefinitely and forever presumably.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.495" offset="1745377">And finally, DNE whether the Company must obligate itself to continue liable now and after January 31, 1962, to severance pay and to vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.775" offset="1794487">And I think it's clear from the briefs that the claim is made that they are talking of an accrual of additional severance pay and certainly additional vacation pay because all vacation pay that had been earned under the contract has always been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.252" offset="1868361">With the exception of the claim for the welfare plan contributions for the four-month period between the date of the merger, October 2nd, 1961 and January 31, all of the now issues, now and hereafter, are moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.591" offset="1921755">No controversies have ever risen.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.699" offset="1934190">What the Union really wants to arbitrate is whether the Interscience employees carryover to the Wiley Enterprise and retain permanently Wiley work in the Wiley Enterprise the working conditions which the Interscience Company granted, under the terms of the expired Interscience contract and which contract, of course, governed the Interscience Enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.479" offset="2041292">The case got into court and gets here not after trial but on a sort of mixed proceeding on the Union moving off under the Arbitration Act and under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.637" offset="2097925">We've assumed because the Court of Appeals has said that this is a Section 301 action and therefore, I think the Arbitration Act questions are --are not in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.747" offset="2134392">But the point is that no answer was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.129" offset="2147871">The time to extend an answer has been extended -- time to file an answer has been extended until after a final order in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.318" offset="2180681">There was no trial, case was heard on the complaint in order to show cause in the petition and opposing affidavits.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.188" offset="2872090">But it said, “We deny arbitration, first, because in our opinion, the claims that are sought to be arbitrated are not arbitrable within the scope of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.554" offset="2917543">And secondly, it said, “We find that none of the,” -- “I find”, the judge said, “None of the conditions precedent to arbitration have been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.027" offset="2963519">They have been totally ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.962" offset="2971251">There has been an abandonment of the procedure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="720.647" offset="2985984">And for that reason, the implication was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.847" offset="3002807">The case went up to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.769" offset="3010435">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.156" offset="3015973">The Court of Appeals directed arbitration, and it directed arbitration in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.771" offset="3042408">It said, "We note your questions, and we'll pass them all off to the arbitrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.486" offset="3325367">On page 90 in the record, he says, Judge Medina says for the majority that the terms of the agreement contemplated the arbitration of just such a dispute or controversy as the one before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.269" offset="3380433">I must assume, Your Honors, that what he was saying was, and I interpolate the form, I don't find it on this page, I think that he's saying is -- what he is saying is, had there not been a merger and had this claim been made against Interscience, where Interscience still an active company doing business, we would find that these claims fall within the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.341" offset="3476773">I must come to that conclusion because I turn over to pages 94 and 95 of the majority opinion, where the Court disposes of this aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.118" offset="3523793">And the Court says, in the paragraph in -- starting at the middle of the page, down toward the end of the fourth line, “We think and hold in the exercise of our duty to fashion a rule that it is not too much to expect and require this employer proceed to arbitration, with the Union, to determine whether the obligation to arbitrate, regarding the substantive terms of the contract, survived the consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.940" offset="3639150">And if so, just what rights survived?”</text>

            <text syncTime="887.767" offset="3654405">If you'll turn over to Judge Kaufman's concurring opinion on pages 110 and 111, he states it much more subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.125" offset="3695888">He says, and I'm reading from 110, “We hold that the collective bargaining agreement is not clearly removed from the scope of the arbitration the following questions, one, whether the collective bargaining agreement as a whole, survived the consolidation of Interscience and Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.376" offset="3772897">Two, if the agreement did survive, thereby imposing upon Wiley an obligation to arbitrate etcetera, then whether the Union had to comport with the conditions precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="932.648" offset="3833919">And to make more certain, what is certain in the next paragraph of his short opinion, he says, and I'm reading from that first full paragraph at probably on 131, "Our decision today, although there's no successor cause, permits the arbitrator to imply their successor cause, if under the circumstances, he thinks the implication is proper."</text>
            <text syncTime="959.393" offset="3940916">And he continues, "It is this power to read the successor cause into the collective agreement which makes Wiley a proper party defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="968.698" offset="3978115">And he goes on and says in which makes the Union a proper party plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.439" offset="3993161">And he says that if the arbitrator finds that the contract did not, in fact, carryover, then of course, Wiley shouldn't have been sued and the Union shouldn't have sued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.608" offset="4729814">Interscience business, the industrial enterprise, what my friend, Mr. Feller terms in what we call the continuing employing enterprise and the -- and the separate collective bargaining unit disappeared as a result of the absorption of the Interscience business into Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.538" offset="4813511">And we say this is really no different than if Wiley had, in fact, purchased the Interscience business as it could have with the -- exactly the same results incidentally, under the Internal Revenue Code because in either of that, it would have been a deferred recognition of (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.991" offset="4887385">Had they purchased it and given for the assets, given to the stockholders 20% of the Wiley stock even under amicus' brief, they concede.And in that case, they would have no claim against Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.098" offset="4951751">Now, you've found me into the heart of my case, and I -- I welcome it because my first point is that the Court -- that the Court obviously, erroneously gave away it's jurisdiction to determine whether Wiley made a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.134" offset="5015907">And obviously and clearly, it should not have referred back to the arbitrator to determine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.383" offset="5220916">The first question is whether the Interscience obligation to arbitrate is binding on Wiley, whereas a proximate result of the merger of Interscience into Wiley, the business and workforce of Interscience, was absorbed by Wiley's business, and the Interscience Industrial Community was dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.471" offset="5313285">My view of the question is not the broad question that amicus says, does the contract as a whole carryover it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.326" offset="6180655">I say to you, sir, what is the fact, that the integration was commenced according to plan, pre-planning and plan was commenced on October 2nd at 9 o'clock the date of the merger and was carried through over a period of four months until the first week in January when the Interscience offices were actually closed and the employees who were still remaining in Interscience, some of them are already having been moved over to Wiley, those remaining were finally moved over to Wiley.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.411" offset="6609063">Now, we say that there are four questions that this case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.162" offset="6627976">The first one is the one that we've been talking about which is whether where, as a proximate result of the merger, not on the date of the merger but as a proximate result of the merger, the Interscience Enterprise is discontinued, can there be an obligation on the part of the successor Wiley to arbitrate under the Interscience contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.586" offset="6709687">The second question we add, is whether in any event, even assuming that there might be some carryover of employees' rights, can the Union, who at the time it filed it suit, was no longer the employees' collective bargaining representative because these 40 people had been merged into a workforce of 400 or doing similar work, can the Union arbitrate claims in their behalf when those claims relate as they do here, not to liquidated claims but to working conditions in the Wiley Enterprise?</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.724" offset="6874258">Different question, there maybe carryover rights, possibly, none is yet been decided, in hearing an employees following the termination of a contract and before a new contract is negotiated, but if the Union in the meantime is no longer the collective bargaining representative of the employees, can it commence an action in their behalf?</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.850" offset="6962761">And we think, as we argue at length in our brief and reply brief under the cases Montgomery Ward, Keenan, Modal, Glendale, we think that it obviously cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.704" offset="7018141">The third question is, and here, we come to your Steelworkers cases, whether these claims to permanent working conditions in the Interscience Enterprise spelled out by faith from an Interscience contract although without pointing to any specific provisions in the contract, whether it's conceivable that it can be said that the claim to a carryover of these permanent working conditions to a different employee enterprise can be a claim made under the Interscience contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.109" offset="7171845">And if it's not, it's obviously not made within the scope of the contract and obviously, therefore, it's not arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.841" offset="7202774">And the fourth question that we present to Your Honors, is a question that you have now as yet decided on what the Union calls “procedural arbitrability” and who is to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.087" offset="7259721">But we suggest that perhaps you don't have to get to that question because we think apart from arguments pro and contrary and they're argued in full in our briefs and in the Union's and amicus', we don't think this is really a procedural arbit -- arbritrability case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.061" offset="7327640">We think this is a case clearly where arbitration was abandoned as a remedy and where clearly the Union elected to bargain with the Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.350" offset="7372779">The Company performance talking to the Union on a -- without prejudice basis, without prejudice to explain that the contract was then at an end, and it recognized no rights under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.142" offset="7423979">And that whereas here, after four months of such without prejudice bargaining, the Union got what it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.881" offset="7454908">We think that now, a week before the contract when it files it suit to compel arbitration, never having demanding it, we think this is not a case of procedural arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.338" offset="7504750">We think this is just clear as I said before, abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.078" offset="7523662">This is a wide territory that -- that we cover in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.150" offset="7543933">And each one of these points really makes a case by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.830" offset="7562742">But if it's agreeable to the Court, I'll choose to argue at -- at length from the question that, this was the subject of a colloquy between Mr. Justice White and me because I think this is a -- the four new questions, this is probably the newest and that is, how do you reach Wiley?</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.912" offset="7683009">The Union says, and I distinguish District 65, Mr. Livingston from amicus, the Union says, very simple, “We sue under Section 90.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.551" offset="7721566">The Court of Appeals said, “Well, that doesn't make sense in a labor case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.910" offset="7735045">And amicus says, “It doesn't make sense in a labor case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.943" offset="7747166">Now, I think that this Court must agree that the -- this difficult question involving all of these facets of relationships between company, successor company, successor company and employees and successor company and collective bargaining agent can't be decided by a -- of the merger and consolidation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.343" offset="7836714">One of the several states obviously have to look to more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.916" offset="7855000">So I think the fact is -- is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.825" offset="7874644">I think clearly, the question that we have here is not one of corporate or commercial law but it's a question of labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.653" offset="7905991">That does not depend on tactical niceties of a consolidation statute nor we suggest upon the manner, upon the manner by which one company acquires another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.262" offset="7960430">And here, although I argue for the Company, here perhaps, we break ground and argue what many other companies might know or assert what many other companies, counsel for companies might not be willing to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.011" offset="8023437">I want to say first, there are four possibilities as I've seen them of how you can reach Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.078" offset="8043708">First is merger and consolidation statute, I think that's clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.986" offset="8063352">Second, you can do what the Court of Appeals did which is to say, “Well, Court won't pass on the question that the arbitrator decide everything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.455" offset="8097207">I think that also is clearly wrong, and I think so does amicus say it's clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.259" offset="8124374">The Court must decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.726" offset="8130226">The arbitrator can't decide whether a party is to be bound to a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.176" offset="8152064">And the fact that Wiley is charged here, not as the signing party but as a successor of the signing party, doesn't author the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.699" offset="8194173">If Interscience were doing business, the Court would have to decide did Interscience make the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.915" offset="8223013">Interscience is no more, Wiley is being sued, the Court must therefore have to decide, is Wiley bound by express assumption of contract, by the terms of the contract or by operation of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.747" offset="8282363">This is the threshold finding which obviously is a judicial one and not an arbitral one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.922" offset="8307022">The third possibility of holding Wiley is, if you adapt the rule presently in effect, in the lower courts and the Board, and that is that absent a case of alter ego, and this clearly is a good faith merger, except in the case of an alter ego, a purchaser of assets is never to be held to the contract of the predecessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.114" offset="8423842">Now, it's true that those are contract bar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.167" offset="8440038">Those cases were decided in the framework of whether or not the purchaser company, reinstating the operations of the old company, could claim the benefit of the contract that the seller had made with the Union or whether --</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.657" offset="9922017">Well, you came pretty close to it in Humphrey-Moore, I thought.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.988" offset="9955349">In any event, the rule that we're talking of, the rule that we're suggesting is that, if following the merger, the separate enterprise, they're separately continued and the collective bargaining unit is continued as a separate unit, it would be appropriate to hold the successor whether he's a successor by merger or purchase or reorganizational whatever, bound to that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.485" offset="10065272">But we're suggesting that where, as a proximate result of the merger or the purchase, the acquired enterprise is dissolved and -- and absorbed completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.426" offset="10121070">And the collective bargaining unit looses its identity, then we're saying there can be no carryover.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.555" offset="10193586">He says that if at 9 o'clock on October 2nd, when you file, and I'm exaggerating a little, he says that if on the date of the merger, October 2nd, you terminated the Interscience Enterprise by moving the 40 people over to the Wiley offices right then, 9 o'clock that day, and the Court has to dismiss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.992" offset="10283342">But he says, “If you didn't move them over that day, then Wiley has become bound by the contract and when Wiley moves them over the next day, it has to arbitrate all the questions, which would not have had to arbitrate, had it moved in at the day of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.826" offset="10354709">We say this can't be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.652" offset="10362023">The rule has to be that if this rule of the continuing employing enterprise or an industrial community is to be adapted and we think it a logical rule, you must give -- you must examine all of the facts and circumstances, as Mr. Feller suggest, and you must examine them over a reasonable period of time and not just at the precise moment of the filing of the merger papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.367" offset="10456795">And you, is the Court, the trial court and obviously and not the arbitrator because it's a juridical question involving whether or not party is legally bound to arbitrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.869" offset="11962807">I'm saying that if you analyze what they're saying that Wiley, after the contract expiration date, must pay the 9% of wages into the Union plan, that Wiley must install a seniority plan and must install grievance and arbitration procedures following the date of the contract because they were provided for in an expired contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.618" offset="12093837">What they're really saying, I think is this, this does not appear in their briefs, they are saying there had -- Interscience never merged and had the Interscience contract expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.361" offset="12140857">And had there been that hiatus between the expiration of the Interscience contract and the -- and the negotiation and signature to a new contract, that during that hiatus, because the Inter -- Interscience Enterprise had continued and because the employees continued to work as a separate bargaining unit and because the Union continued to represent the employees even though the contract had expired, they are asserting some sort of right of a carryover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.813" offset="12282650">But by the -- on the very face of that claim, these claims cannot carryover to a different enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.890" offset="12322983">So that I'm saying on the face of the claim, on the very face of the claim, it is premised on a continuation of the Interscience Enterprise and when it appears as it does appear here, that the Interscience Enterprise is no more, it must then appear that the claim is not the within the scope of the Interscience contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.865" offset="12402813">They could just as well be making a claim against the United States Steel Corporation, because if the Interscience Enterprise has not carried over to Wiley, then there is no nexus, there's no connection, you'll never reach Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.639" offset="12457880">And because they are claiming to arbitrate under the Interscience contract, then they're asserting the claim against United States Steel or Wiley, the claim obviously is not within the scope of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="4048.720" offset="16298297">Each two years have, in the example I was about to propose to Your Honor, there's been negotiations for wages and other things and the -- the most important attributes of a collective bargaining relationship is a pension plan, is the fact that when I get to be 65 or more, I'll have something to -- to protect me in my old age.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.427" offset="16377083">So we give up rights for -- for increased wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="4072.756" offset="16394428">We give up rights for a number of other things so as to get that pension plan, to get those pension plan contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.607" offset="16421804">And -- and we -- and we get those rights in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.023" offset="16435493">After 25 years of service, the company, lets say, says “No, I'm not going -- I'm not going to bargain with you anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.840" offset="16462764">We're all through, we're not going to make the more contributions to your pension plan”, as -- as emphasized in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4096.959" offset="16491186">And as -- as the employee to left high and dry, are all the -- the rights which has been created, all the promises that were made from all the years of -- of bargaining, all to go for north, we say there was a consideration on actual legal consideration, a quid pro quo, every two years for that pension plan contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.461" offset="16565164">And now, there's a mere fact that the plan -- that the Company's contract has terminated according to a termination clause in the contract, does that mean that were -- were employees go through?</text>

            <text syncTime="4139.590" offset="16661713">We really shouldn't be engaged in this discussion at all because this is the ultimate -- this is -- this is the kind of discussion I expect to be arguing and talking to when I get before the arbiter, if I had to get to there with Your Honors permission of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.218" offset="16732244">So I -- I say that -- in addition to our letter, I'd like to read you or Mr. Lieb's affidavit at page 58 of the record, this is again in connection with the physical transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.189" offset="16840077">And he here is, on September 19, 1961 talking to me and to my associates and here's -- here's what he said, “I said that although the physical transfer for me to sign to Wiley premises, would not be made until later of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.938" offset="16899114">It was Wiley's position that on October 2nd, automatically, without anything more, on October 2nd when the merger became effective, the collective bargaining unit would disappear at Interscience and be merged and be absorbed by the larger Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.158" offset="16951986">So here, I've read Your Honors two statements by the Company itself telling us that there is not going to be disintegration, desecration as of the date of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.333" offset="16988662">And that is why Judge Medina in his opinion states that the position, on page 89, he states that the position of the Company was that the agreement automatically, this is an exact quotation, "Automatically terminate for all purposes, the agreement by the consolidation."</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.891" offset="17062954">So I say to you -- Your Honors that that has been the legal question of law that Judge Medina passed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.067" offset="17087613">There's no factual issues before him because the Company's, as he finds and as their letter shows, took that position and on October 2nd, there was an automatic termination, Union was through, the employees are through, no more rights, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.199" offset="17160129">And the fact is that nobody knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.532" offset="17165458">The record does not show when it did take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.753" offset="17178415">Now, I'd like Your Honors to bear with me while I explain Mr. Lieb's statement that there's no prior demand for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.782" offset="17222510">I concede that there was no formal document asking for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.704" offset="17242154">That is true and that possibly what he refers to, although I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.429" offset="17261066">The fact is from June 27th of 1961, when I addressed my first letter to Mr. Lieb advising him that there were knowledge of the impending merger and our insistence upon the continuation of the contract, upon our insistence upon the continuation of the rights of the employees until down to the very commence of the action, we were engaged in almost one long continuous process of -- of talking, of negotiations, of trying to work this problem out, of -- of advancing into each other's arguments and issues as to what the rights of employees were informed to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.713" offset="17406203">And this was not held at the level of the shop steward or the Union employee in the shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.842" offset="17430758">Of course, it would be slightly ridiculous to think that such a problem could be handled in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.163" offset="17452074">This was handled at top level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.508" offset="17457403">Mr. Lieb, myself, Mr. Livingston, the President of our Union, Mr. Robinson, the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union and Mr. Lobdell, who was Vice President and Treasurer, I believe, of Wiley.</text>
