            <text syncTime="32.470" offset="233200">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.987" offset="239365">It's just a reference to the last case.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.303" offset="256606">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review that court's affirmance of a judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.403" offset="313031">The District Court had entered an order dismissing the complaint on a motion by plaintiff for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.771" offset="342497">We think both of the courts below were in error and that summary judgment should have been entered in favor of plaintiff against the defendant, Farr Whitlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.437" offset="389099">The facts are somewhat complex, but I shall take the liberty of sketching them in rather quickly and only in broad outline because the details are really not necessary for a full understanding of the critical issue that confronts the Court on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.003" offset="463391">Some time prior to 19-- to July of 1960 and about April or May, a sugar brokerage firm in New York by the name of Farr Whitlock entered into two contracts with a wholly owned subsidiary of a Cuban corporation, Compania Azucarera Vertientes-Ca Aguey, which is referred to in this proceeding by the initials C.A.V.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.050" offset="575613">Although Farr Whitlock was a sugar broker, it was buying this sugar on its own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.270" offset="600482">Under the terms of the contract, the sugar was to be shipped to Morocco, but payment was to be made in New York upon presentation of the bill of ladings and other shipping documents accompanied by a sight draft for the purchase price of the sugar in accordance with normal commercial practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.148" offset="675924">The price of the sugar was approximately $175,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.713" offset="702255">The record shows that C.A.V. was incorporated in Cuba and that about 90% or in excess of 90% of its stockholders are said to be residents of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.821" offset="758680">There is nothing into the -- in the record as to the nationality of those stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.873" offset="782817">On July 6, the Republic of Cuba adopted a decree authorizing the nationalization of property owned by nationals of the United States or properties in which the United States nationals had an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.305" offset="848541">Under the terms of the decree, compensation was to be paid by the issuance of 20-year-bonds and the funds behind the bonds were to come from the proceeds of sales of sugar to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.291" offset="916564">On that very same day, the President of the United States signed the Sugar Act of 1960, which sharply curtailed the purchases of sugar by the United States from Cuba, although the Act, of course, had been passed by Congress a few days previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.559" offset="993573">One month later, on August 6, by a resolution made pursuant to the decree that I have mentioned, the property of C.A.V. and 25 other corporations were nationalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.654" offset="1049997">This was one of a long series of decrees, which are -- some of which are referred to in a footnote at page 39 of petitioner's brief, which began in May of 1959 and which, in the end, transformed Cuba from a capitalist to a socialist economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.212" offset="1128260">On the day of the decree, the sugar was being loaded on a freighter which was anchored in territorial waters of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.284" offset="1176534">Actually, the loading was not completed until August 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.107" offset="1195760">The ship remained in territorial waters until August 11 and, on that day, new contracts were signed by Farr Whitlock with a Cuban governmental bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.229" offset="1252289">These contracts were identical in terms, even as to the date, with the original contract signed between Farr Whitlock and C.A.V. and we contend that this contract recognized the ownership of the Cuban government in this sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.512" offset="1325432">A day or two later, the sugar went off to Morocco.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.799" offset="1338598">The bills of lading were assigned to the petitioner which is the National Bank of Cuba and they were sent to Societe General, a French bank which acted as the New York agent of the petitioner, together with a sight draft in the sum of $175,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.562" offset="1413622">While the bills of lading were in transit and, on August 16, 1960, in a proceeding commenced in the New York State Supreme Court, a receiver was appointed over the New York assets of C.A.V. pursuant to Section 977 (b) of the Civil Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.227" offset="1500244">As a result of subsequent proceedings, that receivership was set aside and vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.087" offset="1523754">That happened after the Court of Appeals decision on this case, the court-- Supreme Court in Kings County New York holding that the receivership was improper in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.378" offset="1572864">On August 26, Farr Whitlock and C.A.V. entered into a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.846" offset="1602748">By the terms of which, Farr Whitlock agreed that if it could get possession of the sugar or of the proceeds, it would hold those proceeds for C.A.V., instead of turning them over to Societe General.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.171" offset="1668054">In return, C.A.V. agreed to hold Farr Whitlock harmless for any loss it might suffer as a result of this transaction and also agreed to pay it 10% of the proceeds so that, although Farr Whitlock has been referred to in this proceeding on a number of occasions as only as stakeholder, actually, it stands to gain some of the sum of $17,500 if it should prevail in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.230" offset="1776306">On August 29, by means of a trick which we think equaled fraud, it certainly resembles fraud, Farr Whitlock managed to get possession of the bills of lading without actually honoring the sight draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.705" offset="1862196">Using the bills of lading, it negotiated them, sold the sugar, and received $175,000 for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.643" offset="1897932">It refused to pay that $175,000 over to Societe General and this lawsuit, which alleges a conversion of the bills of lading and the sugar that they represented, was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.501" offset="1953416">A day or two later, the money was turned over to the receiver and, upon determination of the receivership, the money which, together with interest in course, now amounts to something over $200,000 was turned up to a-- over to an escrow agent who now holds those funds awaiting the decision of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.799" offset="2310562">It was purely a collection agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.268" offset="2324459">There seem to be no question of fact in this case and, accordingly, petitioner moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.172" offset="2352044">Farr Whitlock defended on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.353" offset="2360822">First, it claimed that the federal court did not have jurisdiction because of the pendency of the New York State receivership and, second, it raised the series of issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.890" offset="2402931">Neither of those grounds is raised in this Court and we assume that they have been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.289" offset="2432502">The district court first considered the question of jurisdiction and decided in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.074" offset="2455698">It then considered the factual questions and decided those in favor of petitioner, holding that there were no triable issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.137" offset="2487881">We would have thought that, under these circumstances, summary judgment would have resulted in favor of the petitioner that the Court then went on to decide the case on a ground that had not been urged before it, that had not been argued before it, that had not been briefed before it, and that I don't think that any counsel had even thought about it because, to us at least, the law seemed so clear that there was no point in arguing the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.156" offset="2599999">Despite a long line of cases of this Court and the federal courts known generally as the act of state cases, and I shall of course refer to them again later in my argument, it held that there was an exception to the act of state case, namely that they did not apply where the decree of a foreign government violated international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.953" offset="2691218">It then examined the decree of the Cuban Government in this case and it found that violation of international law had indeed existed in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.684" offset="2730088">First, that the Cuban decree was discriminatory against citizens of the United States; second, that it was retaliatory and third, that it confiscated a property without adequate compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.170" offset="2784005">The Court of Appeals affirmed on somewhat different ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.011" offset="2803440">It held that the Act of State Doctrine was subject to another exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.175" offset="2828100">This was the exception which it, the same court, had found, in about 1947 I think, in the second Bernstein case, and that's reported in 210 F.2d 375.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.665" offset="2882017">I shall refer to that again later, although I think that the major burden of the argument, at least the major burden of the brief on this subject, will probably be carried by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.559" offset="2921618">In any event, the court found that the Bernstein exception was present here, relying on fragments of correspondents which were submitted to it, not by us of course and not by Farr Whitlock, but by an amicus which had sought and received leave to file an amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.017" offset="3003434">And, these fragments of correspondents were handed up to the court and the court relied on these to hold that the Bernstein exception applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.073" offset="3035617">It then went on to decide that the Cuban decree had violated international law and, while it didn't find the same three violations of international law that the district court had find, it sort of grouped all of them together and, to use its language, it held that there was a violation of international law for a company to fail to pay adequate compensation for the property it seizes from a particular class of aliens when the purpose for the seizure of the property is to retaliate against the homeland of those aliens and when the result of such seizure is to discriminate against them only.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.392" offset="3212936">In another words, it took the three grounds that the Court of Appeals said had found and locked them all together to make one single ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.905" offset="3259016">In our opinion, the basic question before the Court here is the Act of State Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.628" offset="3285870">Both our brief and, to an even greater extent, the brief of the Solicitor General enters into a rather extensive consideration of the history of the Act of State Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.351" offset="3336756">Both of us say that this doctrine really dates from 1674 in an English case.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.290" offset="3364551">But, in modern times, it may be said to date from Underhill against Hernandez, although there's some language in the Schooner Exchange which does seem to foreshadow this same doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.058" offset="3427558">Now, there are many, many formulations of the Act of State Doctrine in the decision for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.904" offset="3455039">In Oetjen against Central Leather Company, for example, this Court said the conduct of one independent government cannot be successfully questioned in the course of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.876" offset="3502895">Mr. Justice Holmes earlier, in the American Banana Company case, had said “the general and almost universal rule is that the character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the law of the country in which the act is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.570" offset="3577605">”There is similar language in Shapleigh against Mier, in the Belmont case, in the Pink case, all of them in this Court and, most recently, in the case of Pons against the Republic of Cuba which was decided by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and certiorari was denied by this Court, I believe, in 1961 and it presents a Cuba situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.153" offset="3659943">The others, of course, represented either Latin American nationalizations or Russian nationalizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.805" offset="4930644">For example, there is a citation -- there is a reference to Mr. Justice Brennan's decision in Baker against Carr in which the opinion makes some reference to the language in the Ricoeur case, I believe, and says that this language is too broad that the court frequently does handle problems involving foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.047" offset="5015594">Now, I'm not arguing that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.336" offset="5032730">All we are saying, so far as this case in concerned, that our court should recognize the validity of the Acts of other states disposing of title to property within their territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.278" offset="5080482">That's all I have to say in this case and that's all that I am asking the Court to rule on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.022" offset="6315447">On July 24, 1961, an Eastern Airline plane was hijacked by an armed passenger who took the plane from Miami to Havana together with all of the passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.455" offset="6365184">The passengers came back the next day but, on August 16th, the plane was returned by the Cuban Government after a great deal of diplomatic negotiation between the Swiss and Czech as these things are handled now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.784" offset="6418474">On the very next day, August 17th, a Cuban freighter was hijacked and was brought into Norfolk harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.357" offset="6464763">This presented a political situation of, I think, considerable importance and it was made even more critical by the fact that, on board that freighter, there was a cargo of sugar and it was owned by United Fruit Company or at least United Fruit Company claimed to own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.221" offset="6536234">It was a cargo of sugar that had been nationalized by the very same decree that we are here considering, and United Fruit came in and said “we don't care about the freighter, but the sugar belongs to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.990" offset="6591300">” Now, the case of United Fruit was just as strong and just as weak as the case of C.A.V. in this re -- in this circumstance. Every single word of the C.A. brief -- C.A.V. brief, between page 12 and page 58, could have been written by United Fruit merely with a substitution of the name United Fruit for C.A.V.</text>
