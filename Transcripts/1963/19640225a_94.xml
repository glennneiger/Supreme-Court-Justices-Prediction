            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 94, United States, Appellant, versus El Paso Natural Gas Company, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.839" offset="154728">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="14.406" stopTime="561.579">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="14.406" offset="160998">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.040" offset="175522">This is a major antitrust case in which the Government attacks the merger of two natural gas pipeline companies under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.258" offset="228394">The acquiring company is El Paso Natural Gas Company, which at the time of the acquisition was one of the two largest natural gas companies in the country and which was then the only company actually supplying natural gas -- interstate natural gas to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.028" offset="307493">The acquired company is Pacific Northwest Pipeline Company, then the only large interstate natural gas company west of the Rocky Mountains and a company which was seeking to enter the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.716" offset="386278">Another aspect of the litigation growing out of this merger was here two years ago when the Court held that set aside in order of the Federal Power Commission, on the ground that it should not have preceded to approve the merger while an antitrust complaint was being prosecuted by the Department of Justice in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.147" offset="471960">The question presented here is whether the acquisition itself violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act because it was an acquisition which may tend substantially to lessen competition in the -- in promoting projects for the sale of natural gas to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.069" offset="555656">The essential facts, at least the outline of the facts is really quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.435" offset="581151">We start with the California market for natural gas which was an -- an immense and very rapidly expanding market.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.836" offset="626709">In 1950 for example, six years before the merger, the consumption was 684 million cubic feet daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.174" offset="664116">In 1955, it was one billion cubic feet daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.175" offset="680103">In 1960, 1.3 billion, in 1965, it's estimated it'll be 1.6 billion and in 1970, two billion cubic feet daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.737" offset="730363">It's increasing in other words at an annual rate of approximately 200 million cubic feet a day, much the most dynamic as I understand it in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.441" offset="777174">More than half of California's consumption comes from out-of-state.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.988" offset="799326">It's been 50%, 61% and it can be expected in all probability, but with no certainty to continue to be more than half.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.393" offset="840913">Natural gas is a principal source of energy, it being dependent on interstate pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.391" offset="876962">California's concern that it should not receive all its gas from one company or that it should be dependent even on one or two suppliers, is a very natural one.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.509" offset="917400">It's one that's been often expressed, the Federal Power Commission and expressed here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.027" offset="947493">El Paso, at the time of the merger, was, as I have said, one of the largest natural gas pipeline companies in the country in --at assets of just under a billion dollars, 903 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.551" offset="1005589">Its pipelines are shown on this separate map that I asked the clerk to distribute only because it was a convenient way of showing where these two companies run.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.283" offset="1052505">I think, if anyone started looking in some of the details, he might be misled, and all I'm trying to do is show the main outlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.953" offset="1087195">El Paso, you'll see, is marked in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.907" offset="1099003">Its pipelines run from the San Juan Basin, a natural gas basin in Southwest in Colorado and Northwest in New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle and the Permian Basin in West Texas, out to the California border.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.740" offset="1178311">At the California border, the gas is picked up either by Pacific Gas and Electric Company which is a distribution company that has virtually a monopoly of the distribution of gas in Northern California or by what are known as the Southern Companies, two affiliated companies which have virtually a monopoly of the distribution of gas in Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.905" offset="1302967">Pacific Northwest was incorporated in 1959 and was certificated in 1954, initially with a view to serving the Northwestern states, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.637" offset="1381961">Its pipeline, you will see, is marked in blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.267" offset="1396485">It runs from a connection with Canadian companies at the border at Sumas, Washington down paralleling the western edge of the Rocky Mountains, down to the San Juan Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.661" offset="1458030">Pacific Northwest had four assets or advantages that are worthy of note.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.463" offset="1493243">In the first place, it was unique, I think, and that it had access both to the Canadian Gas which was becoming of increasing importance and to the San Juan Basin, another important source of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.785" offset="1550503">It lay adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and therefore adjacent to important future reserves of gas, which were then beginning to be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.814" offset="1602644">Having gas fields in either end, this was a flexible line, the line could be -- the gas could be made to flow in either direction or from the two ends to some point in the center where it might be carried off by a bridge line.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.023" offset="1667427">And finally, I would point out that as these things go, while Pacific Northwest had no line to California, it was not far from the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.211" offset="1716224">I should say in that connection, to avoid any possible confusion that these two little orange lines going off from Pacific Northwest, one running south through Oregon and the other running across to Nevada, ought to be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.639" offset="1785919">They are little bitsy pipelines and they have no earthly importance in this proceeding or is a possible bridges from Pacific to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.164" offset="1819982">And if we'd had some convenient way to eliminate them, I'd have stricken them right off the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.754" offset="1850389">Almost from the time of its incorporation and certainly from the time of its certification, Pacific had a very real interest in the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.568" offset="1905664">In 1954, it engaged in discussions with Pacific Gas and Electric, with the view to bring down a supply of gas from Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.839" offset="1942758">Later that year, those preliminary conversations gave way to an agreement between Pacific, El Paso, and the Canadian company, Westcoast Transmission Company, to impart 300 million cubic feet a day through Mountain Home, Idaho which would be a point about halfway on Pacific's Line through Idaho and then to bring that gas down probably through Reno to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.754" offset="2066369">Again I say the orange line has nothing to do that -- with that although it's about the location.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.032" offset="2091551">That agreement was described by one of Pacific's officers in a report to a stockholder as having this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.417" offset="2124988">El Paso's California market will be protected against future competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.520" offset="2145468">And if the agreement results in all parties now working together for a common end rather than fighting each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.952" offset="2179218">This was only a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.220" offset="2188204">The agreement had been signed but it was felt through because the distribution companies refused to take the gas at the point at which the transmission companies wanted to lever -- to deliver it to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.004" offset="2247346">Then in 1956, as I shall describe in more detail later, Pacific negotiated with Southern California Edison, a large user of gas and reached a tentative agreement on July 30, 1956 to impart gas to California, building a pipeline, provided that a -- another purchaser along with Edison could be found.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="577.641" offset="2413902">It fell through because the Southern Companies wouldn't take it at the point of delivery that El Paso wanted to deliver it, having brought it down through Westcoast Transmission in part of Pacific's line.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.640" offset="2469909">They wanted to deliver it farther north than they would take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.549" offset="2493524">It fell through in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.307" offset="2508570">It would've been before these discussions with Edison.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.943" offset="2523094">As I say, I shall refer to the discussions with Edison at more length in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.994" offset="2551306">It's worth noting that when the president of El Paso learned of the negotiations between the Pacific and Edison, he went to Edison, told Edison that he knew about the negotiations, that he wanted to hold the market there in Southern California which he had all up at that time, and was prepared to supply it, and that he would resist the efforts of anybody else to come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.864" offset="2718804">In fact all that I have mentioned would have required the construction of a line taking off somewhere from Pacific's line to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.411" offset="2764988">I'll explain that more length in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.281" offset="2780453">El Paso's interest in acquiring Pacific and indeed its negotiations to acquire Pacific commenced almost as soon as Pacific had a certificate to build this pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.283" offset="2840534">El Paso made studies in 1955 and in December 1955, it made an offer to acquire all of Pacific's stock, giving five of each share for every nine of Pacific's.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.110" offset="2895809">That offer was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.449" offset="2905213">In 1956, while Pacific was negotiating with Edison, El Paso picked up and Pacific picked up the previous negotiations for a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.708" offset="2958190">On November 8, 1956, an agreement was closed whereby El Paso was to surrender seven of each gift -- seven of each shares for every eight shares of Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.396" offset="3016913">That agreement was complete -- well, it was completed on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.525" offset="3033422">It was carried out during the ensuing months.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.875" offset="3046902">By May 1957, El Paso had acquired 99 and a fraction percent of the stock of Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.667" offset="3086085">In July 1957, the Department of Justice started this suit against El Paso, complaining that the merger violated Section 7 and seeking ultimately an order requiring El Paso to divest itself from the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.506" offset="3165393">El Paso then decided to acquire all the assets of Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.909" offset="3190993">The theory, I take it, was that while the stock acquisition did not require the approval of a -- the Federal Power Commission, an asset acquisition would require its approval and then approval in turn, the lawyer's thought, would result in immunizing the acquisition under the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.258" offset="3276361">The Federal Power Commission did approve the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.156" offset="3292035">The order was then brought here by the State of California and this Court set -- assigned the order of the Federal Power Commission holding first that the Federal Power Commission should not have proceeded while the antitrust case was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.558" offset="3353579">And also holding squarely, that Federal Power Commission approval of an asset acquisition does not give any immunity under the antitrust laws, so that the order was wiped out and the way was cleared for trial in the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.939" offset="3427140">Now, the two or three events that occurred after the merger, that I think it would be convenient to explain at this point because we will be referring to them in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.409" offset="3481057">One, Mr. Justice Brennan, relates to this dotted line that you mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.736" offset="3506343">That represents what was known as the Rock Springs project.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.317" offset="3524629">That was a project developed by El Paso after the merger for bringing gas from a number of sources into California to meet an expected increment in the California demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.851" offset="3590771">Some of the gas that would have been used in that project would have come from Canada through Pacific's pipelines, but not all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.855" offset="3626820">Some of it was clearly dependent upon that gas that El Paso would have provided from sources not available to Pacific, but some of it was also Canadian gas and I shall argue --</text>

            <text syncTime="983.112" offset="4035793">We have our doubts but it's there as a company and it's an independent company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.896" offset="4158986">So that those are events that occurred after the merging that were entered, that it was -- were proved at the hearing in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.552" offset="4197543">After the case went back, the District Court received evidence, some oral, parts of it from the record in these previous proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.829" offset="4242683">And after hearing argument announced for the bench that he would rule against the prosecution that there was no violation of Section 7, directed the defendant to prepare findings of fact of conclusion which I understand were submitted -- were signed as the defendant submitted them and then we brought the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.628" offset="4341844">The question presented as we see it is solely one of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.111" offset="4367862">We do not attack any I think, certainly not more than one of the findings as unsupported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.869" offset="4410807">We argue that a number of the conclusions rest on a misconception of the principles governing the application of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.190" offset="4452080">We argue that a number of the other findings as I shall explain are irrelevant because they missed the essential point because of an error of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.040" offset="4495548">But we do not seek to go back of what is undisputed evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.788" offset="4522506">Our case rests essentially on two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.883" offset="4538911">First, we say that competition in the pipeline industry consists of rivalry in promoting future projects to transport and deliver large quantities of gas for a long period, 20 years or more on the average often through facilities to be constructed and beginning some time in the future, two, three and perhaps as far away as five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.290" offset="4644551">In other words, this isn't simply the sale of units of gas today to be delivered tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.733" offset="4666284">It looks to long-term projects to bring gas to a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.519" offset="4689481">Second, bearing in mind the nature of competition, we submit that El Paso's acquisition of what was then the only major pipeline company west of the Rocky and seeking to enter the California market, a company which was actively seeking to enter the California market made such a change in the structure of the market, as to require as a matter of law the conclusion that it would tend substantially to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.869" offset="4830856">Let me first say just a word more about the nature of competition in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.234" offset="4856351">As I say, what we think it consist of and I don't think that the defendants, the appellees disagree, is the promotion of rival projects among producers, one end of the bridge and among users or distributing companies at the other ends of the bridge, to put together links bringing the necessary gas to the market, and then to secure the approval of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.759" offset="4974425">It's quite different from competition in the sale of shoes to shoe stores located in the same neighborhood are engaged in selling shoes that they have in stock, the costumers now for delivering either immediately or in a very short time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.023" offset="5047463">Even shoe manufacturers, while they are selling next season's supply to the retailer still are selling shoes which are either manufactured or very shortly to be manufactured, they're to be delivered, a few lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.937" offset="5115068">They're not engaged in competition that constructs and operate shoe factories over a long period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.287" offset="5152475">Here, the gas sold today is not sold in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.385" offset="5180897">It wouldn't be sold in competition even if there were 10 pipelines leading into California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.544" offset="5205556">The gas that El Paso is delivering today is earmarked by Federal Power Commission certificate to come from a particular source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.756" offset="5242441">It will go through a certificated pipeline that will be delivered to a particular distributor or possibly a user, and its use will frequently have been marked by the certificate itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.406" offset="5300955">The rivalry therefore comes in these vast projects for the future, things like the Rock Springs Project where there was real rivalry even though it was ultimately disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.426" offset="5353096">The rivalry is in buying or acquiring large quantities of gas in the producing areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.163" offset="5387995">Rivalry in selling is in selling long term arrangements to the distribution companies or possibly to the users.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.292" offset="5420492">There's rivalry in planning alternate transmission lines, it -- but it bring linking different sources of supply with different markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.340" offset="5456750">The long range impact of that may have considerable significance to the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.884" offset="5478902">Nor thus a competition end as we visualize it when the contract is signed because there is still rivalry in submitting the proposals to the regulatory agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.610" offset="5533863">Indeed, one of the things that seems to us in -- of critical importance in applying the policy of the antitrust laws to this kind of industry is that the regulatory agencies should have a number of alternatives available so that they can choose between Project A and Project B or Project A, B, C and D and should not be limited only to what one company puts forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.576" offset="5649638">And it's that fillings I suggested before I think that indicates the interest to the State of California in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.674" offset="5686105">The nature of competition in this industry has -- carries three important consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.181" offset="5716093">In the first place, it means that competition is likely to be episodic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.520" offset="5737409">As the market builds up an additional increment of unfilled demand large enough to warrant the expansion of pipeline facilities or in a dynamic market like this usually the construction of new facilities, then there will be a period of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.254" offset="5816404">There was such a flurry in 1955 and 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.304" offset="5836570">Today, there is intense rivalry looking to the increment of demand which will have to be satisfied beginning after 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.030" offset="5879515">And it's saying that I suggest the second consequence and that is that we are dealing with the long term future, not with tomorrow, next week, even next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.050" offset="5927581">But we're dealing with 20-year contracts to be executed in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.003" offset="5951404">We're concerned with the structure of the market in the 1970s, 1980s, and beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.886" offset="5986931">And the third consequence is that it really doesn't make much difference but certainly it is not decisive whether a pipeline company is currently selling gas or has an existing pipeline into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.202" offset="6060178">As I say that, we submit, is clearly not decisive and I can best illustrate this by referring to the situation that has developed since the merger in the southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.756" offset="6118379">Today, there is intense rivalry between El Paso, Transwestern, and Gulf Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.570" offset="6153697">The El Paso and the two new companies I mentioned earlier, for the increment of demand expected after 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.179" offset="6188074">Transwestern is the only one who has any substantial unused capacity in its pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.172" offset="6212106">Gulf Pacific would build a new line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.864" offset="6222869">El Paso would have to build a new line or greatly add to it's -- the capacity of its existing facility but yet there's no question but that those three concerns are now competing for that next increment of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.289" offset="6288488">I don't want to exaggerate this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.915" offset="6299042">Obviously Algonquin that carries gas into Boston is not a competitive factor in the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.397" offset="6333001">The location of the company, its resources, its access to supply, its relation to the market are all do -- all are important in determining whether it's a competitive factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.569" offset="6389635">The only point I'm seeking to emphasize is that the fact there is no bridge from Pacific's line to California and that Pacific has never actually delivered any gas in California, does not show that it is not a competitive factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.522" offset="6453478">Now against that background, I come to the critical question, was Pacific such an independent competitive factor for future projects to the California market that its acquisition by El Paso may tend substantially to lessen competition?</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.617" offset="6541876">Here, we're concerned, I think, primarily with the structure of the market as the Court emphasized in Brown Shoe and in the Philadelphia Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.926" offset="6583045">The legislative history shows beyond the doubt of what Congress was concerned within Section 7 was barring chip -- was to nip in the bud monopoly and other restraints of competition by barring those changes in the structure of the market that generally result in a lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.799" offset="6674578">Taking this case then in its simplest terms what it seems to come down to is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.300" offset="6704567">The largest pipeline company in the country, the only actual supplier of gas to California has acquired the only other company which was a pipeline in being west of the Rockies and which was at the time of the acquisition seeking to enter the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.472" offset="6813236">Pacific was a going enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.674" offset="6826088">It was interested in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.177" offset="6836120">It tapped areas of production which would be increasingly important to California on the face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.756" offset="6870392">Swallowing up by El Paso, one of its few natural rivals would seem substantially to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.739" offset="6914278">Now, while those seem to be the essential elements, our case of course goes far beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.749" offset="6942386">First, the undisputed evidence shows, we think, that just prior to the merger, Pacific was engaged in active competition with El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.418" offset="6981047">And remember that Pacific's life was short so that even one instance of rivalry in this business would be very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.613" offset="7017827">Let me describe it in a little detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.508" offset="7037367">In 1955 and 1956, one of the major new increments of demand in Southern California was the need of Southern California Edison for a permanent supply of natural gas with which to fire its steam boilers for generating electricity in place of oil which was under much criticism as a matter of smog control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.252" offset="7160351">Up to that point, Edison had secured an interruptible supply from the Southern Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.178" offset="7188041">Interruptible because whenever the Southern Companies needed the gas to -- for domestic users or others, they'd take it away from Edison and Edison would have to convert it over to firing its boilers with oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.312" offset="7248645">The Southern Companies had been unwilling to commit a -- to make a commitment for furnishing Edison a steady supply for a long term for a block of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.395" offset="7308936">In January 1956, Edison which apparently felt this problem increasingly keenly went to Edi -- went to El Paso and as to El Paso, to make a direct sale of gas to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.669" offset="7366092">And El Paso refused to make the direct sale saying that, "You are a customer of our customer, the Southern Companies and therefore, we won't deal with you, go and speak to them."</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.626" offset="7417919">In May therefore, Edison turn to Pacific Northwest and they began to talk about a plan for bringing in 300 million cubic feet of gas daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.258" offset="7468387">In June, that's only a month later, either because they were cause in effect or by coincidence, and I cannot say which, the Southern Companies suddenly did offer a firm supply of 300 million cubic feet of gas to Edison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.371" offset="7536828">But that offer have to be withdrawn because Southern found that the gas wasn't available at the time Edison began to press the negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.082" offset="7579669">By July 30, Edison and Pacific Northwest had entered into a tentative agreement under which Edison -- under which Pacific would bring in from Canada 300 million cubic feet of gas daily which Edison would take 100 and up to 150 million cubic feet a days -- of gas daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.766" offset="7686457">Now this agreement was -- was tentative, necessarily so because you have to have some market for the whole 300 million in order to make it a financial -- financially feasible to build the pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.938" offset="7759078">But Edison and Pacific were pushing ahead with their plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.317" offset="7780603">Pacific was to deal with getting the supply and Edison was to approach the local distribution companies with a view to getting them to agree to take some of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.525" offset="7837445">PG&amp;E brushed it off very quickly but the Southern Companies expressed interest and asked for further details.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.867" offset="7878823">On August 24, let's just say it was about three weeks after the tentative agreement was signed, Kayser, the president of El Paso, went to call on Quentin who is the officer of Edison handling this promotion or deal or the transaction, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.368" offset="7964818">Kayser told Quentin that he wanted to hold the market there in Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.697" offset="7994180">In fact, in a memorandum, Quentin said that Kayser had said he was prepared to fight for the last -- to the last ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.103" offset="8019780">But Quentin testified that Kayser said, he wanted to hold the market there in Southern California and was prepared to supply it and that he would resist the efforts of anybody else, and he was referring to Pacific to come in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.050" offset="8079548">And then Kayser made an oral offer of a direct sale of 150 million cubic feet from El Paso to Edison with the Southern Companies to get a fee for transporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.941" offset="8159169">And my friend says in his brief that that statement is contrary to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.152" offset="8179963">But I think if you will look at the letter which Mr. Keyser thereafter wrote to Quentin, I won't take time to read it now but we refer to it in our brief that he describes how he had formerly refused to make a direct sale, how the Southern Companies have changed their policy and how he was now offering a direct sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.456" offset="8273168">So that it seems to me it's quite clear that he was aware of the competition and by inference that the rivalry brought about a change in Southern Companies' conduct and El Paso's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.443" offset="8341191">Now in the end, this proposal failed through because the Southern Companies decided that they could bring in gas more economically through what they called their existing pattern of supply, in other words, through El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.523" offset="8409422">But I submit that the failure cannot obscure either the fact of competition at that time or the likelihood that an independent Pacific would resume or continue this kind of effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.027" offset="8467519">Indeed, if one thinks suppose the acquisition had come on August 26 while the dickering was still going forward before the Southern Companies had said no, would seem to me no one would say that substantial competition, the chance of substantial competition haven't been less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.536" offset="8545468">Well, in terms of this market in the long term future, the dif -- the difference between an acquisition in October and an acquisition in August surely is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.188" offset="8596146">In addition, we submit that the undisputed facts show a probability that Edison's competitive activity wouldve continued and that we're not left simply to draw an inference from the instance that I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.829" offset="8662706">I've already mentioned California is insatiable market, growing at the rate of 200 million cubic feet a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.160" offset="8691963">It's quite apparent that the Canadian and Rocky Mountain supplies would in the long term future become more and more impartment to California as the gas -- Texas gas and the Permian Basin Gas was either used or committed to other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.970" offset="8771271">It seems inevitable that Pacific would have continued its effort to link them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.863" offset="8798856">There, it was hooked to both those fields very favorably located with only the need of a bridge in the California and with Pacific under the pressure of finding new markets because it's very badly needed new markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.141" offset="8867924">The opportunity, I think, is further approved by the fact that four major projects, while never completed, were seriously talked about in this short five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.722" offset="8922258">There was the agree -- there was a series of agreements that I mentioned earlier in 1954 and 1955 involving Westcoast Transmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.480" offset="8969279">There was the agreement with Edison that I just finished talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.178" offset="8988087">El Paso after it acquired Pacific Northwest had two projects that involved bringing down some Canadian gas that in one instance mixing it with very substantial quantities of other gas and so taking it to the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.765" offset="9058408">One of those -- one of run for Twin Falls, Idaho down to Las Vegas, the other was the Rock Springs project that we mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.013" offset="9099473">So there are four things that people seriously considered investing time and money and what I suggest is that they show that the likelihood of this kind of promotional activity was a reality.</text>
