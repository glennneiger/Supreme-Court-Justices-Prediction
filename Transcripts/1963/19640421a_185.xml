            <text syncTime="475.268" offset="2004407">And let's look to these contracts themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.275" offset="2012453">Now this to me is something I had great trouble with all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.114" offset="2031783">We have the insistence made here that there is an agency relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.146" offset="2047979">It's been made I might add ever since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.138" offset="2063966">That when we first commenced to assert any right, the taxes with respect to this contractors as soon as our Sales Tax Act was enacted in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.497" offset="2101373">The claim was instantly made that these contractors are agents of the United States Government and for that reason immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.518" offset="2141393">So, the thought was foremost in the mind of the AEC and -- and those representing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.753" offset="2170337">But over the course of the existence of this contract, it has been rewritten some 37 times at the outset of this litigation, 37 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.855" offset="2222791">The last rewrite is stated on the record testimony of their own witnesses was to reflect more accurately the operating relationship between AEC and its contractors, the 37th rewrite then was for that purpose alone according to their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.020" offset="2295411">Yet nowhere, nowhere in this voluminous documents, of these documents because we've got two contractors here, is there any phraseology whatsoever that would import agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.338" offset="2344730">Now, I realized and I wouldn't insist for a moment that labels are controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.864" offset="2366777">But it seems to me that whether that questions has been at issue for as long as it has here and they wanted to spell out that relationship and make it clear if in fact it was a relationship of agents that they would have said so in terms that anybody could've understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.115" offset="2427800">That is a point I simply can't get away from.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.853" offset="2438771">All they had to do is to write that contract and agency terms but they didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.914" offset="7511019">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.791" offset="7530559">First, may I simply say that there is no claim that Carbide or Ferguson is free of any other taxes on companies doing business in Tennessee, both are clearly doing business there under these activities with the Government regardless of their other -- they would be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.299" offset="7620524">Now this is a case where I think, it's very important to be precise in our use of words in all with it but there are too many slippery words here and I want to try and preserve the same meaning in hitting the high spots of the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.229" offset="7696280">First, we do not think that our case turns on the amount of control, the degree of control that the Government has over Carbide through Ferguson's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.958" offset="7755212">To say the same thing in other words, we think it is irrelevant whether Carbide is a servant or an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.305" offset="7804635">Our first contention is that the beneficial use of this property in the sense that it was that time was used in the City of Detroit and other Michigan cases is wholly that of the United States sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.094" offset="7879764">To put it as Mr. Justice Harlan suggested yesterday that all these activities in which the property is used are the activities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.008" offset="7927411">It's perfectly clear that everything that is done here is done with the property of the United States, at the risk of the United States and on behalf of the United State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.185" offset="7980074">And I would say that it was perfectly clear that Carbide is the agent, not the servant, but the agent of the United States because everything it does, it does for the account of the United States in all liabilities of those of the United States, nor profits of those of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.974" offset="8059277">It's just as if I inherited say a retail store and I hired a man or to go down and say, "Now, you run that store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.887" offset="8098879">Do everything in my name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.339" offset="8104730">I will supply all the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.964" offset="8111208">I will supply all the operating expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.685" offset="8126151">I'm not going to butt in with your running in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.487" offset="8133360">I don't know anything about the retail business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.798" offset="8142555">But that would be comparable to this and it would all be done for my account and use and benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.825" offset="8170663">So that seems to us that this case is clearly distinguishable from City of Detroit and the other cases which emphasized that the -- a man couldn't get an exemption in carrying on his business for his entrepreneurial profit, not for a fee but for his entrepreneurial profit merely because the United States had the technical title to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.742" offset="8274317">And I think that if these Tennessee cases that were mentioned here were examined, of course I'm speculating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.009" offset="8303365">One would find that those contractors like the contractor in King &amp; Boozer, have brought their equipment to the job as if they were in a sense entrepreneurs that they could profit or could lose and that they didn't simply received a salary for performing services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.975" offset="8375254">Then I come to the question which hasn't been decided except as it was decided in Livingston which we think clearly governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.179" offset="8412139">May Tennessee levitate tax as Mr. Justice Brennan put it earlier, on the privilege of rendering services measured by the volume of the property that you handle?</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.962" offset="8479222">In that sense, use handled in rendering the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.771" offset="8498448">Because I say use for beneficial use, this just handling, that's all these people do in this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.316" offset="8524675">And we say that this isn't that kind of tax, that this is a tax on the beneficial use, on the activities and the fellow who gains from it and that that is a tax on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.366" offset="8596877">Now, an effort was made to compare this case yesterday to SO -- Standard Oil Company case which you will recall was a tax on the privilege of storing gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.249" offset="8644420">But that wasn't privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.611" offset="8653824">That was measured by the volume of the gasoline's store and it didn't matter whose gasoline was stored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.038" offset="8683499">It was the gasoline of anybody including the Government that quite properly it was held to be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.843" offset="8710771">To make that case comparable to this one, one would have to suppose that a tax were levied on a privilege of storing gasoline of where we can't reach the buyer or the seller to collect the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.427" offset="8773047">And only, where one couldn't reach the buyer or seller to collect the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.834" offset="8798751">Well in that event, it really isn't on the privilege of the storing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.579" offset="8813693">It's an effort to substitute for the sales tax which is tax exempt or for the genuine use tax, which is tax exempt or if I can put this one other illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.685" offset="8870118">This seems to me to be comparable to saying that we're going to lay attack on the privilege of occupying property as the man, “As I occupy my office if the court occupies its chamber.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.194" offset="8920168">We're going to lay the tax and the privilege of occupying property but we will give credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.463" offset="8941275">We won't collect it at any case where somebody has paid a real estate tax on the ownership for the use of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.409" offset="8977011">Well again, that's simply comes down to an attempt to collect the real property tax from the fellow who happens to be there knowing that he will have to pass it under the tax exempt owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.817" offset="9038660">It's a tax on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.803" offset="9046601">Well now here, it's a tax on the use we submit by the United States that I think is a -- just the right case.</text>
