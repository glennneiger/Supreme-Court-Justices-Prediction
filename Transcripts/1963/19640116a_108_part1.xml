            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 108, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, Petitioner, versus Stiffel Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.717" offset="214288">Mr. Freeman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Will Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="30.075" offset="223692">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.541" offset="245530">I'm going to start with the issue in this case recognizing that this is a companion case to the one that immediately preceded me.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.630" offset="285863">The issue in this case is whether a federal court, following state law, can grant an injunction which amounts to the equivalent of a perpetual common law monopoly on what that very court has said is within the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.883" offset="386905">The facts are these, petitioner Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, and I'll refer to them as Sears, is a large retailing -- retail marketing organization with stores throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.715" offset="462242">It likewise sells by mail order through catalogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.575" offset="493693">Stiffel, respondent in this case, is a high grade manufacturer of lamps usually sold in what we might call the "better department stores", or through interior decorators.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.043" offset="563493">In 1956, Stiffel added to its merchandise line of table and floor lamps a pole lamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.981" offset="611244">Now, the name "pole lamp" suggests the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.860" offset="626813">A lamp which many of you may have seen extending between the floor and the ceiling with two, three or four conical shaped lamp fixtures fastened to the lamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.848" offset="694732">This is a called a "pole lamp."</text>
            <text syncTime="152.857" offset="714794">Sears watched the sale of pole lamps by Stiffel in this case and I can say this, that at about a time of the year before the trial of the case, Stiffel had some 25 competitors making pole lamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.310" offset="808626">Sears went into the business because they saw it was the type of business that the mass market -- it was a mass market product and that they could sell it to the mass market.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.120" offset="871842">Thereâ€™s no question in this case that what Sears, took a photograph or a -- an advertising cut of the respondent Stiffel and copied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.156" offset="923982">It made a pole lamp that was certainly similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.868" offset="954807">Sears contracted with an independent manufacturer, the Randolph Metal Company to make those lamps for Sears.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.845" offset="998797">Now, this all happened as I say, Stiffel came on the market in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.343" offset="1028786">In 1957, Stiffel came out with two United States patents, one a mechanical patent covering the mechanical construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.498" offset="1081344">The other, a design patent, covering eye appeal, as I call it, and it is the design patent that brings us here today, that is the subject matter, not the design itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.406" offset="1156995">Stiffel filed suit against Sears charging infringement of both the mechanical and the design patents, coupled along with the charge of infringement was the charge of unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.972" offset="1231287">The District Court ruled that the subject matter of both patents was clearly within the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.610" offset="1265768">This is not a case of functionality or any of that which I heard in the immediately preceding case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.007" offset="1299414">This is a case where the District Court found that the subject matter of the design patent, pole lamps extending between the floor and the ceiling, having a plurality of lamp sockets or fixtures mounted there on was clearly disclosed and within the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.027" offset="1395440">It was disclosed in some publications such as Quick Magazine which a magazine put out by the Loop People back about 1950 or 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.516" offset="1453432">It was likewise disclosed in other publications available to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.369" offset="1484884">Now, the District Court having found the Stiffel pole lamp lacking in the prerequisites essential of the grant of a valid constitutional and statutory patent monopoly for a limited period of time under the federal patent system proceeded to grant Stiffel a perpetual monopoly under the guise that it was following the Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.693" offset="1610167">And it gave Sears -- it gave to Stiffel this perpetual monopoly on the very subject matter which it said was in the public domain and free for everyone to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.728" offset="1678294">Now it's our position --</text>
            <text syncTime="397.877" offset="1694908">Thank you sir.</text>
