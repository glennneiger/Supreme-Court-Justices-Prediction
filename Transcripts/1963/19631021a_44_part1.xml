            <text syncTime="32.017" offset="231424">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.204" offset="248142">This case involves a suit for a refund of income taxes paid for the year 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.760" offset="278444">The only issue involved here is whether taxpayers filed a timely claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.230" offset="308328">Taxpayer's 1952 income tax return was filed in April of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.348" offset="340720">The tax shown thereon to due was paid by September of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.282" offset="364544">The claim for refund, on which this suit is based, was filed in June of 1958. Section 322 (b) (1) of the 1939 Code, which governs here, provides that to be timely, a claim for refund must be filed within three years of the date the return is filed or within two years of the date the tax is paid, whichever is later.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.299" offset="484603">Section 7422 (a) of the 1954 Code, which also governs here, provides that no suit for refund maybe brought unless a timely claim for refund has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.111" offset="551790">Hence at the outset, if the provisions of Section 322 (b) (1) are given their normal meaning and effect, this suit is clearly barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.086" offset="599751">However, taxpayers urge and the Court below held in this case that an enactment of Section 117 (q) of the 1939 Code on June 29, 1956, created by implication a new two-year period for filing claims for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.303" offset="692537">The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Sixth Circuits in the Tobin and Dempster cases held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.338" offset="736737">We believe the decision in this case below was erroneous for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.402" offset="769024">First, we don't think the decision is supportable on the basis of the language of the statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.042" offset="807581">Section 117 (q) provides that a transfer of all substantial rights to a patent shall be treated as the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months, regardless of the method of payment of royalties, pursuant to the license or transfer agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.186" offset="912071">That Section 117 (q) provides a substantive rule of law which was -- which then became a part of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.642" offset="949896">However, Section 117 (q) contains no reference to Section 322 or in fact to any other section of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.498" offset="1001409">Therefore, at the outset our view is that once Section 117 (q) is a part of the Code naturally it's to be construed in conjunction with and subject to the limitations of all other sections of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.726" offset="1074239">One such section is of course Section 322.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.399" offset="1097017">It's not the only one that might affect 117 (q), but at the outset we feel that the Court is faced with a proposition that there is really nothing it can construe, there is no language that suggests in anyway that 117 (q) is meant to modify 322.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.379" offset="1196910">In fact we believe this is the interpretation that Congress itself intends when it enacts retroactive tax legislation.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Mitchell Reese, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="351.549" offset="1509543">Yes I say it for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.474" offset="1517275">I think for example in Appendix C of our brief, we have set out approximately 47 retroactive measures enacted in the period 1953 to 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.086" offset="1567744">Now in 30 of those measures, Congress has specifically dealt with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.956" offset="1595225">Congress has specifically provided an extension of varying periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.070" offset="1619675">Sometimes it's six months from the date of enactment, sometimes it's a year from the date of enactment, in several cases it's 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.953" offset="1651231">There are a variety of solutions that Congress has adopted to solve this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.034" offset="1683519">I think if the theory of the Court below were correct, every one of those 30 measures would have been unnecessary because the theory of the Court below is that when Congress says nothing, if it makes the effective date applicable retroactively, it must intend to create a new two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.413" offset="1765021">Now in fact the result would be that in these 30 cases or at least in most of the 30 cases where Congress has specifically dealt with a problem and has specifically indicated at least in a number of them and it's -- that it intends to reopen or extend the limitations period, it would actually be shortening the period because if it said nothing, two years would be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.157" offset="1875989">So that by providing an example, an additional six months, it's actually reducing by a year-and-a-half, the period otherwise allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.496" offset="2217357">It applied to years normally barred on the date of enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.645" offset="2241912">On Page 22, we have quoted a portion of the both the house report and the senate report in which Congress said, this provision applies to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1946 to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.278" offset="2312443">However, the bill does not open up years with respect to which the statute of limitations has run.</text>

            <text syncTime="1102.464" offset="4513207">Now in Section 1235 of course, Congress did -- in enacting 1235 Congress was concerned as the legislative history shows with three problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.972" offset="4555212">One was the so called sale or exchange problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.725" offset="4570258">One was the definition of a capital asset problem that's the professional problem, and the third was the holding period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.341" offset="4608711">Now in enacting 1235, Congress said and the committee reports that we put in our brief accompanying 1235 showed that it meant to make all three changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.295" offset="4656567">However, when it enacted 117 (q), I think a fair reading of the legislative history shows Congress was concerned with only one of those three and the retroactive application was concerned with only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.687" offset="4710170">Now I would say this, the reasons I have given in terms of the legislative history of 117 (q) I think explain or at least help to explain why Congress didn't feel it was necessary to reopen barred years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.771" offset="4790418">I don't think our interpretation depends on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.626" offset="4801912">I think it's perfectly clear from first just from the face of the statute and second from the inference and explicit statements as to what Congress intends, but it did not intend to reopen barred years, that it did not intend the language it used to have that affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.189" offset="4896162">Now I think one thing that makes this absolutely certain is the comparison of Sections 1 and 2 of the act of June 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.244" offset="4944332">Section 1 added, Section 117 (q), to the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.468" offset="4969200">Section 2 added an amendment to Section 106 of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.810" offset="5002637">As they passed the Senate, both these provisions were retroactive, that is both applied to years normally barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.352" offset="5040776">Neither contained any reference to the operation of any other law or rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.185" offset="5068152">In conference, Section 2 was amended to add a provision which in substance states that if a refund pursuant to its terms is barred on the date of enactment not withstanding the operation of any other law or rule of law, well, let me be a little more accurate about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.911" offset="5154983">What it actually says is, Section 2 will apply notwithstanding the operation of any other law or rule of law if a claim for refund is filed within one year after the date of enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.652" offset="5209945">So in Section 2 Congress specifically dealt with the problem that's faced here, in Section one it said nothing, I don't see how any other inference is possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.363" offset="6316805">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.560" offset="6329657">The respondents would like to bring into focus the particular statutes that we have here and directly relate them to this case, because we feel that the chronology of the legislation involved is particularly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.756" offset="6398412">Prior to 1946, all pattern royalties paid on an exclusive license were taxed as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.094" offset="6435715">In 1946, the Tax Court decided the Myers case holding that where you had an exclusive license it could in fact be a sale, and if so if it were a capital asset the royalties that you received in the ensuing years would then be taxable as long-term capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.459" offset="6521187">The commissioner acquiesced in his opinion and published his acquiescence and so for a period of four years, these royalties were recognized as being long-term capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.452" offset="6581164">That was true as to the casual or amateur inventors, but of course it was not true as to professional inventors, because their patterns were considered to be their stock in trade, and they were selling that just like merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.181" offset="6644067">In 1950, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue reversed himself as to the amateurs and said that, from hereon in he was going to hold that all such pattern royalties were ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.525" offset="6701432">As counsel for the government has indicated the courts generally did not agree with his position and there was considerable litigation with the taxpayers generally winning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.483" offset="6749288">The next important step was the enactment of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 in which Congress enacted Section 1235 and I believe it's fair to say that this in general, injected or brought into the Code a whole new concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.021" offset="6827447">The statutory language referred to a transfer of all substantial rights to a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.296" offset="6856600">It didn't go into title or other previous test that had been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.917" offset="6879065">The result of this was to give taxpayers for 1954 and subsequent years' long-term capital gain on their royalties received under exclusive license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.243" offset="6936325">This applied as to professional inventors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.453" offset="6949177">It applied as to amateur inventors and even I think perhaps additional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.804" offset="6974568">It applied where the patent or the inventor had not held the pattern for the usual six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.532" offset="7005497">It eliminated the holding period requirement and two of these three tests were entirely new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.948" offset="7035173">Now despite the enactment of Section 1235 and despite the courts' decision giving taxpayers the capital gain treatment, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue published a ruling to the effect, that as for the four years, 1950 to 1954, he was going to continue to hold that these royalties were ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.686" offset="7150111">This was the situation when on June 29th, 1956, Congress enacted Section 117 (q), which is practically identical in language to Section 1235 and in doing so Congress said with regard to the applicability of the statute, this sub-section shall apply with respect to any amount received or payment made pursuant to transfer described in paragraph 1 in any taxable year beginning after May 31, 1950 regardless of the taxable year in which such transfer occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.978" offset="7315310">This gave professional inventors a right as to these four years which they had never had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.161" offset="7344044">It also gave taxpayers selling their patent a new right in that they did not need to pay any attention to whether they had held the patent for the six months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.977" offset="7391274">Now, against this legislative, judicial, and administrative background, I think should be considered the facts in the case of Mrs. Zacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.717" offset="7430248">In the first place, she held about 14 patents, at least at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.100" offset="7451773">The Court of Claims made no finding on whether she was a professional inventor or an amateur inventor, because first, the opinion which is being reviewed here was based on the pleadings, and secondly the case was disposed on the merits by an agreed settlement in which this issue was not stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.776" offset="7542471">We strongly contend that Mrs. Zacks was a professional inventor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.458" offset="7561174">This is not questioned in the government's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.101" offset="7575803">In fact its opening sentence says, the contention of the respondent are adequately dealt within our principle brief and then the government goes on to discuss some railroad legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.939" offset="7623137">So it seems to us that Mrs. Zacks should clearly be considered a professional inventor and as the Court has noted already under the decided cases she would I think be a professional inventor with this number of patents, I found no cases of anybody having 14 patents that was held to be an amateur if they were all in the same related field.</text>
