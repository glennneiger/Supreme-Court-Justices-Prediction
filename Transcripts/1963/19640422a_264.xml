            <label>Mr. James P. Donovan</label>
            <text syncTime="14.770" offset="162461">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.688" offset="186075">The case which we are about to argue has been variously described as a contempt case and in the Monday's Washington Post under the calendar, it was described as a runaway construction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.127" offset="239888">Actually, what we are here involved with is a question which I believe is of great importance federally because we are involved not so much with contempt but with the judicial power of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.871" offset="298820">Briefly, how this case arose, in April of 1961, a group of people, small people, little people who live in the neighborhood of Love Field, a municipal airport in the City of Dallas, Texas, retained counsel in an effort to stop the expansion of that field and the construction of a new runway for the purpose of carrying jet traffic over their homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.830" offset="410728">46 people were involved.We filed an action in the state court of Texas, the District Court, praying for an injunction against such construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.336" offset="460675">As grounds for that injunction, we offered the Texas Constitution and its prohibition against seizure or damage to property without compensation in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.209" offset="516159">In the course of the temporary hearing, we discovered that he was proposed to support this and finance this new runway by the issue of revenue bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.088" offset="559731">There had been no elections so we amended our pleading and included that as a ground, an additional ground for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.682" offset="586062">In other words, the issuance, proposed issuance of revenue bonds without having submitted the proposition to an election as required by Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.316" offset="624619">We had a motion for summary judgment which was granted against the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.839" offset="646771">We appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals which reviewed the case and rendered decisions supporting or sustaining the summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.074" offset="683656">We then applied for writ of error to a Texas Supreme Court which writ of error was denied, no reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.346" offset="716779">We consider that the in re portion of the Supreme Court decision is important because of the rule in Texas which states that where a decision, where the Court, the Supreme Court is in accord with the result of the case, whether it's not wholly satisfied that the Court of Civil Appeals has correctly declared the law, then it is a reversible refused, no reversible error decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.104" offset="827747">In other words, the result is right but the court of the -- the Supreme Court is not in agreement on all points of law mentioned in the opinion, which we believe is important in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.543" offset="1281546">The class is, perhaps, important because in the original suit, the class was described as "The homeowners, families and individuals who live, work, reside and attend schools, churches and other community centers in the area embraced with the approach areas of planned runway, 1331 (l).</text>
            <text syncTime="314.736" offset="1362317">Actually, the type of class is important because of the fact that it was not a taxpayer's action even though people that were involved in the suit were taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.823" offset="1410696">Now, then in the interim, the action was pretty fast in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.640" offset="1425951">The suit was filed April 3rd, summary judgment rendered July 16, 1961, certiorari denied by this Court in July of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.885" offset="1466911">And the motion for rehearing was denied in October 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.847" offset="1482794">In the Court of Civil Appeals' opinion, on the question of the injunction predicated on the proposed issue bonds the Court stated that we were not entitled to the injunction and that no election was required on those bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.087" offset="1547682">However, on examination of the authority cited by the Court of Civil Appeals established that the case has cited held that under the law of Texas, it was not possible to enjoin a proposed issue of bonds that the remedy available to the taxpayer and the citizen was to go in to Court after the bonds had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.682" offset="1634095">The rule says that the only way that you can attack it is to go in and seek to enjoin the payment of bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.722" offset="1666278">The idea behind the rule is stated in those cases that if a bond issue is void, then there is no damage to the taxpayer, therefore, an injunction of a proposed issue will not be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.651" offset="1721971">So in that situation reviewing the law and having learn the considerable amount about the operation and the interim between the beginning of the suit and the determination of the appeals, 30 of the original plaintiffs in the Atkinson case which was the first suit, joined by another 92 plaintiffs who were not in the first suit, brought an action in federal court which we refer to here as the Brown case.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.726" offset="1974314">Following that application, the city, which was the only defendant, moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.941" offset="2007124">The plaintiffs or petitioners then filed an amended complaint which was June 23rd, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.408" offset="2033037">And the amended complaint is the one that we were heard on and the judgment was granted on.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.948" offset="2059160">Now, then, in the federal action, we had not only some 90 new plaintiffs who were not involved in the original Atkinson state suit but we also had a new group of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.307" offset="2116629">We have the original defendant, the only common defendant to the Atkinson and Brown case, the City of Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.869" offset="2142856">We join the Attorney General of the State of Texas because of his obligation under law to certify to the legal issuance of bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.671" offset="2182040">We join the mayor, the city manager, the city auditor, treasurer, secretary and counsel of the City of Dallas because of their activities in connection with the issuance of bonds and a bond issue which was not in existence at the time of the institution of the original case.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.038" offset="2259571">We join -- join the bond house which was handling the distribution sale of these bonds and we join the bond attorneys upon whose advised these bonds were being offered to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.375" offset="7828877">Counsel has stated over here that the state law of Texas requires a referendum on the matter of issues or revenue bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.987" offset="7875271">I defer with that and the cases that I've cited to you here in our brief that in the revenue bond cases, under the Texas law and even on ad valorem taxation, there is no constitutional requirement whatsoever that that be a referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.484" offset="7949354">However, the legislation did provide that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.094" offset="8211728">With that, I disagree and I think those are in the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.340" offset="10300688">On appeal, the judgment was modified to the effect that the Court should not have pass upon the plea of res judicata but should have recognize the injunction issued by the Florida Supreme Court and dismiss the lawsuit on that ground and that was the judgment of the Circuit Court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.019" offset="10379473">The Court also say to the state that if the opinion or the judgment in the -- of the Florida Supreme Court were not satisfactory to this party, that he -- his remedy was to seek readdress in this Court by certiorari appeal which of the case maybe and not to -- to litigate elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.691" offset="10462124">Similarly in this case over here, when the Supreme Court of Texas order the Court of Civil Appeals to proceed with the enforcement of the judgment which it had rendered in the Atkinson case by one of our -- writs were necessary, it was then moved to ask the state -- of this Court, well, they didn't do it.</text>
