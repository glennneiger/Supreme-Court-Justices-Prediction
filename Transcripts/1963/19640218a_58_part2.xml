            <text syncTime="4.248" offset="120351">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.613" offset="129860">I would simply like to point out at this time where the milling-in-transit limitation occurs in the record so that you can take a look at it and its on page 212 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.746" offset="170402">And if you will look at that tariff publication about the middle of the page, there's an underscored portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.817" offset="230588">And it reads, "Rate applies only on corn and corn products when milled in transit."</text>
            <text syncTime="38.047" offset="255561">It's those four words, there milling -- that are the milling-in-transit limitation and that those are taken out of the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.447" offset="277191">As you will see, the rate applies both on corn and corn products.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.296" offset="296521">Now, that milling-in-transit limitation applied only to this part of the rate up to Kankakee.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.005" offset="323375">It doesn't have anything to do with the rate from Kankakee.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.350" offset="336750">Those rates are -- are published in a different tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.225" offset="348244">And if that limitation is taken out, the rates apply both on corn and corn products.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.992" offset="367365">Now, we put -- set forth in our brief why that affects Chicago merchants, and I'm not going into that question here because I simply don't have time to discuss that.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.670" offset="402056">But what is presented here then by that milling-in-transit limitation is a straight question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.384" offset="428910">Whether or not the Commission does have to consider and make findings on the discrimination against Chicago in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.569" offset="457644">Now, Section 4 of the Act gives the Commission the power to grant relief from the long- and short-haul clause in special cases after investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.241" offset="504351">This provision was in the original Act to regulate commerce in 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.940" offset="523160">Neither in the original Act nor in any subsequent amendment thereof has Congress ever set forth any affirmative criteria as to what constitutes a special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.325" offset="564642">Now, this Court said, and I'm quoting from page 18 in my brief in the Intermountain Rate Cases, one of the early cases dealing with the Commission's power to grant relief from the long- and short-haul clause, “that the Commission's power is made by the statute to depend upon the facts established and the judgment of that body in the exercise of a sound legal discretion as to whether the request should be granted compatibly with a due consideration of the private and public interests concerned and in view of the preference and discrimination clauses of the second and third sections.”</text>
            <text syncTime="152.019" offset="711450">Our argument is that the Commission cannot find that there is a special case which justifies relief from Section 4 if the rates which are proposed would violate Section 3 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.241" offset="764322">The Commission itself has held that in a long line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.347" offset="780727">We have collected in Appendix A to our brief 15 cases ranging from 1911 to 1960 in which the Commission has held that and in a couple of those cases, they've actually said they cannot find a special case if the rates would violate other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.646" offset="850004">Our case was the only aberration in that whole line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.507" offset="873409">And after they decided our case, they went back to the other -- went back to the historical position and then two weeks -- about two months ago, they went back to the position that they took in our case in the Seatrain case, the aftermath of the Seatrain case and that cited in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.034" offset="947493">But they've now made up their mind definitively, apparently that they're not going to consider Section 3 cases in -- in Section 4 investigation unless this Court tells them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.064" offset="987617">Now, if there were any doubt --</text>

            <text syncTime="231.478" offset="1029308">If there is any doubt about our interpretation of the Act being correct, that is settled by the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.677" offset="1058043">And the National Transportation Policy says that it's the policy of Congress to encourage the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges for transportation services without unjust discrimination, undue preferences or advantages or unfair or destructive competitive practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.493" offset="1129305">And the National Transportation Policy provides that all provisions of the Act shall be administered and enforced with a view to carrying out that declaration of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.617" offset="1173817">If there were any doubt about it, that determines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.468" offset="1185207">Now, I would like to speak for just a moment about two of the points which are raised by the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.594" offset="1209762">They say that the only material issues in a Section 4 case are whether the rates are compensatory and whether the competition is actual.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.722" offset="1254275">The statute does not read that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.899" offset="1262947">They are negative criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.128" offset="1271933">The Commission cannot grant relief if the rates are not compensatory and it cannot grant relief if the competition is not actual.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.673" offset="1318013">It is true that the Commission can grant relief if there is a compensatory rate and the competition is actual but that is not to say that they must not consider other things and in -- in our argument is that they must consider Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.460" offset="1385200">I have promised to leave time for the Solicitor General to argue the position of the United States so I will not be able to comment on the rest of my -- the rest of our comment upon the arguments made by the appellees but they are covered in our brief and in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.096" offset="1463777">And I asked this Court to require the Commission to make findings on that issue and to set aside the Commission's order and return the case to the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.123" offset="1535875">Mr. Goodman.</text>

          <turn speaker="frank_i_goodman" startTime="360.206" stopTime="752.840">
            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="360.206" offset="1544234">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.495" offset="1557400">While the United States is nominally an appellee in this action, we agree substantially with all of the contentions advanced by the appellants, Mechling and the Board of Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.813" offset="1602644">With the appellants, we believe that the District Court's judgment should be reversed, the Commission's order set aside and the cause remanded to the Commission for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.751" offset="1650395">In our view, the Commission urged in two principle respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.875" offset="1666905">First, in refusing to past upon the Board of Trade's contentions that the proposed rates, because of a milling-in-transit restriction, discriminated against Chicago Shippers of wholegrain and thereby violated Section 3 Paragraph 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.047" offset="1743600">And secondly, the Commission urged in that -- its conclusion that the proposed rate reduction did not constitute a destructive competitive practice and did not impair the barge lines inherent advantage as the low cost mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.299" offset="1812564">That -- that conclusion by the Commission was not supported either by adequate findings or by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.122" offset="1847881">Now, first, as to the Board of Trade's contention, Mr. Spencer has argued in his brief, and in the time available to him to some extent in his oral argument, that the Commission is under an absolute statutory duty to withhold its approval from rates under Section 4 which would violate other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.816" offset="1950595">While we do not disagree with Mr. Spencer's position, we don't think it necessary for the Court to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.095" offset="1979747">To us, the dispositive consideration is the fact that the Commission itself, whether or not it was bound to do so, is that an original statutory matter has consistently taken the position for more than 40 years, both before and after the present case, that it would not, and indeed under the statute, could not approve any application for 4 Section relief where the resulting rate would be unjust and unreasonable under Section 1 or would be unduly discriminatory under Sections 2 or 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.496" offset="2121331">Assuming that the Commission has some latitude now to depart from that policy or to make exceptions to it, nonetheless, we think it was foreclosed from doing so in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.102" offset="2175770">If the Commission was to depart from that policy, it could do so, we submit, only after giving the parties adequate notice in advance so that they could take steps to protect their interest at a time when its still might do them some good.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.332" offset="2236688">Now in this case, the rates were originally filed in December of 1956 under a misapprehension that no 4 Section relief was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.596" offset="2281723">Seven months later, in June of 1957, the application for 4 Section relief was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.510" offset="2309413">In July, the barge lines and the Board of Trade filed their protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.206" offset="2332191">And it was made crystal clear in that protest that the Board of Trade's contention rested upon Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.976" offset="2359254">No -- no objection was made at that time by the railroad that this contention was out of order or in anyway immaterial to the 4 Section proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.661" offset="2398020">The hearing before the Examiner commenced in January of 1958, now more than a year after the rates had been in effect, the very outset of the hearing, the Board of Trade, Board of Trade's counsel again made it clear that he would raise contentions under Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.524" offset="2473462">And during the course of the proceeding, evidence was introduced by the Board of Trade's counsel and witnesses which bore on the Section 3 issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.158" offset="2512018">At no point during this hearing, with any objection raised as to the materiality of that evidence by the railroads, the evidence was not excluded by the Examiner, the Examiner did not so much as intimate that this evidence was somehow not germane to the 4 Section proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.069" offset="2587669">The Examiner's opinion came down in March of 1959 that was now two and a half years after the rate originally went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.316" offset="2636675">And in the Examiner's proposed order, it was stated that the Section 3 issue raised by the Board of Trade was not directly germane to the 4 Section issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.127" offset="2687875">But in any event, there was no question to discuss those issues because he was finding -- he was finding the rate improper on strictly 4 Section ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.845" offset="2730715">Finally, in June of 1960, three and a half years after the rates went into effect, three years after the protest was filed, the Commission, in its opinion, stated that it would not consider these Section 3 objections because they were not directly relevant to the 4 Section proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.473" offset="2821308">At that point, the Commission told to Board of Trade what it should've told them in the first place, namely, that if they wanted these objections to be considered, they should go out and file a complain under Section 13 of the Act or ask for a commission investigation under Section 15 of the Act, three and a half years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.102" offset="2895809">And the Commission so notified the Board of Trade at the outset and if the Board of Trade had followed that procedure, it would almost certainly have had a simultaneous adjudication of all of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.659" offset="2938023">And if the Commission found merit in its position, the rate would almost certainly never have been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.816" offset="2962683">We don't think the Board of Trade should suffer as a result of the Commission's want of equity in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.779" offset="2990477">Now, there's still another reason, we think, why the Commission was bound to consider the Board of Trade's objection in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.151" offset="3015973">This was not an extraneous consideration, an extraneous issue to the 4 Section issues per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.460" offset="3049200">The fact is that, without considering the Board of Trade's contention, the Commission could reach no meaningful conclusion as to the degree of injury which was inflected upon the barge lines by this rate or as to whether the proposed rate was compensatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.282" offset="3288482">Well, briefly in two sentences, it's -- it's interrelated in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.581" offset="3305723">If the milling-in-transit restrictions were removed so that Chicago -- Chicago shippers of whole corn were free to use the 5.5-cent rate, which they now are not then presumably, a substantial amount of the corn which is now being shipped over the Belt way would -- would not stop in Kankakee the proper thing but would go via Kankakee to Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.875" offset="3414915">And from Chicago be reshipped to the east.</text>

            <text syncTime="865.936" offset="3567156">But in addition to that, it concluded also that the proposed rate change would increase the railroads' net revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.374" offset="3604877">And the reason for that is that, every carload of corn which is being brought over the Belt Line to Kankakee would be displacing another carload of corn, which prior to 1957, the Kankakee processor would've bought on the Chicago grain market.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.706" offset="3674154">After having reached Chicago either by barge or by some other railroad and which would then have been carried by the New York Central from Chicago to Kankakee at a rate which would later have been credited against the 49.5-cent reshipping rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.386" offset="3740923">Now, that means that under the prior practice, the railroad would realize no net revenue whatever from each Chicago to Kankakee operation over and above the 49.5-cent reshipping rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.622" offset="3793899">So the Commission says at the very least, the railroad is better off now to the extent of the 5.5 cents it gets for shipping that same corn over the Belt way -- Belt Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.369" offset="3840815">And in addition to that, it's also better off by another 2 cents because on the Chicago to Kankakee operation, the railroad incurred a 2-cent switching charge in the Chicago Railroad Yards which it does not incur in the Belt way operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.486" offset="4033285">And that is that the whole contention, the whole basic for the Commission's conclusion that the 5.5-cent rate would increase the railroad's net revenues was based on the assumption that the corn moving on the Belt Line would displace corn or otherwise it moved from Chicago to Kankakee.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.130" offset="4099845">And if the milling-in-transit restrictions were removed so that Chicago shippers could use that rate as well as Kankakee shippers, then presumably a substantial amount of the corn would be moving to Chicago and not to Kankakee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.542" offset="4153553">And those shipments to Chicago would be noncompensatory and non revenue increasing on any theory because -- first of all, they will involve additional out-of-pocket cost in addition to the 8.5 cents out-of-pocket cost to the Moronts or from the Belt Line to Kankakee trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.842" offset="4222725">And secondly, they would not be displacing even more unremunerative shipments that the railroad had been obliged to make prior to 1957 to Kankakee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.693" offset="4874115">I believe that's right, Mr. Justice Black, and it is certainly one of the principal reasons for the adoption of the National Transportation Act in 1920 which amended Section 4 in which put in at some of the provisions that are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.629" offset="4933883">Now, if I may just to address myself now to the question which was raised earlier by Mr. Justice White, and more recently by Mr. Justice Stewart about the Commission's conclusion that it's the whole 55-cent rate that has to be compensatory and not be 5.5-cent component of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.595" offset="4997726">Let's just suppose that the -- well, first of all, let me say that the authorities are all to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.182" offset="5016116">There are many Commission cases and there is one case by this Court, the Santa Fe case, all of which is cited on page 27 of the Mechling brief, which hold that the Commission must consider every separately published rate whether it's a proportional rate and it's part, let us say a part of a through rate or whether it's a separate flat rate at one time or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.612" offset="5101798">But beyond the authorities, let me point this out, this 55 -- this 55-cent through rate from origins to eastern destinations includes the 5.5-cent factor and the 49.5-cent factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.263" offset="5160417">The Commission could not lawfully reduce that 49.5-cent factor because that rate, the 49.5-cent reshipping rate from Kankakee or from Chicago to New York, continue to apply to all ex-barge corn arriving in Chicago or all corn carried to -- that is Chicago or Kankakee, and to all corn which was carried by any other rail carrier to Chicago and Kankakee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.062" offset="5263653">And it's well-settled under the decisions of this Court that the New York Central could not charge a lower reshipping rate for corn which was brought to the reshipping point by its own Belt Line, then it could for corn which was brought to the reshipping point by corn competing carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.353" offset="5324779">Well, that means that not less than 49.5 cents must be attributed to the eastern portion of the route and therefore not more than 5.5 cents must be attributed to the western part of the route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.666" offset="5378069">In other words, the 55-cent rate has to be not only above the railroad's fully distributed cost but it has to be at least as high as the sum of the 49.5-cent reshipping rate plus the out-of-pocket cost for the inbound proportional part of the route over the Belt Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.210" offset="5440240">Because if that's not true, then one of two things must be happening, either the railroad is charging a discriminatively low rate for the reshipping part or its charging an unremuneratively low rate for the inbound proportional part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.173" offset="5504084">Now, conceivably, if the railroad had been able to show in this case that by charging a 5.5-cent rate over the Belt Line, it was greatly increasing its traffic over the eastern part of the route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.173" offset="5548074">And if that eastern traffic was sufficiently profitable so that it generated additional revenues which would more than offset, the loss is incurred on the Belt Line, then conceivably, it might have avoided our contention about being a destructive competitive practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.786" offset="5606484">But there's no evidence of that, there's no finding of that and there's been no contention by the railroads that they increased their business over the eastern part of the route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.841" offset="5638771">In fact, the record clearly shows that the sole purpose of putting this rate reduction into effect and probably the sole effect of it was to increase traffic over the Belt Line portion of the rate -- of the route by diverting traffic from the barge lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.098" offset="5699793">And in no circumstances, we think it clear that the rate increases the revenues -- of the railroad's net revenues and its compensatory and is not a destructive competitive practice if but only if that additional traffic on the barge line pays its own way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.813" offset="7110614">For my portion of the time, I intended to discuss the rate situation as it occurred before the Commission, the procedure followed by the Commission and also the issues presented to the Commission by the 4 Section application and the reasons why the Commission did not rule on the alleged violations of other sections of the Act such as Section 3 (1) and 3 (4) in the 4 Section application proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.930" offset="7235062">Now, in the interest of clarifying our position, I desire to restate to the Court the rate situation as it developed before the Commission, both prior to the appearance of the Chicago Broad of Trade and Mechling Barge Line before the Commission and thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.512" offset="7313429">To begin with, let us go back to December 15, 1956.On that date, the New York Central made effect of a proportional rate of 5.5 cents, minimum 100,000 pounds on corn and corn products when milled in transit from 17 points in Illinois which are located on the Kankakee Belt Line to Kankakee over its line direct and restricted to apply on traffic destined to points in New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia and to points in New England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.750" offset="7478418">Now, this diagram illustrates the -- the points that we are concerned with are on Kankakee Belt Line which is this portion of the New York Central's Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.657" offset="7530036">The destinations were approximately here, all points East in New England and on the eastern seaboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.632" offset="7581863">Now, for the sake of definitions, I'd like to make this point a proportional rate is one restricted so as to the applicable only on traffic having prior or subsequent transportation and is only a portion of the total through transportation charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.924" offset="7659081">This proportional rate factor became effective in accordance with this 30-day statutory period of notice without any protests, objections or any representations, that the total transportation through charges resulting from the use of a new proportional rate created Section 4 long- and short-haul violations at the intermediate points or any other violations of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.715" offset="7770258">Now, on occasion, I may refer to violations of the long- and short-haul clause of the Section 4 as Section 4 departures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.814" offset="7810591">Now, when the December 15, 1956 rate adjustment was filed with the Commission, the New York Central did not apply for relief from the long and short-haul provisions of Section 4 because it was thought that existing 4 Section relief, which had been previously granted by the Commission in conjunction with the rail through rate via Chicago and Kankakee, was sufficient to cover any 4 Section departures which occurred as a result of the application of the 5.5-cent proportional rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.712" offset="7954265">The relief relied upon by the New York Central is applicable to the existing reshipping rate from Chicago to the East which was 54 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.506" offset="7997419">Now, if you will look at the diagram between pages 4 and 5 of the brief of the New York Central, it's the green brief, green cover, you can see that the reshipping rate from Chicago, you can see that the reshipping rate from Chicago to the East before December 15, 1956, that is before the competitive period, was 54 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.288" offset="8172544">This proportional reshipping rate was changed after December 15, 1956 to 59.5 cents as a result of general rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.265" offset="8224475">This proportional reshipping rate is applicable from Kankakee as well as Chicago and it was to be used in conjunction with the new 5.5-cent proportional rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2506.230" offset="10128280">No, there is a difference here and I should like to explain it as I go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.158" offset="10148028">Now, in order to give effects to the 5.5-cent proportional rate, the tariff contains provision which provided that the single factor rates from the origin points on the Kankakee Belt Line to final destination as well as the flat rate from Kankakee to final destination which will previously observed as the minimum rates were restricted so as not to apply when the combination of the proposed proportional rates to and from Kankakee to final destination is lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.172" offset="10284074">The effect of this restriction also enabled compliance with the aggregate of intermediate provisions of Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.698" offset="10314167">And this provision provide -- which is a facet of the long- and short-haul prohibitions of Section 4 declares that it is unlawful for rail carrier or water carrier which is subject to regulation by the Commission to charge any greater compensation as a through rate than the aggregate of intermediate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.746" offset="10394311">Now, however, it was subsequently discovered that by limiting the application of the combination proportional rates to the destination territory, as I have just noted in this area here, long- and short-haul violations were created at intermediate destination that is in this area here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.918" offset="10495039">And these were created in central territory and there are also at origin points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.122" offset="10515832">For an example, the first type of violation using Dwight, Illinois which is on the Kankakee Belt Line, about here, as a representative origin point and Philadelphia, as a representative more distant destination point and Akron, Ohio, as a representative intermediate destination in central territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.111" offset="10615829">On December 14th, 1956, the combination rate from Dwight to Akron, Ohio was composed of the rate factors, Dwight to Kankakee, Kankakee to Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.233" offset="10672253">And it's amounted to 54 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.340" offset="10684688">This compared to 65.5 cents Dwight to Kankakee, Kankakee to Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.332" offset="10708720">In other words, there were no 4 Section departures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.777" offset="10718438">The rate to Philadelphia was higher than the rates of the intermediate point of Akron, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.586" offset="10749680">After December 15, 1956, when the rate adjustment became effective, the rate from Dwight to Philadelphia became 56.5 cents which was 2 cents lower than the rate of 58.5 cents from Dwight to Akron so that the reversed situation occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.941" offset="10835153">Now, as an example of the origin departures, this can be illustrated by the following, from Moronts, Illinois to New York City, the combination rate was 59.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.055" offset="10887607">This compared to 72 cents from Kankakee which is the first higher rated intermediate point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.951" offset="10915192">In other words, the reduction occurs from here to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.978" offset="10935254">But as you begin going East from Kankakee, the higher rates begin to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.666" offset="10958033">And then 61 cents from Hamilton, Indiana, which is the last higher rated point about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.239" offset="10992306">Some of the origin 4 Section departures are simply tactical in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.755" offset="11018428">For example, the combination of proportional from Moronts, Illinois to New York is based upon 100,000-pound minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.188" offset="11052074">Whereas, the rate from Kankakee and Hamilton was based upon a 40,000-pound minimum thus, a shipper at the intermediate origin point would have to move at least 100,000 pounds in order to be eligible for a lower rate before he could complain of the higher charge at intermediate points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.339" offset="11136711">That should be noted that the departures at the intermediate origins are of the same nature as those previously authorized in connection with the reshipping rate from Chicago and Kankakee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.403" offset="11188955">Now, to alleviate the situation and to bring its rates into compliance with the 4 Section of New York Central for two steps, it published the tariff which broaden the destination territory to include points in central territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.712" offset="11254262">In other words, it extended westward the destination points which could be used -- which could use this rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.011" offset="11299401">Getting back to our example, the rate to Akron, Ohio from Dwight, Illinois was reduced to 44 cents whereas the rate to Philadelphia remained on the higher level at 56.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.343" offset="11352795">This eliminates violations from the long- and short-haul provision of Section 4 destinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.838" offset="11378709">This tariff was published to become effective originally on July 30th, 1957 and the effective date was postponed voluntarily until August 29th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.100" offset="11431790">Although the New York Central could have broaden the rate adjustment of August 29th, 1957 to eliminate the origin departures, it elected instead to maintain its revenues at the intermediate origin points because they were not subjected to barge competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.071" offset="11515695">Consequently, it filed an application on June 27th, 1957 in which it sought authority to continue the higher rates applicable from the intermediate origin points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.825" offset="11566686">That is between Kankakee and Hamilton, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.108" offset="11595839">It was at this time, more than six months after the 5.5-cent proportional rate became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.190" offset="11632097">And when the New York Central was attempting to bring its rates into compliance with the 4 Section that the appellants, Mechling Barge Line and the Chicago Board of Trade, first entered the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.807" offset="11686640">Now, they file protest against the 4 Section application urging that the relief be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.067" offset="11711613">In addition pursuant to the provisions of Section 15 (7) of the Act, they protested the rate adjustment scheduled to become effective August 29th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.113" offset="11759783">They contented that this rate revision resolved resulted in violations of Sections 1 and 3 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.415" offset="11785070">And they requested that the Commission invoked its discretionary authority under Section 15 (7) of the Act to suspend the rate revision for the seven months suspension period and to institute a general investigation for the lawfulness of the rates proposed to become effective August 29th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.618" offset="11873886">Now, in accordance with the Commission's long standing rate procedure, the matter of the 4 Section application and the pleadings filed in connection with the 4 Section applications were given initial consideration by the 4 Section board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.853" offset="11938774">The request for suspension and investigation were considered by the board of suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.341" offset="11960717">Both of these boards are composed of employees of the Commission who are authorized to take initial action on the rate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.060" offset="11995617">It should be noted that the proportional rate which became effective on December 15th, 1956 were not before the boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.136" offset="12039920">The December 15, 1956 adjustment could not be suspended because it had become effective by operation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.295" offset="12076596">The suspension board acted first on August 26th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.159" offset="12100002">And it decided not to institute an investigation and not to suspend the rate revision which was scheduled to become effective August 29, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.522" offset="12141484">The notice of the board of suspensions specifically stated that its action was not a final determination of the lawfulness of the rates but that they could be made subject to investigation by a formal complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.175" offset="12200103">The 4 Section board, after its investigation decided on August 27, 1957 to grant relief pending a hearing on the 4 Section application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.376" offset="12248900">These boards order also indicated that it -- that it did not approve any rates that may be filed under the order and that the rates could be made subject to complaint and investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.263" offset="12300413">Now, appeals were taken from the action of the boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.631" offset="12313893">And the Commission Division 2, acting as an appellate division on August 27th and 28th, 1957, upheld the actions of the boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.925" offset="12351091">The appellate division noted that its action did not constitute a final determination of the lawfulness of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.625" offset="12381915">The Commission's determination not to invoke its discretionary power to suspend the rates and not to institute a general rate investigation pursuant to Section 57 -- 15 (7) placed the appellants unnoticed that any further challenge regarding the general lawfulness of the rates would have to be initiated by the appellants by filing a formal complaint under Section 13 (1) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.288" offset="12492570">Of course, the appellants were aware of the provisions of Section 1.42 of the Commission's General Rules of Practice which applies to initial rate proceedings under Section 15 (7).</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.421" offset="12545024">This rule specifically provides that no protest shall include a prayer that it is also be considered a formal complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.146" offset="12579924">Should a protested desire to proceed further against the tariff which is not suspended, a separate later formal complaint should be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.311" offset="12616600">Now, it is apparent that the pleadings filed by the appellants before the Commission attacking the rates scheduled to become effective August 29th, 1957 were insufficient to want the Commission exercising its discretionary authority to suspend those rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.018" offset="12687444">Significantly, if the Commission had exceeded to the appellants' request for suspension, it would have resulted in the continuation of Section 4 destination violations which the August 29th, 1957 rate revision was intended to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.692" offset="12766124">Also, the refusal to grant any 4 Section relief pending a hearing would have prevented the maintenance of origin departures which were similar to those previously authorized by the Commission over the rail routes from Chicago and Kankakee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.558" offset="12837595">Thus, when the Commission set the 4 Section application down for hearing, the issue to be determined was whether the New York Central should be authorized to continue to maintain over its direct routes to the East, higher rates at the intermediate points between Kankakee, Illinois and Hamilton, Indiana and the lower rates from points on the Kankakee Belt Line such as Dwight, Illinois to destination points in the East.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.301" offset="12960580">Now, getting to the 4 Section proceedings, in 4 Section proceedings generally, the principal burden resting upon the applicant carrier is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.342" offset="13008750">First to show that the lower through rate to the more distant point is reasonably compensatory and secondly, to justify the charging of a lower rate at the more distant point than the corresponding rates at the higher rated intermediate points such --</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.098" offset="13103731">Now, such justification must be based upon transportation standard as distinguished from industrial or trade practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.888" offset="13138944">That is to say that the justification for the variation in the rates or rate levels which result in violations of Section 4 between the more distant and intermediate points must be based upon a dissimilarity of material transportation circumstances and conditions surrounding the respective movements such as carrier or market competition at a more distant point and the absence of such competition at the higher rated intermediate stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.871" offset="13266840">Stated in other way, such a showing is necessary to establish a special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.062" offset="13291604">Now, it is true that the Commission will not grant 4 Section relief when the through rates authorized at either the more distant or intermediate points violates any other section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.581" offset="13349700">And such a situation may arise whether or not the complaining point or shipping interest is located on the route which relief is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.571" offset="13397661">The matter to be emphasized is that the alleged rate damage must be caused by the through rate authorized at either the lower rated -- to lower rated more distant stations or the higher rated intermediate stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.613" offset="13461817">In actual practice, the rates involved in a 4 Section case may be and they frequently are combination through rates composed of individual rate factors covering different segments of the through hauls to the more distant or higher rated intermediate point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.744" offset="13530363">Such individual rate factors embraced in the combination through rate may be lack rates which have separate or independent application on a shipment moving between the points covered by such a rate factor or proportional rates as in this case, which have no independent application and consequently may be used only in constructing the through rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.028" offset="13631509">When as in the present situation, the through rates involved in the 4 Section departures are combination rates, whether composed of flat or proportional rates, no burden rest upon the applicants to justify the individual rate factors embraced in the through combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.259" offset="13712384">Consequently, the problems in such a situation center around the lawfulness of the through combination rates within the meaning of the prohibition in Section 4 (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.572" offset="13761703">And additionally, any claim of unlawfulness under any other section of the Act that would result from the application of the through rates for which relief from Section 4 sought, both the Chicago shipper protest under Section 3 (1) and the Mechling protest under Section 3 (4) and the allegation of unfair destructive competitive practices are directed primarily, if not entirely, against only one rate factor embraced in the through rates considered in the 4 Section case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.942" offset="13915094">And as previously explained, no burden whatever, rested upon the applicant carriers to justify a single factor embraced in the considered combination through rates for which relief was granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="4419.823" offset="17782680">May it please the Chief Justice and this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.711" offset="17794173">I represent the New York Central Railroad Company, the appellant in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.473" offset="17817266">In the argument and in the briefs, the Mechling Barge Lines asserts that our rates are lower than necessary to meet competition and they raised the question that the Commission carried in so finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.627" offset="17873899">This question is one of the two principal questions presented under the 4 Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.158" offset="17903992">Mr. Justice Black suggested that this question of whether or not the rates are lower than necessary to compete was a pivotal question and I agree with you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.798" offset="17942549">The competitive issue raised by Mechling can fairly be characterized as having dominated the hearing before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.379" offset="17972851">With the appellant Mechling and others suggesting that the rates should be as much as 13 cents, 100 pounds higher than our present rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.957" offset="18007228">35 witnesses testified at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.763" offset="18018408">31 of which testified in respect to the competitive issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.557" offset="18033560">And with this emphasis placed on the case, it's not surprising that a major portion of the Commission's report here deals with the competitive aspect of the case and deals with the subsidiary findings and discussion of facts that led to the Commission's ultimate conclusion that the rates are not lower than necessary to meet the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.787" offset="18126555">The line of the New York Central, west of Kankakee, and the barge line in the Illinois River serve a common territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.649" offset="18161977">This area is one, which insofar as deserved by the New York Central, is an area that we can only handle corn or grain out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.975" offset="18199280">The Commission made a finding that our principal business at those stations is grain, preponderantly corn, that's at record 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.463" offset="18233240">Now, while this origin territory is reached by and served by both the barge lines and the railroad, there was no competition between the two routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.442" offset="18273155">The all-rail route from Moronts, for example, to the East via Kankakee versus the barge rail route to Chicago and then East by rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.505" offset="18321429">The Commission did find that at one time, all of the corn move via the all-rail route but with the development of the Illinois River, the corn left the rails and move via this barge route.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.876" offset="18366882">Mr. Spencer referred to a figure of 270 carloads of corn as having moved in 1956 and 45 carloads of corn has -- is having moved in 57.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.511" offset="18421426">The record doesn't explain the unusual figure for 1956 but it was the 1955 previous are record -- are of record and the movement was less than a hundred carloads during the entire year from those 17 stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.737" offset="18498330">When the all-rail routes lost the business to the barge lines, the small businesses along the New York Central on this line from Kankakee to Moronts were affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.058" offset="18539604">The Commission found that they ceased the commercial elevation of corn and were relegated to the milling of corn -- elevation of corn from milling and resale locally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.018" offset="18591431">There's testimony to support that from country elevator operators who are located and have their businesses along the line of the New York Central which has testified in our support.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.478" offset="18637302">It was to correct this situation and to put some business back in our railroad, to put our small business people into -- back into business that we published these rates, and I might mention that the record also shows that our business situation down there was so serious that we gave consideration to abandonment of a portion of that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.868" offset="18738866">Again, referring to this important issue before the Commission, the Commission's ultimate finding that the rates are no lower than necessary to meet competition is based on three different types of proofs to that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.054" offset="18795604">First of these is the effect of the rates in the movement of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.685" offset="18810128">As these rates were in effect before the year prior to the Commission hearing, the Commission had evidence based on the traffic experience under the actual competitive conditions created by these rates, which Mechling contends are so low its to be distractive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.001" offset="18891421">On that -- fortunately and admittedly, the 1957 corn crop was a good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.105" offset="18919842">The barge business increased in Chicago to an excess of 34 million tons in total into approximately 27 million tons -- excuse me, bushels, from these ten competitive ports to Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.331" offset="18984730">The rail movement from these 17 stations between Moronts and Kankakee in total was 5,362,000 bushels on which more than 20% or more than a million bushels moved for export on rates that were five to seven cents lower than those that are a sale is being destructive and non-compensatory.</text>
