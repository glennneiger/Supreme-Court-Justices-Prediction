            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">J. I. Case Company et al., versus Carl H. Borak, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.233" offset="136338">Mr. Davis, you may continue with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_s_davis" startTime="11.674" stopTime="615.661">
            <label>Mr. Walter S. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="11.674" offset="150026">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.419" offset="157027">As we closed yesterday afternoon, the question had arisen as to whether we've -- had attempted as our opposing counsel has suggested to sneak a question in on this petition for the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.104" offset="227767">I would refer to the -- the Corporate -- petitioner's reply brief, pages 10 through 15 which I reread last night.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.023" offset="267473">I think it is a complete answer to the assertion and I -- I subscribed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.687" offset="302164">As I proceed with my argument and get to the statement of the question presented here, I think it will become obvious why the applicability of the state statute pertaining to security for expenses is inextricably entwined in the question that is before the Court on this grant of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.403" offset="408952">Now, as I had said yesterday, Count 1 of the complaint is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.362" offset="436851">Count 2, which our trial court, the District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.497" offset="473318">Count 2 was held by the trial court to sufficiently state a federal question for the purpose of obtaining a declaratory judgment as to the validity of proxies.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.687" offset="530160">Our trial court held that the reference to Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act was sufficient to give it jurisdiction to give if requested a declaratory relief pertaining to the proxies that were solicited for the stockholders' meeting authorizing the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.219" offset="640293">With respect to the balance of the claim of Count 2 and -- and here is the important distinction with respect to the claim for rescission and damages, our trial court said that that did not lie within federal law, that that claim was essentially a state claim, a claim for a common law, de -- derivative type relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.929" offset="755127">And accordingly, since it was a state case of the state security for expense statute applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.525" offset="793475">Upon the respondent's appeal to the Seventh Circuit, as I mentioned yesterday, they reversed the holding of Count 1 and that is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.954" offset="831195">But as to Count 2, the Circuit Court for the Seventh Circuit held that the claimed violation of Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act was sufficient to make the cause of action uniquely grounded in the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.073" offset="911653">The Court further held that Howard versus First, a decision in the Second Circuit was wrong.The opinion cites Howard versus First, as being contrary to its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.275" offset="980511">The Seventh Circuit also held that Dann versus Studebaker Corporation in the Sixth Circuit was unnecessarily limited and would not be the rule in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.732" offset="1042265">And accordingly, upon our petition, the -- this Court granted the writ for certiorari to review the question as stated in the petition whether Section 27 of the Act grants a federal cause of action for rescission or damages to a corporate stockholder in respect of a consummated merger which was authorized pursuant to the use of a proxy statement, alleged to have contained misleading statements violative of Section 14 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.711" offset="1182177">I would like to make about three points to the Court if I may before I turn this (Inaudible) over to Mr. Whyte who is representing the corporate petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.436" offset="1225122">First of all, we would start with what we believe is a general agreement among all party here -- all parties here.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.549" offset="1277576">The petitioners, corporate and individual, are of the view that Count 2 of this complaint states a derivative cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.925" offset="1319058">That is an action that is brought in the right of the corporation, that it's really the corporation's cause of action that the corporation is not enforcing, so a stockholder has appointed himself as champion of the stockholders and is bringing it for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.349" offset="1396799">The Securities Exchange Commission, amicus before this Court at pages 16 and 17 of their brief, I believe agree with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.612" offset="1441834">Where at the top of page 17 of their brief, they state, "We do not dispute the characterization of the action as derivative at least insofar as it seeks damages and rescission."</text>
            <text syncTime="347.202" offset="1492198">And that certainly is in accord with our view of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.381" offset="1516857">The respondent, Carl Borak, the stockholder, has not conceived that it is derivative except for the purposes of extended argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.132" offset="1559907">I certainly not going to accuse counsel of having a -- reached an agreement with us but I think it is significant that counsel recognizes that this is an important point and an important feature of the entire case because they very readily assumed and admit that Count 2 maybe derivative for the purposes of extended argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.947" offset="1671189">Now, our position is this, that if Count 2 is derivative then under the rule of Howard versus First, we must look to the statutory history of the Securities Exchange Act and determine whether the Securities Exchange Act is intended to create any substantive rights in a corporate issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.062" offset="1775574">The Second Circuit in going through this, processed -- found there was no such legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.332" offset="1804727">In fact, the legislative history was to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.930" offset="1827088">The general statement as to the purpose of this legislation is that as far as proxy solicitation is concerned, the purpose is to bring about the broad public need for full disclosure and as the Second Circuit related in its opinion, this is a not a right -- a substantive right in the corporate issuer who ordinarily issues the proxy statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.151" offset="1956028">And that the Securities Exchange Act was to protect investors and not the corporate issuers.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.655" offset="1989987">Other cases, the Brout (ph) case which we have cited goes -- traces much of the same history and reaches, in general, the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.320" offset="2040665">Now, this being the case, the Second Circuit, finding no legislative history to support a right in the corporation, held that in a derivative action, a federal cause of action was not stated by the mere reference to Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.812" offset="2134601">And we submit that this decision of Howard versus First is well reasoned, it's consistent and logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.051" offset="2175561">We have also cited a case called Lapchak versus Sisto, Judge Dimock in the District Court in New York in which he, to our way of mind, succinctly states the situation with respect to proxy solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.925" offset="2255078">In this Lapchak case, we had a fact situation very similar to the one in the case at bar, where there was a claim that director's had -- have profited by a sale of assets of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.665" offset="2314010">Judge Dimock states it very succinctly this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.837" offset="2334699">He says, "If the proxy statement which is alleged to be bad under Section 14 (a) of the Act were followed by a fair exchange, the directors would not be liable to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.735" offset="2390288">Also, it is perfectly clear that had the proxy statement been perfectly lawful but followed by an unfair exchange, the directors would be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.595" offset="2429785">Since liability, asserted by plaintiffs and maybe approved without regard to the proxy statements and cannot be proved without regard to the alleged breach of fiduciary duty, it is impossible to say that the plaintiffs are asserting a right under or created by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.200" offset="2504182">We believe the logic and the consistency of that statement is irrefutable.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.676" offset="2526124">In -- in fact, we don't believe that opposing counsel has sufficiently distinguished the case or made a real comment on it.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="615.661" offset="2566040">So supposed a vice and proxy statement has its failure to make a -- a full and fair disclosure of what the exchange is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.709" offset="2602193">And I suppose if the proxy statement did make a full and complete and fair disclosure of whatever the merger was going to be, even though the conditions of the merger in the opinion of some stockholders would be unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.652" offset="2661961">There would be nothing wrong with proxy statement if it fully describe with what the -- those conditions were going to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.497" offset="2701354">Well, what he is saying is that where you -- where you've come to Court and ask for broad retrospective relief like rescission and damages, that the reference to a violation of Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act is not the nexus of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.545" offset="2781602">That really what you are seeking when you're bringing a derivative action is a -- a common law claim for breach of fiduciary duty and that is what's --</text>

            <text syncTime="686.026" offset="2847431">There are all kinds of other provisions in the Securities Exchange Act which cover penalties and regulation of people that issue bad proxy statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.615" offset="2893824">But the point is that the -- that proxy statement and the solicitation of proxies is only a collateral function in the whole of merger -- corporate merger process.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.055" offset="2943561">If all of the stockholders came to the corporate meeting, of course you -- you wouldn't have the -- any problem with proxy solicitation but you still have the question as to whether the directors discharge their fiduciary duty and made a honest transaction and that is the point that the -- the proxy statement is -- is not within the main thrust of the complaint and therefore --</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter S. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="757.574" offset="3133628">Exactly, as Judge Dimock said.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.886" offset="3142928">The proxy statement may be good, the bargain proposed may be so grossly inadequate as to constitute constructive fraud but if the proxy statement is good, you still have the cause of action of whether the directors breached their fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.881" offset="3222862">And that the one does not make the other one moot and that is our contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.830" offset="3250657">Now secondly, the Seventh Circuit held with respect to Count 2 that if the stockholder plaintiff sought a vindication of the -- the federal right to full disclosure which plainly the Act requires, that he could have such.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.516" offset="3329442">In fact, this respondent here asks for declaratory judgment as to whether the proxies meet or do not meet the standards of Section 14 (a) of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.496" offset="3385344">But in accordance with Dann versus Studebaker which was the case applied to this situation by our trial court that would be all that the stockholder would be entitled to because that is the only right that the federal law creates, is the duty of full disclosure and the right that the investor be form -- informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.296" offset="3488580">Now, I would like to just make one addition point.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.570" offset="3509687">We believe that the Howard versus First decision and Dann versus Studebaker, are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.889" offset="3546885">That is we, the individual petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.116" offset="3563813">We say they're logical and consistent and they do not create a lot of damage and strained construction of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.455" offset="3605191">I would also point out to this Court that being logical isn't the whole answer, that there is a question of what are the policy considerations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.986" offset="3647300">And we would point out that there is no reason why the Court should not feel free to allow the state statute for security, for expenses to be applied here because in the Securities Exchange Act itself, under the -- under Sections 9 (e), Section 18 (a), both of which creates specific causes of action, security is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.501" offset="3765373">The Court is given the power and discretion to fix security as a condition for a person bringing an action thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.764" offset="3798392">And accordingly, we don't believe that there is any overriding policy which would militate against, having the state security for expense statute applied here on the common law phase of Count 2 claiming the breach of fiduciary duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.344" offset="3876760">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.783" offset="3970487">I suppose it's not a unusual or -- or original remark to say that this case is of considerable importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.903" offset="3999013">As I conceive it, it does -- may have far reaching effects as to the extent to which rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission are -- will replace the corporation law of the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.958" offset="4083231">Over the years, the question of corporation law has been left substantially entirely to this -- to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.930" offset="4123042">I can recall I think to -- a few times from the last 15 years where there had been proposals in Congress to have a federal corporation law and I don't think it ever got out of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.462" offset="4173197">Congress believed corporation law in general should stay with the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.745" offset="4194304">The state laws spell out the basic organization of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.211" offset="4220217">It base -- it spells out how you could get your stock subscription, the incorporators, how you in -- amend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.727" offset="4246235">How you amend the certificates, how you elect directors, how you hold corporate meetings and how you -- that you indemnify for instance at the present time most of them, the directors against suits that -- where they are sued unjustly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.219" offset="4316244">And the merger laws are spelled out very carefully in the state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.672" offset="4346023">This merger was under the law of New York, under the law of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.092" offset="4367757">There was -- surviving corporation was Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.209" offset="4380191">To merge, you had to comply with both of the laws for the American Tractor Company on the one hand and the surviving company, the J. I. Case Company whom I represent, on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.580" offset="4425644">And it was all -- it's all spelled out in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.505" offset="4437347">Now, to what degree is state law to be test out and pushed aside for federal law brought in by implication and not with specific act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.840" offset="4502758">It's pretty much the basic question we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.072" offset="4515610">Now, in the merger laws over the years, I checked up the other day and my young man reported to me that in 48 states, there is an appraisal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.561" offset="4561586">That is if you're not satisfied in 48 of the 50, if you're not satisfied with your stockholder, with the merger as it went through, you can file a proceeding in your state court, in the place where the merger went through, the state where the merger was completed, and ask to have your stock appraised as of the day before the merger and afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.323" offset="4656671">And if the merger hasn't flipped out to your advantage according to the determination of the judge in that very simple lawsuit, you can take your stock and hand it to the company and they have to give you the price that the judge determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.170" offset="4712051">It's simple, it's efficacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.795" offset="4722604">I've never heard anyone say it was unfair or cumbersome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.826" offset="4738696">48 states have enacted it and they've done it for two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.682" offset="4754056">One, they give the stockholder a very easy quick remedy if he doesn't like this merger which may involve thousands and thousands of other stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.214" offset="4792195">He can get a clean cut remedy on this basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.950" offset="4807137">The other one is, it prevents strike suits because if a man doesn't use that efficacious remedy, what right has he got in to come in later and say, "I want to upset the whole merger because I don't like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.557" offset="4853635">I claim this was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.698" offset="4858128">I claim that was wrong."</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.197" offset="4864188">If he doesn't use his simple way of giving his money back, 48 of 50 states have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.041" offset="4887489">About half the states, I think, have put in provisions for undertaking for expenses, not quite but pretty nearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.586" offset="4929703">And that's an efficacious remedy that -- and it -- an intentional thing that the states have setup to prevent strike cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.062" offset="4959587">They don't want every individual stockholder coming in and suing to have the merger -- J. I. Case, I think they had 8500 stockholders when this transaction took place and now has 15,000 or 20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.949" offset="5019146">Nobody -- to prevent them coming in with strike cases, they put in this supervision for undertaking for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.907" offset="5047045">If you're attempting to upset the whole corporate structure, you should give some protection to the defending corporation and its stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.204" offset="5092185">Now, should there be a national policy subordinating and throwing out all of these things that had been put in by the state, in order that by implication -- now, let's spend a moment or two, I think the implication that they've asked for here is pretty flinching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.238" offset="5172328">In the appendix of our main brief for the J. I. Case Company on page 1 of the appendix, we set out the various statutes and I want to refer to a few of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.192" offset="5216110">Section 9 has a provision of the Securities and Exchange Act that if there is a manipulation of security prices to -- by false purchases and sales on the market and so forth, a person who is injured can sue but provided he puts up an undertaking for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.173" offset="5296044">Also, provided that he can get, if he hurt someone, he gets judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.065" offset="5319659">That man can get contribution from others who were related with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.317" offset="5332616">They give him contribution as to defense or partial help to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.831" offset="5350693">And number three, they put in the statute of limitations to protect the man who's being sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.216" offset="5372217">One year from the time of knowledge, three years complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.426" offset="5389040">So that's the federal law on the manipulation of security prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.216" offset="5408266">Then on -- let me spend one moment on Section 16, the use and abuse of confidential information by officers, directors, stockholders who own more than 10% of the stock and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.413" offset="5461034">Anyone injured by unfair use of this information is given by the statute a specific federal remedy and it runs in favor of the issuer only, and -- but to protect the defendant, a statute limitations are put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.022" offset="5531460">Two years in this case only, not longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.002" offset="5547342">The other -- the other was one in three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.193" offset="5560195">Section 18, is a very elaborately drawn statute imposing liability for making misleading statements in registration statements and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.160" offset="5612022">Now, that gives the defendant there a number of defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.613" offset="5633860">Number one, the person sued has a defense if he can prove he acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.078" offset="5655698">That's in the federal statute where they provided the special remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.127" offset="5671894">Number two, the plaintiff asked to put up an undertaking for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.575" offset="5689657">Number three, the defendant liable -- who was made liable can recover contribution, and number four there's a statute of limitations again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.151" offset="5728005">One year from the time of finding out, three years in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.834" offset="5754755">Now, that's what the Congress put in when you have special remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.120" offset="5775862">Now, we're in a situation with Section 14 and they say, "Let's imply special remedies here."</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.868" offset="5806895">Section 14 hasn't -- gives no remedy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.695" offset="5822151">It states in essence that it's unlawful for any person to solicit a proxy for securities register in an -- on a national exchange in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.319" offset="5912639">On pages 18 to 28 of the appendix, I've -- we've copied the proxy rules that they have, the Commission has thus far prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.406" offset="5961017">Those proxy rules now take 20 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.020" offset="5971466">I understand 10 years ago, there were about 10 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.926" offset="5987035">I have no doubt that 20 years from now, there will be 50 pages if they expand as the normal progression of our -- the world develops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.859" offset="6030817">And you'll notice that isn't just contravention of proxy rules relating to fraud or amounting to something vicious or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.388" offset="6068955">Its violation of any proxy rule that they may make hereafter is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.743" offset="6094346">Now, the basic contention of the plaintiff here is that that language gives him a personal lawsuit in the federal court to upset any merger if he can claim a violation of any proxy rule at all and it can be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.951" offset="6163205">Under Section 29 of the Act, there's a very sweeping language that he wants to bring in with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.639" offset="6185880">It says under -- in Section 29, that any contract made in violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation made thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.417" offset="6225063">It really goes all the way, is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.110" offset="6235826">So he says, by ipso facto if there is something wrong about the proxy anywhere at all, then the merger agreement is void and then under the plain language of Section 29, the whole mergers is void, and let's start over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.656" offset="6294026">I think that's going pretty far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.192" offset="6304162">Now, I want to suggest why Congress didn't put a remedy in for Section 14, and it is that just because it's too broad to let the Securities and Exchange Commission spell out page after page, 50 pages of rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.696" offset="6386186">We'll say, with hundreds -- with a 100 do's and 50 don'ts or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.417" offset="6404995">And every one of those, if you're violating the law and in every one under Section 29, an individual can come in later and say, "Never mind the state law on a claim there's a violation of the proxy rules and let's set the -- let's set the merger aside and start all over."</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.484" offset="6549295">The idea is, as I gather, and as Professor Lowe (ph) said so and I realized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.758" offset="6570402">Let's leave it all to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.247" offset="6576358">The District Courts will handle this just rightly, they'll do it beautifully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.212" offset="6592240">Now, our first question when we get to the District Court is, the violation of the proxy rule, they probably claim as you omitted something that was -- that made something else misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.290" offset="6636544">Now, every proxy I've had -- every proxy statement I've ever had anything to do with, you of course put in the history of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.159" offset="6671966">And it's the easiest thing in the world with hindsight to say you omitted something in the history of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.279" offset="6704462">Certainly, it's not obvious to the trial judge when we get there whether there was something misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.461" offset="6733197">It's a question in context of economic and financial facts whether the thing omitted was material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.870" offset="6762872">You have to put in, in your good proxy statement, of course, a statement about your competition, where you are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.416" offset="6793070">And isn't -- the one that be the easiest thing in the world to say while you left out an important thing, you're an electrical company and you left out this very important new passage of General Electric had been announced to have taken or something of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.621" offset="6845837">You left something out and that's going to be the first issue of trial with experts on both sides in the federal court, was there something misleading omitted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.198" offset="6884185">And it's to be tried by an individual who claims he represents stockholders and the whole thing maybe greatly to the financial detriment of the company that's doing the best it can to keep operating and to confront -- confront the world as it is in the financial situation that it's in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.957" offset="6959208">And he's going to take the burden on and then when we get to the lawsuit, then we're really going to have a real triumph because they say, let's readjust the securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.270" offset="7000482">That's what the Solicitor General brief says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.679" offset="7010095">That's the Security and Exchange Commission says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.518" offset="7021484">And they really make to my mind, one of the most remarkable statements that I would almost brand as naïve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.700" offset="7050219">And I wonder if I'm making it too strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.391" offset="7064952">In page 27, he says -- the Solicitor General, this SEC brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.761" offset="7086373">They say, "After all, there's very little difference between delaying, by the Security and Exchange Commission, a corporate stockholders' meeting and requiring a new republication."</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.455" offset="7145200">This is subordinated in the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.017" offset="7151470">They say there's very little difference in that and readjusting the securities of the whole thing afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.357" offset="7176756">There's no difference between delaying a stockholders' meeting and in opening up, he says, in principle, the merger years later, and having it all rechecked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.456" offset="7221164">Well, I think there is a -- that it's a good deal, like saying there's little difference in principle between a parking fine and capital punishment by boiling an oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.196" offset="7256168">I can't conceive of things that are more different than reopening these mergers year after the -- a few years after they have taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.326" offset="7292635">But let's say we get in this case to a reopening of the merger at the instance of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.312" offset="7316668">We're going to then have battles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.426" offset="7325027">We're going to have, number one, experts on both sides, and the first question the Court is going to -- could be confronted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.193" offset="7360136">How should the merger have been properly done if there hadn't been this omission of some important material fact or something which in the light of hindsight now seems quite important? How will we -- how should it have been done of January, in our case 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.731" offset="7426278">And we're going to marshal experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.646" offset="7433906">And those experts have to be financial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.139" offset="7443937">They have to be economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.816" offset="7450624">They have to know all about the industry certainly and the plaintiff will have his row of experts and the company will have ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.104" offset="7483747">And the Court will have to decide what would've been a good merger in January, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.065" offset="7507675">What it would seem to me that would be unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.393" offset="7516975">That's only (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.216" offset="7524185">There'd been and let's say this comes on in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.097" offset="7535783">Now, he's got eight or nine years have gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.634" offset="7545919">Then this -- the District Court -- the Eastern District of Wisconsin will then probably say, "While we must also take into account the economic changes since."</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.031" offset="7587506">And so I guess, you bring in an economist and experts on the question since and say, "Now, what should we do to make this merger a nice merger now, because a lot of time has gone over the dam."</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.830" offset="7634735">Then I don't want to be too fictitious about it but then the Court should be realistic enough to say, "Well if I do put in a decree in June, 1965, readjusting this merger like I think now after all this expert advise, it should have been done eight years ago."</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.809" offset="7702653">Then I must be realistic to know it won't go into effect for a year or two because they're going to be appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.131" offset="7727940">And I should project the future economic and financial situation of this company in order to have to a realistic decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.183" offset="7760123">And perhaps the financial world will be much obliged for the judges' opinion on what's going to happen but I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.558" offset="7785618">Anyhow to me, it seems a farfetched affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.210" offset="7804217">In our reply brief and I don't want to take much more time now on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.599" offset="7829817">In our reply brief on page 6, we have -- I wrote out longhand the other day as an intellectual exercise, what I conceive the amendment they're asking the Court to make to Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.771" offset="7902438">The amendment that they asked to have put in by a -- an implication as Section 14 (c) (d) and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.954" offset="7931173">Section 14 (c), this is what they want the Court to decide by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.125" offset="7951862">And that is, any stockholder who alleges, that's all he has to do, within a merger proceeding involving his company, a proxy was used in contravention of the rules and regulation of the Commission as provided in the above, shall be entitled to bring an action under Section 27 of this Title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.319" offset="8028662">In such action, provisions of state law, such as the requirements for securities for cause, statutes of limitation or appraisal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.903" offset="8067009">Even though part of the state merger law in which the merger was -- under which the merger was consummated shall not apply to a plaintiff, nor shall the Court require a security for cause to be posted by any plaintiff unless expressly provided for by federal statute here and after enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.926" offset="8131062">I think that's exactly what they're asking this Court to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.214" offset="8144227">Then, this is what their whole asking, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.113" offset="8155826">If after a trial, the Court shall find that any proxies were utilized, pursuant to a proxy statement which was in any respect in violation of the rules and regulations specified above, such as by omission whether intentional or inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.497" offset="8221341">Certainly, they're not going to conceive to us that good faith is a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.072" offset="8239626">State of material fact then such proxies shall be declared void as is provided in Section 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.671" offset="8266062">And the agreement for merger and the merger consummated thereby shall likewise be declared void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.964" offset="8291244">All he's got to show, there was a mistake inadvertent or not, that somebody now is convinced with the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.068" offset="8315695">Next, in the event of such finding as set forth in the above, the Court shall be empowered after due hearing to award money damages against the corporations concerned, its defendant directors or other defendant persons payable to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.116" offset="8371806">And to such other member of his class as the Court may attach and shall impose cost as the Court may deem equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.494" offset="8397302">Next, the Court may also there require the corporation to issue a new or additional security -- that's -- asked for by the SEC here to the plaintiff and to members of his class as the Court may deem just.And in general, now I'm quoting, "The Court may make such other readjustments of the terms of the merger as the Court may determine to be just and equitable."</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.900" offset="8495000">Now, as they say, when we get through with all that and it's reopened and this is before the trial judge in Milwaukee, perhaps who was not in that -- he passed then to familiar in the financial field, he's going wrestle with the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.536" offset="8553514">I think that if the SEC wants amendments like that, but they shouldn't ask the Court to put it in by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.915" offset="8594996">They should go to Congress and say, "Let's have an amendment that will throw out securities for cost or throw out the appraisal business, throw out all these things that the state court have setup, all the remedies that they put in and let's give everybody a free ride to do it and we'll have a great cluster of strike cases but we think that's good."</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.235" offset="8676289">Personally, I think it's bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.756" offset="8686425">I don't think to make strike cases easy and let everybody attack every merger and there will be an attack I would predict if the Court does it by implication on every merger that comes through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.843" offset="8730728">Strike cases are something like homosexuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.320" offset="8740655">Ordinarily you're not supposed to refer to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.064" offset="8751626">But there are growing vice now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.997" offset="8759359">We have three in our office now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.167" offset="8768031">If we -- so that everybody come in and attack every merger that's claiming there was something of series omitted in the proxy statement of a material nature and he's got full scope of a free attack on mergers, where are we going to be with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.867" offset="8830830">Are we going to get to a point where we can't have a merger completed and put away without having some kind of a -- developing some kind of an in rem proceeding like you have an action acquired title about real estates?</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.713" offset="8882239">Do we have to wait for the state court here state statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.027" offset="8895509">We have six years of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.574" offset="8905644">In the state statute in Wisconsin on some things for fraud, is there a federal statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.691" offset="8934170">I would like to hear and I'm going to listen attentively what is the statute of limitations they are asking the Court to write in here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.452" offset="8969174">Which one is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.281" offset="8972518">Is it federal?</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.959" offset="8975235">Is it state?</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.673" offset="8978056">If we're going to write the state, well then why don't we read it in the rest of the state law or is it all out?</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.368" offset="8996864">Is there no statute of limitations to attack mergers?</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.352" offset="9012746">It seems to me that I would suggest if the SEC wants the law modified in this elaborate way, they should take it to Congress but I would also suggest not to be over optimistic that the Congressional Committee would go that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.470" offset="9109295">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.804" offset="9126640">The sole issue and properly before this Court is the scope of relief which a federal court may grant an action brought under Section 27 of the Securities and Exchange Act for violations of Section 14 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.970" offset="9207202">Counsel yesterday referred to the fact that the facts in this case was set forth in the complaint and for purposes of this appeal should be assumed to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.790" offset="9254536">However, those facts were not given to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.746" offset="9266343">It seems to me that the issues before this Court should be considered in the context to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.269" offset="9300407">As counsel has stated, the original complaint here have two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.789" offset="9314513">The first count is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.389" offset="9324962">No appeal haven't been taken from the Court of Appeals reversing the District Court as to that count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.251" offset="9352338">As to Count 2, Count 2 incorporates a substantial part of Count 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.583" offset="9377729">Briefly, the facts which come out from the complaint as a whole, the plaintiff here owns and has held for many years some 2000 shares of a common stock of the Case Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.180" offset="9432064">The action was brought on behalf of the shareholders of Case similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.450" offset="9461217">It was brought to vindicate the preemptive rights of those shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.398" offset="9484936">The jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship and -- and also on federal question jurisdiction both under Sections 1331 and 1337 of Judicial Code, as well as on -- on Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.135" offset="9567901">The facts are that on October 15th of 1956, the petitioners solicited proxies of Case stockholders for use at a stockholders' meeting to be held in November 15th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.801" offset="9630595">At which time an oath was to be taken on proposed merger with the American Tractor Company which I'll hereafter refer to as ATC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.294" offset="9668524">The proxy solicitation material was false and misleading in a material way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.673" offset="9698095">It was in violation of Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 1489 thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.065" offset="9731636">The merger was approved by small margin of votes and Wisconsin made it shortly thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.582" offset="9757654">The merger would not have been approved but for the materially false and misleading statements or omissions in the proxy solicitation material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.386" offset="9796942">I'm just going to discuss a few of the false and misleading aspects in this proxy material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.971" offset="9827244">The first relates to the manner of manipulation of the price -- market pricings of American Tractor Company stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.788" offset="9866533">The stock market price of ATC was used to their basis for justifying the exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.042" offset="9895581">This market price was -- was the result of manipulation in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and regulations issued thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.462" offset="9937272">Manipulation goes back to 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.367" offset="9952841">It began with the acquisition of a block of 170,000 shares of ATC stock at 51 cents a share by Edward L. Eliot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.903" offset="9994951">He was the defendant in this case who died on the course of the proceedings and for whom his executor has been substituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.594" offset="10021700">Eliot bypassed the registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.242" offset="10044374">He made a misleading offering circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.908" offset="10062973">He filed a misleading offering a circular with the Commission, and sold all, as a matter of fact, sold all his shares even prior to the filing or approval of that circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.996" offset="10111352">With a small amount of stock in the hands of the public, trading was relatively light, prices changed narrowly under -- changed rather fluctuated widely on narrow trading with the aid of stock splits, with the aid of special manipulative tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.236" offset="10188361">The stock rose to a high of $15 even though at all times, ATC was in very bad financial condition, never paid any dividends, and during most of the years of its business, suffered losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.309" offset="10260564">Now, the negotiators on both sides of this transaction, both for Case and for ATC, who were named as defendants in this case, knew prior to the merger that the market price of ATC was achieved both illegally and artificially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.372" offset="10324825">Since the merger, there's been a conviction on the plea of guilty by the New York broker for unlawful manipulation of ATC stock during the period from May, 1955 to February, 1956 which was almost a year prior to the merger in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.942" offset="10399117">The Securities Exchange Commission in a preliminary report for the -- made with relation to the American Stock Exchange was filed recently in January of 1962, noted that Gilligan, Will &amp; Company, a specialist in the American Stock Exchange for the ATC common stock, acquired the stock prior to the listing of ATC stock on the exchange and otherwise, engaged in various other improper and illegal activities with respect to ATC stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.051" offset="10527535">Eliot, during the course of his deposition, admitted that he knew there had been manipulation of ATC stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.637" offset="10561912">Eliot, and this is in the record, was also a close friend and an associate of members of the firm of Gilligan, Will &amp; Company, so much for the manipulative aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.746" offset="10606320">Secondly, I come to self dealing and this self dealing is very carefully concealed in this -- in this proxy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.930" offset="10643101">This self dealing included first of all the promotion of a merger by the management group in order to perpetuate themselves in office by shifting the voting control of the case to certain defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.834" offset="10694719">Second, the promotion of a plan --</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.394" offset="10864933">The second aspect of self dealing was a promotion of a plan by certain defendants in order to obtain a market for their large holdings of American Tractor Company's stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.918" offset="10915088">This was accomplished by obtaining the full current stock market price of AT stock -- ATC stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.601" offset="10949778">The third was the securing of valuable stock options for several of the defendants as one, the terms of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.121" offset="10983842">And finally, the securing by one of the negotiators for Case and the chairman of the Committee who was responsible for the actual making of the transaction of a substantial amount of business for his own company, a supplier of Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.427" offset="11069106">Third aspect of this proxy statement which is significant and which was not revealed was the excessive price which was paid for Case, grossly excessive price, a sum of $70 million for a company with assets of worth approximately a million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.208" offset="11168162">Case gave an exchange for each share of ATC stock, a half share of Case common and one share of $7, 6.5% preferred stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.908" offset="11214973">On the basis of this exchange -- of this price, the price paid was 218 times the average earnings for ATC during the years 1952 and 192 -- 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.999" offset="11275368">It was more than 50 times the -- the earnings for the best year of ATC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.579" offset="11305671">The book value of -- of Case was $36 a share at the time where ATC was $1 and 15 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.303" offset="11344541">You had a ratio here of 17:1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.657" offset="11365961">Finally, the proxy statement failed to disclose the capital requirements and the competitive factors which were involved in entering the road building and heavy construction business which was one of the prime justifications offered by the management for the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.026" offset="11447463">These factors were in important way responsible for the serious financial problems which later confronted Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.728" offset="11486333">By December of 1961, its indebtedness had increased to $162 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.374" offset="11520920">At a series of years of very severe losses and were it not for the agreement of a group of banks to extend this indebtedness and increased it substantially, Case would have been in bankruptcy or reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.697" offset="11578180">At the time of the merger, there was $42 million in the treasury of Case Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.202" offset="11600227">By the end of the fiscal year 1961, they had all been virtually used up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.171" offset="11868035">I think that the defendants here have -- petitioners have wavered considerably in deciding what the issue was and what relief they believe the federal court could give.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.260" offset="11912443">The District Court held that there was an implied cause of action under Section 14 (a) that limited relief to declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.853" offset="11954761">In fact that it -- it said the week that the plaintiffs could not -- could get a -- were -- could -- could obtain of the facts warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.796" offset="11990601">A declaration that the proxy statement was false and misleading, that the proxies were illegally employed and that the merger and the agreements made pursuant thereto were void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.470" offset="12045249">In the Court of Appeals, the petitioners and -- and I might say that the petitioners rep -- were represented by the same counsel in this case all the way through until after the grant of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.044" offset="12091538">And for the first time, Case Corporation had separate counsel after the petition for a cert -- certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.745" offset="12126333">In the Court of Appeals, the petitioners asked for an affirmance of the District Court order and argued that relief be limited to declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.164" offset="12171995">In the petition for certiorari, they stated the issues at -- as I see it solely in terms of the scope of relief and in part, they relied on the conflict between the Dann case in the Sixth Circuit and the Court of Appeals decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.608" offset="12241795">Now, in the Case -- in the briefs filed in this Court, in the first brief filed by Case Company, Case claimed that relief was limited to the relief -- relief that could be given was limited to injunction departing from the District Court ruling, the declaratory relief could also be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.389" offset="12344926">Nevertheless, the brief concludes with a request, the District Court order be reinstated to give declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.722" offset="12386304">Individual briefs similarly state the issue as though only the scope of relief is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.015" offset="12411382">Now, in the reply brief when -- when the -- for the -- only one reply brief was filed and this was for the Company and in oral argument, as I understand Mr. Whyte's argument, Case Company in fact reverses itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.114" offset="12483793">And without having taken a cross appeal from the District Court's judgment, asked this Court to reverse that this -- not only the Court of Appeals but also the District Court because it asked in its conclusion that all of Count 2 be stricken in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.184" offset="12556100">I might say that that position of course is -- at variance with the position expressed by Mr. Davis speaking for the individual petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.767" offset="12586402">He acknowledged that he believed that there wasn't implied cause of action under Section 14 (a) but that relief should be limited to declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.706" offset="12638229">As I understand the Company's position now, it is that there is no remedy under Section 27 for violations of Section 14 (a) and that Count 2 should be stricken in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.878" offset="12698833">I might say that the reply brief does not discuss or answer the cases cited by the respondent and the Commission in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.371" offset="12736867">I submit that the change of position of the Case Company was due to the realization that once the implied remedy -- the existence of the implied remedy has conceded, there is no sound basis for drawing a line as to relief given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.787" offset="12810533">The relief must rest on the discretion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.467" offset="12825266">It does not -- there's no issue of jurisdiction involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.416" offset="12845014">Now, in taking the position that the Case Company now takes and of course it has departed from the question presented in the petition for a certiorari and also it -- it's confronted with the rule that no cross appeal having been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.741" offset="12914291">It may not ask for a modification of the District Court order which is more favorable to it or less favorable to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.442" offset="12953161">This rule was stated by Mr. Justice Cardozo, very succinctly in the Morley Construction Company case which he says, "The rule isn't better and uncertain in the absence of cross appeal, appellee may not attack a decree with a view of enlarging his own rights thereunder or lessening the rights of his adversary."</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.072" offset="13051695">Now, we'll put these questions aside and meet the issue framed by the petitioners head on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.887" offset="13078967">Petitioners make in the reply brief two arguments to which I should make brief reference for the purpose only of indicating the full scope of the petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.749" offset="13122330">The first is that the -- the application of the expressio unius principles since it -- as it -- that the argument being and since there are three sections in which there are expressed remedies hence it follows that there cannot be any implied remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.673" offset="13182098">The second is the claim that Section 27 of the Act is a limited and not a general ground of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.391" offset="13212923">I might say in passing that the expressio unius argument was rejected by this Court in this -- the Securities Act of 1933 and the SEC versus C. M. Joiner Leasing Corporation case which is discussed at our brief at page 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.319" offset="13280632">And this Court construed Section 22 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 which is almost identical in wording to Section 27 as a general ground of jurisdiction in the Deckert case to which we refer at page 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.032" offset="13355551">The arguments -- these two arguments of the petitioner would also compel the conclusion that no remedy is created under Section 27 for violation of other sections of the Act including Sections 10 (b), the -- the antifraud section, Section 6 (b) requiring stock exchanges to adapt disciplinary procedures, Section 7, margin requirement provisions, Section 29 (b) which authorizes the voiding of contracts in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.680" offset="13474043">And moreover, it would prevent the Securities Exchange Commission itself from seeking relief under Section 27 which was not specifically provided for in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.548" offset="13521586">In effect, what this Court is being asked by the petitioner Case to do, is to overturn a substantial body of law developed over 20 years recognizing and implementing implied remedies under Securities Exchange Act, important part of the Federal Securities Regulation of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.522" offset="13605491">Actions have been implied on behalf of the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.602" offset="13625762">Under Section 27 for violations of various provisions of the Act by the Courts of Appeal from the Sixth Circuits then rejected by none insofar as shareholders are concerned, the Howard versus First case being a case involved in the derivative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.106" offset="13699845">In many of those cases, certiorari was applied for and denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.008" offset="13723355">And many -- many of those cases have been cited by this Court in other -- in context of other statutes where the question of implied remedies have -- have come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.377" offset="13772884">Now, so far as Section 14 (a) is concerned, the actions have been implied by the Sixth and Seventh Court -- Courts of Appeal and as to derivative actions by the Third Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.201" offset="13820217">As to violations of Section 10 (b), there had been decisions by the Second, Third, Fifth, and Sixth, and Ninth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.054" offset="13851564">As to violations of Section 6 (b), 7 (c), and 29 (b), remedies of an implied both by the Federal Courts of Appeal and District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.414" offset="13897017">And remedies have been implied for the Securities Exchange Commission itself under Section 14 (a) for violations of the -- under -- under Section 27 for violation of Section 14 (a) to the Third and Ninth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.945" offset="13963160">Now, this well-established body of law is grounded on sound analysis with the Securities Exchange Act and upon principles long articulated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.702" offset="14006209">The general rule which has been articulated by this Court many times is that where you have a statute which is designed to protect a class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.366" offset="14056887">And one of that class of persons is injured, the right of such person to sue to remedy the -- that injury will be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.147" offset="14104012">This was the basic of the holding and the Steel and Transtar cases, and in numerous other cases which this Court is familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.021" offset="14139434">Now, in this particular case, dealing as we do with the Securities Exchange Act, we have language in that Act which buttresses this special principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.466" offset="14181230">This is a remedial statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.192" offset="14192097">The Act itself, Section 2, declares and I'm quoting, "Transactions and securities as commonly conducted upon Securities Exchanges and over the counter markets are affected with the national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulation and control of such transactions and the practices and matters related thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.220" offset="14284257">And Section 2 also declares and this is important, that one of its purposes is to make, "Regulation and control of security transactions reasonably complete and effective."</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.518" offset="14345488">Now, under a broadly based regulatory statute such as a Securities Exchange Act, there are many reasons for implying a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.224" offset="14392299">This includes the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.523" offset="14405465">First, the fact that the Act and particularly the proxy that provisions are designed to protect shareholders and publicly held corporations as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.653" offset="14453948">The remedial purpose of Section 14 (a) was referred to in the -- in the legislative history as being to control the conditions under which proxies maybe solicited, prevent the recurrence of abuses which frustrated the voting rights of shareholders."</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.169" offset="14532002">As stated in a -- I think one of the most definitive decisions discussing Section 10 (b) in this case by Mr. -- by Chief Judge Biggs of the Second Circuit, the case of McClure versus Borne Chemical Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.371" offset="14600861">The Act creates a new federal law of management stockholder relationships and provides stockholders with a potent weapon for enforcement of many fiduciary duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.946" offset="14651120">In that case, I might say incidentally that the Court held that the State security for statute -- for expense statute was inapplicable to an action brought under Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.125" offset="14711829">The second reason for implying the cause of action as well as providing complete relief is the essential need for private actions when the task of securing compliance is of great magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.556" offset="14773582">The private action secures additional compliance and its existence also acts as a deterrent to noncompliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.104" offset="14807751">As the Commission brief points out, in this case, with relation to the matter of manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.239" offset="14832306">The Commission would not have been -- it would not have been possible for the Commission in the short time that it had to examine this proxy statement, to determine whether or not that price of ATC stock had been artificially maintained -- legally maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.661" offset="14905971">The third reason for implying the remedy is the need -- the need exists where the regulation creates new duties which are unknown or rare in the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.437" offset="14953096">Now, I might say in passing that with reference to the point made by Mr. Whyte, there are very few states that have statutes of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.194" offset="15000116">For the fact that public utility the -- that corporate transactions are interstate in character, requires you to form remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.051" offset="15043584">You -- in -- in most of these cases, you have numerous individuals involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.669" offset="15062079">They reside in various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.065" offset="15071587">There is need for clear provisions as to venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.892" offset="15094888">There is need for securing service over them which would be impossible if these matters were relegated to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.010" offset="15139401">There also, it's the practical problems which we point out in much greater detail in our brief and I refer the Court to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.933" offset="15171062">Finally there's -- these various -- the absence of any formal administrative procedure under the Act for shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.992" offset="15199378">There's no way in which shareholders maybe heard with relation to the violation of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.882" offset="15238875">In addition to these facts, you -- you -- we do have a recognition by Congress of the implied remedy with relation to Section 29 (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.564" offset="15277641">That Act was amended in 1938 and Congress, by the amendment, excluded certain contracts from being considered void in actions brought under Section 29 (a) recognizing that actions could be brought under that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.421" offset="15349008">And I might say that the lower court here held that it did have jurisdiction to declare these contracts invalid under Section 29 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.045" offset="15391535">There should be out of the consideration that the -- that the Commission itself, the agency which is charged with the administration of the Act should not be denied remedies essential to its task, a result which would follow the arguments of the Case Corporation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.572" offset="15469693">The reports, for example, have it -- to request the Commission appointed receivers of the 1934 Act or this particular form of relief is not expressed and provided for in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.523" offset="15517445">Now, all of the considerations which I haven't -- had listed which compelled the implication of a private right of action, also sustained the Court of Appeals holding that jurisdiction extends to grant whatever relief the merits of the controversy may require and requires a rejection of the -- it's better, a piecemeal litigation approach which was -- which was the approach of the Dann case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.389" offset="15644923">Any -- in fact except for Dann, no court has ever -- do not have the right to -- a plaintiff to appropriate relief has never been denied by any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.946" offset="15695182">There's never been any question raised as to the scope of relief except for that one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.237" offset="15728306">I submit that the Court of Appeals holding is sourly based under broad grant of jurisdiction in Section 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.676" offset="15754115">I won't' take time to read that Section, I think the cursory reading will indicate its breath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.545" offset="15781595">I think the Court's holding is -- is based certainly on use -- I'm -- I'm referring to Bell versus Hood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.869" offset="15818898">I think is on the sound ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.751" offset="15826422">In that case the Court stated, "That's been the rule from the beginning."</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.947" offset="15843140">There were federally protected rights have been invaded, courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4241.857" offset="17070791">May I -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.730" offset="17090330">The Commission believes that the existence of an effective private remedy for violation of the proxy rules is important to the congressional purpose of making proxy regulation reasonably complete and effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.694" offset="17150098">We here have only the question of whether there is federal jurisdiction to grant adequate rel -- relief and not as to what relief should be granted in the particular case or even whether plaintiff has pleaded the case or will be able to prove one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.539" offset="17225540">It has been said that the proxy rules are the most effective disclosure device in the SEC scheme of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.906" offset="17258977">On the other hand, they are among the more difficult to enforce because of the volume of worked, there are 2000 or so every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.616" offset="17293876">They usually have to be cleared in 10 days and the sanctions available to the Commission under the statute are somewhat limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.321" offset="17324701">There are no administrative sanctions, only injunctive actions and criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.183" offset="17352077">The problem of remedies becomes more acute in a case such as this, is alleged to be where the deficiencies and the proxy statement or at least many of them could not be discovered until some time after the trans -- the meeting in view of the facts which later came to light.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.907" offset="17439013">In such a situation, we would have some trouble invoking the jurisdiction of a court of equity to enjoin a proxy solicitation where the proxies had already been solicited, the meeting had been had and the transaction had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.928" offset="17515081">It might well be that the District Court would say, "We no longer had equity to enjoin the proxy solicitation."</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.892" offset="17542980">If so, the only remedy open to us is criminal prosecution and that's rather heavy artillery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.558" offset="17569625">According to Mr. Lassers' definitive text, there had been only three or four indictments in which proxy's violations were included among the charges and none before 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.524" offset="17633468">I next going to point out that contrary to the arguments that have been made at length by the petitioners, respondent's right of action does not depend upon a -- an affirmative finding that Congress intended in the Exchange Act to create this particular right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.145" offset="17711940">The foundation of respondent's rights is really based upon the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.027" offset="17735450">In Comyns' Digest, quoted by this Court in Texas &amp; Pacific versus Rigsby, it was said, "So in every case where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage or for the recompense of a wrong done to him contrary to the said law."</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.411" offset="17837014">It is upon that common law basis that this Court has created private rights of action in many situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.076" offset="17879646">And it is upon that common law basis that the lower courts have created private rights of action under the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.206" offset="17920188">This is expressly stated in the early cases, Kardon versus National Gypsum, the first case under Rule 10 (b) (5), Brown versus Bullock, approximately the first case of importance under the Investment Company Act and in Dann versus Studebaker-Packard which petitioners rely on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.915" offset="18007019">Section 27 of the Exchange Act, it suggested in the reply brief of the petitioners, merely grants jurisdiction over actions created by the Act, causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.291" offset="18060518">That is not what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.281" offset="18068459">It says that it gives jurisdiction over actions to enforce any liability or duty created by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.925" offset="18103045">It is the liability or duty which there is jurisdiction to enforce, not merely a cause of action created by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.603" offset="18141811">Professor Lassers summarized the nature of the private rights as follows."</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.552" offset="18161560">In short, the private action under the proxy rules is an action created by the federal common law and brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Commission's rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.839" offset="18222686">That's 73 -- Harvard Law Review 1273.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.043" offset="18239509">Of course, we would not say an action should be implied if Congress affirmatively did not intend one, that there is no showing of any affirmative intent on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.969" offset="18283290">That there should be no remedy for violation of the proxy rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.980" offset="18299277">Petitioners do not suggest that there is -- was such an intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.047" offset="18315577">They merely think that Congress should have had such an intention at the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.941" offset="18335117">There isn't -- since the purpose of proxy rules is to protect the stockholders' right of suffrage in view of the problems of enforcement above mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.358" offset="18376808">No congressional intent to withhold private rights completely can be -- be assumed -- presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.877" offset="18414843">Secondly, we believe in the petitioners' consent -- contention in the holding in Dann versus Studebaker-Packard, that stockholders' rights under the proxy rules, in a consummated transaction, are limited to a declaratory judgment, is in -- and any other remedy must be found under the state law is incorrect for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.438" offset="18501151">First, this Court has repeatedly held that the federal courts will afford inadequate remedy for breach of the federal right and not an inadequate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.545" offset="18541589">Secondly, this Court has repeatedly held that the right of action in the federal courts for a violation of a federally created right is governed by federal and not state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.070" offset="18591640">And thirdly, there is no effective state remedy or a proxy violation to which the petitioners can appropriately be remitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="4658.733" offset="18738343">As the -- the juries of the Court put that matter in Bingham versus Savings and Trust Company, 138 Atlantic 639, the plan must be free from unfairness before the complainants can be put to dereliction of joining their associates in the merger or taking compensation in lieu thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.847" offset="18826742">In the second place, the -- this remedy of appraisal can be invoked only if notice is given to the Corporation 48 hours before the meeting that the stockholder objects.</text>

            <text syncTime="4742.407" offset="19073024">As to the adequate -- as to the adequacy of remedy, Bell versus Hood expressly held that the federal courts would grant all necessary relief, Deckert versus Independent Share cited in our brief said much the same thing and the line of cases which follow, Texaco Workers versus Lincoln Mills, also indicate that the federal courts under a grant of jurisdiction such as is found at Section 27, will frame adequate remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.408" offset="19220982">Secondly, this -- the court -- federal courts have repeatedly held that the remedy to be granted to enforce a federal right is a matter of federal law and not state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.287" offset="19272495">It was so stated expressly in Lincoln Mills, in Sola Electric cited in our brief, and in Tunstall versus Brotherhood where the Court said, "The nature and extent of the legal consequences of this condemnation, i.e., that a certain conduct is unlawful, though left by the statute to judicial determination are nevertheless to be derive from it and the federal policy which it has adopted."</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.201" offset="19388165">In that connection, I would like to refer the Court to the case of the Union Pacific versus -- Railroad versus Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Company, likewise involving an alleged proxy violation in relation to a merger reported at 326 Federal Supplement 400, we cited in our brief by its case number but it has since been reported.</text>

            <text syncTime="4847.117" offset="19491819">326 Federal Supplement 400.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.125" offset="19507911">That case is a very instructive example of a District Court determining these problems, who has standing to sue whether there has been a violation of a proxy rule, whether the violation with the cause of the injury complained of, what remedy was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.651" offset="19581994">And I must say that the decision there -- there is no resemblance of all -- at all to the chamber of horrors into which Mr. Whyte attempted to leave this Court earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.794" offset="19634552">Union Pacific Railroad Company versus Chicago &amp; Northwester Railway Co., it is not a point on the question of upsetting a merger because the merger has not been -- been consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.829" offset="19678647">But it does show how a court goes about this when the Court has jurisdiction and this -- the Court in Chicago had jurisdiction, it thought because it believed the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case was controlling in that Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4924.475" offset="19801318">There, I would say, they were somewhat doubtful because it is expressly said that we can sue for an injunction and as respondent stated earlier in order to go further, we would have to, in effect, invoke an implied remedy too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.018" offset="19859414">I would like in closing point out that there is virtually no state law of proxy solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.984" offset="19887313">State statutes merely say that stockholders can vote by proxy and may regulate the authority in the creation of the proxy holders' of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.199" offset="19924198">That is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.628" offset="19929840">Consequently, Dann gives petitioners -- I mean plaintiffs any remedy which maybe totally illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.430" offset="19973099">This is illustrated by the situation in Delaware which is of course of very important corporate state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.568" offset="19997654">But Delaware -- the court of chancery held that it would not consider alleged violations of the proxy rules because the jurisdiction to do so is exclusively in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.389" offset="20048959">And therefore, it would grant only such relief on account of a proxy violation as it would give if the Securities Exchange Acts had never been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.723" offset="20086262">That is -- the decision is found at 48 Atlantic 2d 501, the Investment Associates versus Standard Power and Light.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.031" offset="20123460">The Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed, that decision is found at 51 Atlantic 2d 572 on the ground that to grant any relief for violation of the proxy rules would trespass upon the province of the federal courts and that even though a serious violation soliciting the proxy without furnishing any proxy statement appeared to have occurred that no objection could be sustained because this was not a ground to challenge a proxy under the General Corporation law of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.604" offset="20257834">It seems to us that these holdings would leave -- would mean that a Dann type declaratory judgment would afford rather scant comfort to a stockholder in a Delaware corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.171" offset="20332022">The question has been raised as to whether this action is derivative or not and what our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.294" offset="20360547">Our view essentially is that it doesn't matter whether it is classified for state purposes as derivative or direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.772" offset="20394506">That seems to depend on which end of the case you approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.187" offset="20408090">If you look at the stockholders' right to have a proper proxy and to cast and inform the vote, that is clearly a direct right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.542" offset="20445497">On the other hand, it may be that the only remedy that he can obtain is through the Corporation which has been injured as a result of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.161" offset="20491995">I'm not sure that that is the case in this situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.497" offset="20509341">But since we deal only with federal jurisdiction, it isn't really necessary yet to determine what remedy and whether --</text>
