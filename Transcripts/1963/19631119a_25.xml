            <label>Mr. Wayne L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="15.577" offset="165700">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.629" offset="185866">This is the case of a railroad section hand who brings his action against the Denver and Rio Grand Western Railroad Company, his employer, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.746" offset="246366">He alleges that a series of events took place on January 2nd and 3rd of 1960 and that he -- he was injured as a result of those events.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.059" offset="299656">He filed and tried his action in the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County and a jury returned the verdict in his favor in the amount of $20,000, reducing the verdict to $10,000 for contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.728" offset="374262">The Utah State Supreme Court reversed the finding of the jury as approved by the trial court and we are here today after the granting of a petition for writ of certiorari to determine this case on its merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.365" offset="444792">The facts of the case are simply this, an open joint between two rails had occurred some 16 miles out of Green River, Utah and it became necessary to repair this open joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.267" offset="516472">The crew consisting of the foreman Chronopolous, a truck driver and two section men, met at 5 p.m. on the late afternoon of January 2nd, at the tool house at Green River, Utah and proceeded by track to the appointed task out on the plains of Utah some 16 miles from the closest place where people resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.557" offset="641651">An open joint briefly is described as a situation which occurs when rails contract in extremely cold weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.669" offset="686059">These rails are some 39 feet in length and in this particular instance, the ex -- the contraction had caused an open -- opening between two joints of some 1 and 3/4 inches in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.590" offset="753768">These open joints are repaired briefly by the loosening of certain angle bars at each joint, working away from the open joint and then prying the rails toward the opening and ultimately realigning the holes between the angle bars and the rails, so that new bolts can be placed in the location on either side of the open joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.992" offset="879365">The crew of which the plaintiff was a member, was shorthand of a Mr. Powell, Delmar Powell, who is a regular member of this crew, could not be located and so to begin with, we have a shorthanded crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.938" offset="947075">Also, if other crews were available, if other crews were needed, our evidence and our testimony was that they were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.350" offset="988766">We have the testimony of the foreman Chronopolous to the effect that if other crew -- another crew was needed to relieve his crew, he could have asked for it, but that he didn't do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.717" offset="1046235">Also we had testimony from the plaintiff who was a 16-year section man with much experience in this area of work who testified that the repair of an open joint isn't in the nature of an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.153" offset="1107989">By the use of a Dutchman and train orders, trains can be slowed down at these open joints and can go across them at a restricted speed in very good order.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.751" offset="1162428">As a matter of fact on this particular night, as the night were long, three trains were slowed down thusly and proceeded across a Dutchman and to their appointed destinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.972" offset="1223241">The temperature was bitter cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.292" offset="1232541">The evidence is that the temperature range starting on this particular nights were from 10 degrees above until it reached 5 degrees below as the evening were long.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.504" offset="1281337">The evidence is that winds were blowing across this plain and through the cut where this open joint was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.771" offset="1314461">And that they were of such nature that the fire that this men devised by using an old railroad tie was inadequate to furnish effective heat for warming purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.774" offset="1366497">Although, this fire was the means provided that night for warming these men in turn as they went about their appointed task.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.149" offset="1415920">Now, the foreman was in continuous charge throughout the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.587" offset="1437759">He made the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.335" offset="1444760">He issued the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.119" offset="1451865">He decided who should work, where they should work and it was under his plan of work that these men in turn, went to the fire from time to time throughout the night in quest of warmth.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.796" offset="1510588">And at midnight, at midnight after these men had worked for some seven hours, the plaintiff testified that his hands were tingling.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.016" offset="1559385">He said they started to burn more less like your hand burns when it goes asleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.762" offset="1582373">And he notified the foreman of this fact and advised the foreman, he said, "I said it looks like my hand's frozen to the wrench" and yet he testified --</text>

            <text syncTime="394.412" offset="1681011">He stated, quote, "I said it looks like my hand's frozen to that wrench."</text>

            <text syncTime="402.464" offset="1713194">And the foreman himself testified, question - Now during this particular night, Mr. Chronopolous, did Mr. Dennis complained to you about the cold?</text>
            <text syncTime="413.147" offset="1755930">And his answer, "He did."</text>
            <text syncTime="415.740" offset="1766379">As the evening were long and the night moved toward the early morning hours, the fire grew dim and two men, one of whom was the plaintiff went out in quest of some other means of warmth and they tore a tie from a track car setter, brought the tie back to where they were working and made a new fire which they used for the rest of the shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.853" offset="1878810">The evidence is that a regular shift is eight hours and our testimony is that from the tool house -- back to the tool house, this evening was 12 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.007" offset="1927398">And so, there is the evidentiary basis upon which the plaintiff brings his case before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.483" offset="1965328">The temperature ranged from 10 degrees above to 5 degrees below zero during the course of these 12 hours, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.886" offset="2010885">The only man that was frostbitten was the plaintiff and yet the other member of the crew testified that all of these men were cold during this night and the plaintiff testified that this was the coldest night he ever remembers working on such a shift, on such a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.216" offset="2080266">Now, our first point of course is that there is an evidentiary basis for a filing of neglect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.701" offset="2110151">And in reviewing this evidentiary basis, we call attention to the remark of Justice Holmes in the Hadley case where he said that many times, "The hole maybe greater from the some of the parts in considering questions of neglect."</text>

            <text syncTime="545.753" offset="2286425">We have the second situation where the foreman at midnight being advised that the plaintiff's hand was frozen to the wrench, advised that the plaintiff was cold in this manner and aware of the surrounding circumstances failed to relieve the plaintiff of his task but kept him out in that cold taking his turn at the fire and that to work for an additional three and one half hours of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.298" offset="2520586">The jury believed it and the trial court believed it Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.922" offset="2535111">But when we reached the Utah Supreme Court, we found some disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.945" offset="2555173">The original opinion of the Utah Supreme Court contained an erroneous statement of fact on this particular matter, where the Utah Supreme Court stated it is undisputed that the only time he mentioned being cold, the foreman suggested that he go to the truck for that purpose and he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.336" offset="2644720">Now, this simply wasn't that fact because the plaintiff had denied saying and so after having this matter called to its attention, the Utah Court issued a corrected opinion and deleted this thing, deleted this statement of fact and then however, went ahead to say, however it is of significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.700" offset="2726222">Using this point, Justice White has brought up, it is of significance that other members of the crew denied this and stated and testified that at midnight after being advised of being -- of the cold, the foreman sent the plaintiff to the truck and he went there.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.882" offset="2802918">And of course, this is the kind of fact when and factual consideration of matters by the Utah Supreme Court with which we find disagreement here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.816" offset="2858611">The Utah Supreme Court stated at page 7 of its opinion, its corrected opinion, other than the reference to its attempt to try to get the one more crew member who couldn't be located there is no evidence that more men or crews were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.134" offset="2919946">This simply isn't supported by the record because foreman Chronopolous testified at record 116.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.415" offset="2948995">Question - Now, you have the right to request help from other crews don't you if you need them?</text>
            <text syncTime="717.945" offset="2975117">Answer - Yes, if I need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.335" offset="2984730">Question - If you felt that you needed help in this case, you could've asked for help from this other crew, couldn't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="726.800" offset="3010539">Answer - Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.674" offset="3018062">And of course that belies the statement of fact made by the Utah Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.237" offset="3044289">The Utah Supreme Court then went on to say, it must be appreciated that the railroad is in a business which literally moves on and must be kept moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.560" offset="3085563">And again, in the face of difficulty such as here arose it must resort to the best exit -- expedient available to meet these responsibilities and to keep its trains running on schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.919" offset="3135091">And then again, the jury cannot be allowed to second-guess management.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.817" offset="3158601">Of course, juries are allowed to second-guess management if the Court pleases, in all safe place to work cases for instance and many other cases where unsafe procedures and practices are alleged and proved in Federal Employers' Liability Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.922" offset="3235088">If the management's judgment is poor and a railroad man is injured as a result, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act it is our position that liability attaches and the idea that management could be its own judge and jury in matters of this kind are borne to the field of the Federal Employers' Liability Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.134" offset="3335920">Now, a summary of the Utah Supreme Court's opinion reduced to simplest terms, is that the that the railroad owes no duty of supervising the attire of its men, has no responsibility for weather conditions, is immune from liability for bad judgment on the part of management and therefore can keep its employees out in freezing weather as long as it desires whether it be eight hours or 12 hours or 20 hours with absolute impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.442" offset="3465174">It is our position that if the railroad company, it's foreman in this instance, has a duty to exercise a judgment as to the length of time that its men can reasonably be kept out under such adverse conditions as existed here, then it had to the duty to exercise that judgment by exercising ordinary care in exercising that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.114" offset="3567783">And if a jury could find that in that judgment, exercise of ordinary care is a question of -- on which reasonable minds may differ then our petition has merit here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.949" offset="3635179">Now, in the brief of the respondent, I want to quickly call attention to one or two factual mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.183" offset="3672064">At page 2, the statement appears, "All available section men in the area were called to assist in the repair."</text>
            <text syncTime="902.159" offset="3711979">And of course, I have already read the testimony of foreman Chronopolous that if he had needed and wanted to, he could've asked for another crew to relieve this crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.733" offset="3762343">Again at page 4, petitioner denied that he got into the track at midnight but he did not refute the testimony of the foreman that he was told to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.615" offset="3805811">However, at record 64, we find the following testimony from the plaintiff, "I don't remember him telling me get in no truck."</text>
            <text syncTime="936.092" offset="3847711">And then at page 5, petitioner made only one complaint about the cold at which time he was told to get into the heated cab of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.246" offset="3888358">And of course the testimony, the testimony of the plaintiff at record 64, "I don't remember him telling me to get in no truck."</text>
            <text syncTime="955.849" offset="3926810">And so at page 14, also contrary to fact is counsel's statement that the foreman knew that petitioner was in the process of suffering injury from overexposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.670" offset="3978010">There is no such evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.978" offset="3987310">And yet the record at page 35 and 36, Question - Was the foreman there too?</text>
            <text syncTime="977.437" offset="4013119">Answer - Foreman and two other men.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.041" offset="4023568">Question - What did you say?</text>
            <text syncTime="982.494" offset="4033390">Answer - I said it looks like my hand's frozen to that wrench.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.266" offset="4056482">Now, coming to point number 2 is our position also that the Utah Court has inappropriately found and held that the neglect of the plaintiff himself was the sole proximate cause of his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.255" offset="4120430">In the original opinion, the Utah Supreme Court referred to plaintiff's own neglect or error of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.285" offset="4144462">But in the re -- corrected opinion, we find a modification of that language to plaintiff's own conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.231" offset="4172257">But here, we have two men, the foreman in charge of this crew, having the responsibility for his men, having the right and the duty to determine how long they shall be kept out in these weather conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.857" offset="4230771">And taking his men out 16 miles onto an open plain, windy plain harboring around zero temperature throughout the night and keeping them there for 12 solid hours from portal-to-portal without so much as a coffee break, without so much as any relief other than occasional visits back to an inadequate fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.468" offset="4321259">And we have the plaintiff again, you'd answer, a man of limited experience trained to take and follow orders, going along with the foreman's instructions throughout that night and the Utah Court holding that the plaintiff was negligent but that the defendant had no responsibility and was free from negligence, and that is why we're here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.989" offset="4423346">Now, the third point which we raised in this appeal is that the doctrine of assumption of risk has been resurrected by the holding of the Utah Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.050" offset="4475591">Here is what the Utah Supreme Court said, "Neither party can be blamed for the cold weather, both were fully aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.429" offset="4509132">The plaintiff himself was in the best position to know about the sufficiency of his clothing and in fact holding that it's the plaintiff's responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.753" offset="4550405">He should seek some safe refuge from the cold that existed that night at his own peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.604" offset="4577782">He should meet head on the foreman who was in charge of this crew and resist the duties that were assigned by that foreman at his peril."</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.318" offset="4620622">And of course, this is contrary to the holding of the Taylor case which has stated that every message of the doctrine of assumption at risk has been obliterated from the law by the 1939 Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.417" offset="4817063">The Utah Supreme Court held that the undesired stop which caused -- may have caused the decedent's death in a philosophical sense but was not a cause in a legal sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.957" offset="5087169">It cannot stand against Bailey versus Central Vermont, where this Court stated to brief -- deprive railroad workers of a jury trial in close or doubtful cases is to take away a goodly portion of the relief which Congress has afforded them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.208" offset="5156237">And it cannot stand against the Rogers case where this Court say -- said that judicial appraisal is narrowly limited to the single inquiry, whether negligence of the employer played any part at all in producing the injury or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.205" offset="5224155">And it cannot stand against Jacob versus the City of New York, where this Court said that the right of trial by jury is a basic and fundamental feature of our system of jurisprudence, a right so fundamental and sacred to the citizens that it should be jealously guarded by the courts of our land.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.437" offset="5489142">And I wanted -- I called the attention particularly to the error that I think is most significant where the Utah Court when it decided to defeat the plaintiff's case was of the opinion that the fact was that at midnight, he had complained of the cold and had been sent to the truck where he remained the rest of the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.501" offset="5577331">Whereas the true fact was that he complained of the cold and of his fingers being frozen to the wrench at midnight, but was kept out in the cold, performing his work for an additional three and a half hours before being sent to the truck to turn it around at the very conclusion of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.019" offset="5659460">So, we will submit this case Your Honor with this statement, this old railroad (Inaudible) is entitled to its jury verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.488" offset="5729364">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.135" offset="5743888">My friend, Mr. Black, with whom I have tried many cases, has cited I think in his brief pretty well the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.405" offset="5773040">However, I think it would be important for me to cite some of the facts which I think are important to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.166" offset="5808044">The D&amp;RG operates in this particular area, across the Green River end up through the country about 16 miles from Green River where this accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.654" offset="5845974">D&amp;RG is most that you may know, is a relatively small mountain railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.594" offset="5865723">In the area of Green River, they have a section crew which is composed of from four to five men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.067" offset="5895607">On occasions, this section crew will only have two men out and on occasions, it will have five.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.663" offset="5922043">On this particular occasion, there was another section crew which was adjacent to this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.930" offset="5943045">In fact, the section crew which had supervision to the very track where these acts had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.286" offset="5964466">But this being a cold night and I think Mr. Black has stated the testimony correctly relative to this, is being a cold night, the rails had contracted and the railroad problem had developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.558" offset="6013576">And the problem which develops is that when the railroad contract it leaves an open -- opening between the tracks so that there is a very serious danger of derailment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.503" offset="6053386">And that therefore becomes necessary for the railroad to go over its track and correct these open -- openings in the rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.113" offset="6083793">On this particular case, the group that had control of this particular track where this particular open cut had occurred had already been called out as it appears in the record, to take care of another open -- opening in the rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.194" offset="6144188">And this particular crew, therefore, was called to go and take care of the opening in the rail which was on their division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.900" offset="6166967">So that in the record, there is no use talking about calling other help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.788" offset="6186506">True, Mr. Chronopolous said that he could have called other help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.374" offset="6204897">He could have called if the Court please, but there was no other help available because on this occasion, all of the section crews were out closing these openings on the rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.564" offset="6249618">Now, these openings in the rail as the record will show, have to be closed, otherwise there is serious danger of derailment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.241" offset="6284309">Now there's a temporary device which can be improvised for a temporary time in order to get the cars over the opening and that is they put in what is called a Dutchman as Mr. Black has explained to you which is a short piece of rail which fits into the opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.319" offset="6348675">And then if they have a man there, they can take the train cross very slowly over this opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.644" offset="6369991">But the undisputed testimony is that if you leave this opening in there very long, there's a danger that it might twist sideways and so that it will slip out so that you will have a derailment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.548" offset="6417533">And therefore, this temporary measure is only placed there while the men are working on these opening cuts and is not, and this is the decision of management, is not permitted to exist except temporarily while work construction is being -- is in progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.883" offset="6482944">On this particular night, there were six trains that were scheduled to go through this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.860" offset="6502797">In fact when this section crew got there on this occasion, one train was already waiting and this, I don't think suggested and I don't think should be held and I don't think the jury so found that the railroad is obligated to shutdown its operations during the night until it's daylight and until the weather is warm enough that they can make this correction in the opening in the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.176" offset="6612093">I don't even think Mr. Black suggests that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.000" offset="6623378">The question is how are we to do this work in the most reasonable manner?</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.062" offset="6643649">But Mr. Chronopolous, when he was called and told that there was a train waiting at this opening in the rail, called out his section crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.977" offset="6671235">He couldn't find one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.760" offset="6678444">One of them was missing, so he took only four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.468" offset="6693282">Before he took these men out, he noticed their clothing and he noticed that the plaintiff did not have on overshoes and that the plaintiff didn't have on woolen mittens like the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.531" offset="6733511">The plaintiff apparently had on two pair of gloves, a canvass glove and rubber glove which fit over this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.627" offset="6761932">Now, the plaintiff was a section man who had worked in this particular area where he lived most of his life and he worked for the railroad for 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.874" offset="6798817">And some comment was made by the section foreman and some discussion was had, he thought he was dressed warm enough and the plaintiff said, he thought he was and so they went out to the particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.640" offset="6849912">When they got out there, the first thing they did was split some ties and build two fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.570" offset="6873631">The way they do this worked two men worked on each joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.039" offset="6887528">They separate the joint and then they go on pull the 39 foot rails up gradually and they have to go several lanes back in order to bring up enough to fill in the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.884" offset="6922951">Two men worked on each joint, it is suggested by Mr. Black that we should've had more help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.227" offset="6948237">I don't know how we could've had more help when nor help is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.593" offset="6961716">But if we had, how that could've changed the nature of the work, two men working on each joint and having to wait until a rail was moved and the record will bear this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.192" offset="7008110">During the evening, the plaintiff indicated as has been indicated by Your Honor, that his hand was frozen to a particular wrench which he was working, which he had a glove.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.308" offset="7056593">He did not report to the foreman that this was in anyway doing him any damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.205" offset="7080208">He simply said that his hand was frozen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.735" offset="7090343">He said, however, in the trial, that at that time, he felt a tingling sensation in his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.525" offset="7117511">This -- not was in anyway -- this was in no way communicated to his foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.052" offset="7135587">Then there's a dispute in the evidence and of course, I agree with Mr. Black, we must indulge every inference in favor of the facts for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.193" offset="7164113">There's a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.711" offset="7170173">The plaintiff doesn't remember whether he was in the truck -- truck a half hour or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.804" offset="7194624">All the other witnesses testified that he claimed he was cold about midnight and he got in the truck and remained in the truck until they left the shift about 4 o'clock, which would mean he would be -- taking the testimony, if their testimony is correct, and I shouldn't even be wasting Your Honors' time with it because we must take his testimony, which he said, "He couldn't remember if he was in there about a half hour."</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.402" offset="7285008">He then went back and found out the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.949" offset="7295143">He, for the first time, found out that he was having this difficulty in his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.851" offset="7318758">Now, it seems to me that the case is relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.970" offset="7335267">It gets to this, is the -- does the railroad have a duty to see that a man is properly clothed before he goes out on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.390" offset="7372884">Even if there is that duty and no case is so -- it certainly so held at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.353" offset="7392737">Even if that's -- it has that duty, the plaintiff himself said he was properly clothed even though the foreman had some doubts about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.581" offset="7425651">And he said, "He, himself knew when he was warm and when he could go to the fire."</text>
