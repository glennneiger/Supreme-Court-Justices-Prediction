            <text syncTime="23.351" offset="196733">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.605" offset="209795">This comes to this Court on a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.199" offset="248142">That court affirmed a ruling of the trial court, Circuit Court of Woodbury County, Iowa, to the effect that the Union's participation or the employees' participation in a walkout can be effect of waiving the right of the Union to require the employer to arbitrate discharges which arose in the context of the walkout.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.878" offset="390875">As the matter came to the Iowa Supreme Court, it came there by way of an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the trial court under a rule of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 105, which is a rule that appears to be designed to make it possible for rulings of law, final determinations of law to be made in advance of disposition of the entire case where the facts which raise the issue of law are not contraverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.351" offset="556805">As the case commenced, it was a proceeding by the Union to require the employer to arbitrate grievances which the Union had presented under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.651" offset="617932">There were two grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.499" offset="625351">One was the discharge of one employee and the second grievance had to do with the discharge of approximately 190 other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.799" offset="670595">Insofar as the record discloses the facts from which these disputes arose, it discloses a set of facts very similar to the facts in the Enterprise Wheel case which was before this Court in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.268" offset="748440">There seems to have been a dispute between an employee and someone in management.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.923" offset="771114">That employee was discharged and then a significant number of other employees walked off the job, presumably in sympathy in protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.441" offset="821164">So that, the question that is presented here is whether or not the conduct of the employees, and possibly of the Union as well, precludes the Union from requiring the employer to arbitrate the disputes under the provisions of an arbitration clause which is certainly as broad as the arbitration clauses that were before this Court in the Steel Workers cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.355" offset="920743">The arbitration clause contains the language "disputes with reference to the proper interpretation or application of the provisions of the contract."</text>
            <text syncTime="214.628" offset="961912">It's our contention that, notwithstanding what appears to have been possibly illegal conduct under the contract by the employees and the Union, that the question of the discharges, whether they were for just cause, is a question which should be decided by the arbitrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.937" offset="1475166">The only decision that I think I would be inclined to agree with, which represents an instance in which the relationships between the parties had deteriorated to the point where it was probably proper to say that no contract remained, was Judge Nordbye's opinion in the Minnesota Joint Board case.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.232" offset="1548309">I don't think that situation is presented here, nor do I think that that situation is the situation that post in your hypothetical question.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.351" offset="1628766">That would be my point, yes.I think perhaps the problem is created for the courts by the somewhat ambiguous meaning of the term "arbitrability".</text>
            <text syncTime="396.423" offset="1689057">I'm sure that there is no question but what initially the term "arbitrability" is a -- an issue which has to be considered by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.767" offset="1726464">But, as I understand the decisions of this Court, it has instructed the lower courts that they are simply to concern themselves with the question of whether or not the dispute presented appears to be one on the face of the contract and the face of the arbitration clause that the parties bargain should go to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.454" offset="1813191">Here, however, we have an additional reason urged, not on the face of the contract, an additional reason urged why these grievances should not go to arbitration, the reason being the claim to misconduct of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.474" offset="1877243">It seems to me that that is something in the nature of an affirmative assertion or allegation, perhaps even an affirmative defense, which for a Court to decide would necessitate the hearing of evidence, a consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the strike, the consideration to what extent the officials of the Union participated in the walkout, either encouraged it or stood by and did nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.114" offset="1991868">It seems to me that if the contract, in its wording, in the arbitration clause appears to be such that the dispute hear a discharge should go to arbitration, that that issue of arbitrability, properly a judicial question, can be determined without the hearing of any evidence which may bare upon what I've described as in the nature of an affirmative defense to it.I would say that when the matter goes to the arbitrator, it would be perfectly proper at that point for the employer to assert that, by reason of the wrongful misconduct of the Union, it should not have the benefits of arbitration in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.989" offset="2167306">Or, another type of affirmative assertion that might be made is that, notwithstanding what appears to be the language of the arbitration clause, the history of bargaining over the years indicates quite clearly that the particular kind of dispute which has arisen is one that the parties previously had come to an understanding, although not expressed in writing, should not be heard by the arbitrator.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard F. Watt</label>
            <text syncTime="544.787" offset="2282559">I think the arbitrator could hear and pass upon the very argument which the respondent is making in this Court and wants the courts to pass upon, and I think it would require -- before the issue could be decided, it would require a full hearing of the evidence and the facts and circumstances surrounding the events which lead to the discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.182" offset="2376077">The difficulty, it seems to us, in having a court pass on these issues, as the Iowa courts did, without hearing evidence but simply on the face of the pleading is it's extremely difficult for a court to consider as a defense to the question of arbitrability the facts and circumstances surrounding the strike without coming perilously close to determining whether or not there was just cause for discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.189" offset="2508152">I believe, conceptually, you can separate the two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.499" offset="2521318">You can say that one issue is simply the question as to whether or not the Union conduct is of such a nature that the contract relationship has deteriorated to the point where the employer is no longer bound to arbitrate the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.370" offset="2580877">I think that is an issue which could be posed and, apart from the evidentiary problems, probably could be passed on by a court, but what appears to us to be the inherent difficulty of the question is that once a court enters upon that, I think it is extraordinarily hard for it not virtually to decide whether or not there was just cause for the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.489" offset="2677321">I say questions conceptually are separate, but the evidence and the arguments which would go to the decision of the two questions are so closely related that once a court determines that it may properly decide whether this particular affirmative defense to the petition to seeking arbitration is a good one or not, it almost inevitably is going to be entrenching upon the question of whether or not the discharges which are the heart of grievances were for proper cause under the terms of the contract because, obviously, in some situations, arbitrators will hold that employees walking off the job without proper justification may be discharged and that that action of employees constitutes just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.353" offset="2872822">But, that question is so closely related to the question which is here urged as a defense to arbitration at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.607" offset="2913782">Is so closely related -- these two questions are so closely related that I do not see how a court, mindful of the decisions of this Court as to the limited function that the Court is to engage in, can decide one question with almo -- out almost inevitably deciding the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.088" offset="3007718">So that, it seems to me, that perhaps the problem can be helped some and the issue clarified some for the guidance of lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.484" offset="3053275">If it is recognized that, initially, arbitrability is for the court to decide on the face of the contract and the language which the parties have used but that, once the matter goes to the arbitrator, there may be much more detailed considerations which the arbitrator may consider and which may lead the arbitrator to conclude that, in this particular circumstance, the conduct of one party or the other precludes it from having the merits of the -- of the grievance finally determined by way of arbitration, so that there may be two levels of the issue of abitrability.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.463" offset="3289213">No, I don't think that it would be because, I think, there is -- there are two separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.874" offset="3314918">One of which, obviously, would be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Board, namely, whether there was an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.238" offset="3340309">Nowe, the second question might well be whether there had been a violation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.841" offset="3354728">And, I think those two questions are separate even though the facts and circumstances bearing on the two questions may be very, very similar, if not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.813" offset="3410631">As I understand respondent's argument here, it is that we do not have a situation comparable to that in Drake Bakeries because the arbitration clause here is narrower and, conceitedly, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.623" offset="3485863">In Drake Bakeries, of course, the arbitration clause was so broad that this Court held that the employer had agreed by the provisions of that arbitration clause to have to go to arbitration even the question as to whether the Union should be required to pay damages for breach of contract by engaging in a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.575" offset="3569664">There's no question that the arbitration clause here does not go nearly so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.394" offset="3596936">The arbitration clause here, first of all, is concerned with the interpretation of the contract, and the only kind of issues which can go to it are those which the Union asks to go to arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.382" offset="3804871">If it arose in a different context, it might be an issue which would not probably be one to go to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.598" offset="3829739">But, here, as a matter of fact, it is quite clear, since the employers filed a counterclaim and since there is no question but what the employer has a right to have that counterclaim heard by the court and determined, that the employer retains his judicial remedy for any breach of contract by the Union and he has a right to sue, under Section 301, and pursue that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.366" offset="3920854">And, he has not given up that remedy by virtue of this particular contract, whereas, in the Drake Bakeries case, he had agreed to give up a court remedy for that type of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.793" offset="3978533">Consequently, in this case, it seems to me that the reasoning applicable in the Drake Bakeries case is just as strongly in favor of having this issue go to arbitration, the grievances here, as in the Drake Bakeries case, not withstanding the difference in the two arbitration clauses and for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.526" offset="4065468">In this case, the employer retains his remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.461" offset="4085217">He has filed a counter claim asking for damages in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.538" offset="4105488">That counter claim is not proceeding at the present time because all proceedings in the Iowa court have been stayed, pending the determination of these issues, so that he has not restricted himself to have questions as to the violation of contract by the Union which may lead to his right to damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.201" offset="4180198">He still has his court remedy and is not compelled to have that question heard by the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.983" offset="4207261">So that, when the respondent indicates that, by reason of the narrower arbitration clause here, it is not broad enough to concern itself for the question of walkouts and strikes amounting to substantial breach, I think it is necessary to clarify that assertion and indicate that, in part, what the respondent says is correct but, impart, what he says is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.362" offset="4308825">He is correct insofar as he is interpreting this contract and this arbitration clause as not requiring the employer to arbitrate any claim for damages he may have by reason of the conduct to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.206" offset="4360234">But, it seems to us, he is incorrect insofar as he indicates that this arbitration clause would not permit the arbitrator to consider whether or not the strike, action or walkout action by the Union, precluded the type of remedy which the Union seeks to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.382" offset="4436929">I think it's necessary to consider in what context the issue was to be decided and, if it's in the context to have a claim for damages, then, obviously, that should be heard by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.382" offset="4480920">If it's in the context of a claim that employees were improperly discharged, then, it seems to me, the issue is properly one here for the arbitrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.526" offset="5981497">Now, preliminarily, there are two issues which have been raised which I would like to comment very briefly on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.994" offset="6023398">The respondent contends that the judgment of the Iowa court is not a final judgment and, therefore, is not reviewable by this Court under Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.418" offset="6073031">It seems to me that, in the practical terms and using the practical test which this Court has employed in many cases, the judgment below is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.215" offset="6116185">The only thing that remains undisposed off is the respondent's counter claim for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.672" offset="6146069">Now, admittedly, that counter claim for damages, if and when it goes to trial, will involve a lot of questions that are very similar to the questions that would be involved before an arbitrator in connection with these grievances but, so far as the right of the petitioner to obtain arbitration is concerned, the judgment of the Iowa court puts an end to that for all practical purposes, except in the remote circumstance that respondents -- respondent suggests, namely, after a trial of a counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.406" offset="6273024">If they were determined that the petitioner had not violated the no-strike clause, then the petitioner could ask the Iowa court to change its and reopen its decision and, at that point, perhaps order arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.245" offset="6324328">I agree that that is a hypothetical possibility but it's so remote as a practical matter and it's so remote in time that, if arbitration were to be ordered some-two or three years from now, after a trial of counterclaim, it seems to me, would have no work whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.853" offset="6386813">And, furthermore, as far as any further proceedings in the Iowa courts are concerned, we took the matter to the Iowa Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.833" offset="6414712">There's no place else in Iowa to go, so that it is a determination of an issue in this case, finally, by the Highest Court in Iowa that can pass on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.637" offset="6465912">Secondly, there is, urged in the respondent's brief, the contention that there are certain undenied allegations in an amendment that -- or an answer that respondent filed to an amendment to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.033" offset="6539473">I endeavor to cover that matter in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.448" offset="6557132">Under Iowa law, where the issues are properly framed by a complaint or a petition and an answer, a reply is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.296" offset="6588583">A reply or a responsive pleading following an answer under Iowa law is necessary only if the answer raises new issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.634" offset="6629857">And, in connection with the strike, the circumstances surrounding the alleged strike, the number of people who left their jobs, the matter of the picket line, and so on, those issues were all properly raised and fully raised by the pleadings prior to the amendment which respondent asserts we did not respond to or did not answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.225" offset="6708224">So that it would be our contention that, on the pleadings, no further pleading was necessary and that this Court could not properly take as undenied the allegations that were contained in the amendment to the answer which the respondent filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.462" offset="6785233">There is a -- the Iowa Supreme Court never dealt with that because the matter was not raised at any point in the proceedings prior to the brief filed by respondent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.228" offset="6840299">We urge that the judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.545" offset="7017514">First, and there's no argument here, the Union has conceded below, concedes here, and Mr. Watt again has conceded in argument the employer's right to sue over the breach of the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.856" offset="7070804">That in a breach of the no-strike clause as a concept, at least as he put it, is a non-arbitrable matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.989" offset="7103300">Thus, from the beginning, we don't have the situation that was presented in Drake and in Atkinson.</text>

          <turn speaker="alfred_l_scanlan" startTime="1757.626" stopTime="1863.198">
            <label>Mr. Alfred L. Scanlan</label>
            <text syncTime="1757.626" offset="7133915">Yes, that's -- the claim for damages, Mr. Justice White, for breach of the no-strike clause is a non-arbitrable matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.703" offset="7162232">Therefore, we don't have the problem this Court had to wrestle within Drake and in Atkinson, for that matter, to determine whether the breach was included under or out of the arbitrational clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.762" offset="7206431">Also, as in Atkinson, and unlike Drake, only the Union could petition for a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.775" offset="7234435">And, finally, the -- and this point I don't think has been touched upon, the no-strike clause in this case is much broader than the no-strike clause in Atkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.764" offset="7270379">In Atkinson, actually, the Union had a right to strike over matters that were not subject to the grievance procedure, provided they gave notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.952" offset="7303189">Here, on the record at pages 8 and 9 where the no-strike clause is set forth, it is perfectly clear that it bars all strikes and walkouts and work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.065" offset="7347597">Finally, with respect to the no-strike clause, and I think this is important in light of the shaky denials that the Union persists in that they didn't call, sanctioned, or support the strike, it doesn't make any difference for this Court's determination of this case because the no-strike clause finds both the employees and the Union, it says it has agreed that, during the period of the agreement, the employee shall not engage in and the Union shall not call or sanction any slowdown, work stoppage, or strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.139" offset="7479881">And, we're talking here about the reinstatement of the employees who walked out, so whether or not the Iowa court went beyond the permissible realm of judicial notice and pierce the pleadings to find that the Union was supporting the strike, it doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.313" offset="7540590">We'll deal with it as a walkout by these 191 employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.021" offset="7835460">I assume if the walkout was unjustified, the management wasn't perhaps justified in treating the no-strike clause as breached but the issues are there back in Iowa in the counterclaim, the same issues that Mr. Watt would send to the arbitrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.669" offset="12062072">I agree that the mutually dependent Covenant Doctrine is not applicable as such to labor Union contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.037" offset="12127483">But, they are not that different and the clauses that are important to the various parties are many, and I don't argue that, in every negotiation, the no-strike clause is given in exchange for the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.119" offset="12179832">But, certainly, the negotiating parties regard them as having some correlation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.574" offset="12213687">I think at least the two clauses have this in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.695" offset="12226121">Both aim at labor peace, both aim at continued production and employment, and both of them the no-strike clause on the one hand and the arbitration clause on the other, represent a very valuable concession by the respective party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.457" offset="12285158">For the employer, on the arbitration clause, he has given up the right, in effect, to manage his business in a certain area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.362" offset="12312848">For the Union, by giving the no-strike no-walkout clause, they surrendered a very valuable economic right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.571" offset="12337612">So, while they may not be quid pro quo, and I don't argue that they are and I agree that there's a difference, nevertheless, they are important to the parties and they have some relation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.903" offset="12414934">At Page 13 of their reply brief, they said, "No one pretends that a no-strike clause guarantees an employer against strikes."</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.993" offset="12579297">But, I will agree that maybe the importance of the no-strike clause, which is the employer's guarantee of industrial peace during the period of agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.556" offset="12625586">Perhaps, in the Steel Industry, for instance, it isn't -- it's important but not so bad as a strike, but as merely cessation of production and you stop sales at a profit.</text>
