            <text syncTime="16.555" offset="169566">As a preparatory remark, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of my client, Winston Massiah, for the right to present this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.056" offset="215646">I know there are many more momentous cases, money wise but I think, the -- I wish to thank the Court particularly for the cooperation they have assisted me in having the briefs printed in view of the fact that my client was incarcerated and indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.208" offset="288162">I feel that it's in the finest traditions of our free country and it's -- and in the finest traditions in its concern with the rights of individual citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.576" offset="329644">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.772" offset="338422">Before going into the law, I think it's necessary in this case to deal with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.483" offset="369351">And in dealing with the facts in this case I think there are three dates which are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.022" offset="407489">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.770" offset="414490">The first date which is of prime importance, which I think we should commit to memory is May 6, 1958 because on May 6, 1958, Winston Massiah, the defendant, appellant, petitioner here was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.947" offset="479169">He was arrested for a crime of smuggling, smuggling a package of narcotics across on a ship without having paid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.528" offset="521488">That's basically the indictment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Carluccio</label>
            <text syncTime="108.976" offset="539251">Massiah was a seaman, yes, Your Honor, an able-bodied seaman, that was his rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.089" offset="563702">On that date, he was arrested for a crime which allegedly occurred on that date again, May 6, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.744" offset="602363">Shortly thereafter, he was taken to custody, he was questioned by the federal officers, he -- he said nothing as the testimony showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.890" offset="642905">However, he retained counsel shortly thereafter, not myself, but a Mr. (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="141.538" offset="669550">And short time later, a May -- on May 28, 1958, he was indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.328" offset="696717">Around that time, I was retained by -- Mr. Massiah substituted for -- for Mr. (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="155.354" offset="724825">And I remained as counsel in that -- in this case from then May 9th -- May 28th, 1958 to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.853" offset="766830">At the time, he retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.926" offset="783026">He was still in jail, still incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.036" offset="795564">Subsequently, after motion to reduce the bail, the bail was lowered and he was out on bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.762" offset="826389">At the time that I was retained, I spoke -- the first person to whom I spoke within the case was an agent Finbarr Murphy, a very key figure as you will see later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.440" offset="873096">My retainer and my appearance was on the record from approximately the 28th of May, 1958 to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.817" offset="910608">What happened then?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.251" offset="916355">Nothing happened for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.053" offset="923564">There was no prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.578" offset="929729">There were delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.390" offset="932968">There were adjournments.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.580" offset="937671">There were many, many reasons why it was not tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.951" offset="951150">And a year passed, it came to the next important date which was July 22nd, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.355" offset="984795">And on July 22nd, 1959, another very important thing happened with reference to the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.699" offset="1014157">Massiah, the defendant, was indicted with the co-defendant, Jesse Colson.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.635" offset="1037876">Now, Jesse Colson was indicted for the same crime that Massiah was indicted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.242" offset="1072358">If you'll notice in the latter pages of my brief, I had printed each one of the indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.541" offset="1101511">And the indictments, as you will see, are word for word copies, maybe there was a slight variation of words but nothing substantial with reference to the Massiah and Colson indictment, all that was done, was the word "Colson" was added and Jesse Colson.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.836" offset="1166712">The -- the indictment was essentially the same</text>

            <text syncTime="471.365" offset="1988838">The Government had prevailed upon Colson, Colson being in a lesser fortunate position than Massiah.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.106" offset="2067832">Finbarr Murphy, fine gentleman who I respect but was involved in this, working for the Government, Finbarr Murphy, working for the U.S. attorney, Finbarr Murphy was the -- I would almost sequest as the majordomo of this case, he heard the case backwards, forwards, better than even I could understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.272" offset="2144423">I have to having leave with it for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.678" offset="2154036">But Murphy said this, he said to Colson or arranged with Colson to get Massiah into a conversation and there would be an electronic device transcribing and eavesdropping on this conversation.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.753" offset="2266363">And Jesse Colson called Massiah to speak with him privately.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.281" offset="2288515">They wouldn't talk on the phone because what they had to say, they didn't want or won't discuss over the phone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1115.730" offset="4566288">These motions were denied immediately but the next day, the judge granted the -- after reconsideration, he granted the mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.938" offset="4595127">The Government started their case and they proceeded with their case with their threads of -- of circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.252" offset="4632430">Betty Lloyd who was the former girlfriend of Massiah, who is testifying against him, the tape that they said matched the tape in Massiah's room and many other small, as I say, threads of circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.600" offset="4705782">Again, they -- they -- I -- I believe they were worried about their case, worried about proving it beyond reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.384" offset="4732949">So, not having Colson, what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.929" offset="4747055">They brought in agent Finbarr Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.874" offset="4758862">They brought in agent Finbarr Murphy with the tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.425" offset="4769102">They brought in agent Finbarr Murphy with a stenographic transcript of what the conversation was on the tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.533" offset="4801494">Now, at the time that they put agent Finbarr Murphy on the stand, so testify, counsel made serious objection, defense counsel, the person, myself, meant serious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.387" offset="4852903">My objections were -- were twofold on two separate occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.256" offset="4868368">I set them forth on page 15 and page 19 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.150" offset="4888012">They essentially say this, that the objection to Mr. Murphy's testimony is that it violates the defendant's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.582" offset="4933674">It constituted, I use the word "constituted eavesdropping" and also was a tape recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.064" offset="4959587">I reiterated on page 19 what I meant by the reason for the tape recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.658" offset="4982053">In that, it was an inanimate recording and not selective of what was heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.179" offset="5004100">At the time of this tape recording, a great many things in two hours were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.348" offset="5024789">I was discussed, my merits were discussed, many confidential communications were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.725" offset="5050284">There are great many things were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.094" offset="5059793">And I said because of its non-selectivity, how reliable it is, how probative is it and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.269" offset="5088423">I added to that that it did not bring in the demeanor of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.669" offset="5110053">It did not show not only what was said but how was it was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.656" offset="5133981">What -- what were the circumstances surrounding it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.944" offset="5147146">It's a -- almost a fundamental law of evidence that a -- admission against interest -- you can always explain the circumstances surrounding an admission against interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.522" offset="5197511">These could not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.143" offset="5203989">These could not be done by Finbarr Murphy, it could only be done by Colson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.414" offset="5229066">It would have to be done by Massiah because Massiah doesn't have to take the stand but Colson is the one who was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.157" offset="5256025">And in this situation, as I said, all Finbarr Murphy did was see heads in the back of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.850" offset="5282774">We would never know whether Colson had a gun up against Massiah at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.791" offset="5314539">He couldn't see it would be the back of the car but the -- I'm not alleging that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.812" offset="5330631">We don't really know what happened at the time but this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.839" offset="5346722">Again, the right of cross-examination foundation with reference to Colson is -- with reference in Colson is in the nefarious character with reference to his background, with reference to how reliable a witness is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.596" offset="5401788">This was all circumvented, this was all aviated by the fact they have the agent testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.110" offset="5431777">They sort of sanitized themselves in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.612" offset="5445778">But I pointed out again on page 19 that the most reliable evidence would be the evidence of -- of Colson's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.925" offset="5491022">I made an analogy between the photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.721" offset="5502307">They introduced photograph of the tape, the adhesive tape and they said that the -- it matched by virtue of the photograph and the judge wouldn't allow the photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.308" offset="5540655">He said the tape is the best evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.267" offset="5548492">In likewise manner, the -- the statements of Colson is the best evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.834" offset="5566673">Over objection -- over objection the evidence was introduced and why do -- what -- what decision could the judge hang his head upon?</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.947" offset="5619127">He hang his head upon the On Lee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.084" offset="5631666">That was -- that was the case upon which he decided to allow the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.401" offset="5644936">The 5-to-4 decision of the On Lee case which the Chief Justice has recently said in the Lopez case was wrongly decided and should not be revitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.460" offset="5689240">Well, we go along with that that the On Lee case was wrongly decided and should not be revitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.602" offset="5717765">If the discussing effects I think we come to a point as to why this case is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.375" offset="5740857">Why it has -- I -- I think great effect and why it's almost a landmark case, not because it involves a little man like Massiah or because, I'm arguing it, the question is this, it has a great many principles running through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.783" offset="5814523">If we learned in geometry that a point can be crossed by any number of straight lines, well, I would say, the circumstances of a case can be crossed by many, many principles, especially constitutional or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.356" offset="5880769">If we would take that Massiah's circumstances as a point in our mind, a mythical point in our mind, we would cross it first with the line of the Fifth Amendment -- of -- of the Sixth Amendment, I'm sorry, the Sixth Amendment, the right of counsel, the right of confrontation, the right of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.452" offset="5953181">I'll deal with these points more fully but I just want to show the Court by way of tribute, these -- these simple principles that are concerned basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.714" offset="5990275">Again, the next principle I would cross to the Massiah case would be the Fifth Amendment, the right of self-incrimination and due process under Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.253" offset="6028413">Again, another principle that crosses through this Massiah case is Canon 9 of the -- of ethics of the American -- the Canons of Ethics of the American Bar Association, which are a -- a lawyer's repetition just for -- of necessity for the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.777" offset="6110438">We also have Rule 93 of the rule-making power, the question of fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.207" offset="6136247">This crosses though the facts in the Massiah case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.057" offset="6151607">By other principles, we have the right of privacy is also concerned with this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.918" offset="6179088">We have again the Fourth Amendment, illegal searches and seizures, if they cannot get it one way, they get the same thing by a more subtle and sophisticated way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.809" offset="6222660">They cannot go into drawers of my desk and get my file but they can get my case in -- in other manners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.254" offset="6248364">In addition, we have a question of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.877" offset="6258918">If we are to be bound by the -- the idea that all conversations would be eavesdrop so readily and so freely, then it might -- it might -- make people hesitate from expressing either on popular ideas or confidential communications with reference to the first point, the Sixth Amendment, the right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.174" offset="6372080">Your Honors well ruled recently in the Spano case, that the right of counsel is a very important right also in Gideon versus Wainwright, was a very important right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.769" offset="6418474">And in Spano, Spano was, I believe, under indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.785" offset="6706552">We have a whole line, which was stated in the brief, a whole line of New York cases, Davis, Di Biasi, Meyer, Meyer which was stated by the -- as a footnote in the Chief Justice's decision in the Lopez case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.271" offset="6820446">These cases were, generally, around the time of arraignment, post-arraignment, pre-indictment or pre-arraignment, post-indictment, a variation of that type around this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.306" offset="6864645">Here, we have the indictment, the arraignment, the setting of the bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.680" offset="6886066">He was out on bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.025" offset="6891499">He had counsel for over a year and a half and yet, the Government dealt around counsel, not through a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.842" offset="6934758">There's a very important recent case with -- which would bares on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.813" offset="6954611">This was Griffith versus Rhay, a Ninth Circuit case, 282 F.2d 711.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.285" offset="6984495">And in Griffith versus Rhay, again, there was no question of coercion as in many of this other case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.916" offset="7223045">It's -- it has to be, to some extent, that way because if you have, but I think the more important thing is the Fifth Amendment, if you have a right against self-incrimination, then you have a right to have that right protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.455" offset="7285217">And the right to have that right protected is by virtue of your right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.162" offset="7307995">The New York cases stated this, the whole line that I stated, not only went off on the right of counsel but also I -- I only mentioned the right of counsel but also I mention that the Fifth Amendment, showing how intertwined these -- these cases were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.552" offset="7369540">The -- there were a line of cases that we set forth in our brief with reference to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.939" offset="7391169">These cases were Bram, Bullock and Brock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.562" offset="7405589">I'll take care of the easiest one, Bullock which a -- was a case in this area where a Negro was -- was beat up in a police station and his evidence and the -- and the evidence after his submission was set aside and precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.061" offset="7471626">We don't have a question of physical beating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.163" offset="7479986">We don't have the question like that but you can -- you can persuade, you can entice, you can obtain this evidence in -- in ways that are may -- maybe more subtle and yet, the courts have held that this manner in which this evidence is obtained and introduced is -- is not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.176" offset="7572041">A good case was the case of Bram.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.587" offset="7581759">Bram, the Bram case which was cited in our brief was a case of a sailor, strangely we have a sailor up in Nova Scotia who was accused of complicity in the crime and Bram was taken into a -- an office by a -- a Halifax officer, police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.404" offset="7660962">He was stripped in a ways that he was question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.993" offset="7671306">He made certain damaging admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.263" offset="7680397">The Court said that these admissions were not admissible because he wasn't aware and had no opportunity to avail himself of the right of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.534" offset="7725537">Another interesting case on the Fifth Amendment was Brock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.376" offset="7748838">And in Brock, we have a case where there was a steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.255" offset="7776423">And this man was sleeping in a house near this steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.809" offset="7794604">The federal officers, the revenuers came and they -- they spoke with him, and the gentlemen who was asleep got up and waived his hand and said, "Get away" and he was actually asleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.437" offset="7841102">Then, they -- they saw that he was really in a deep sleep but he would speak in his sleep and they questioned him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.233" offset="7864299">They got admissions against his interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.742" offset="7874330">And then the government agencies -- agents admitted, they went in and shook him and woke him up finally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.468" offset="7901288">The Court was -- held that this evidence was not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.744" offset="7918320">I would not say that Massiah was asleep at the time but they did take a great unfair advantage and he might have been, how would you say, legally asleep at the time which his lawyer would not be legally asleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.892" offset="7966908">He probably was lolled in a -- in a sense of false security in the idea that it was a year and a half after the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.784" offset="7998464">Colson was a -- a former co-acquaintance of his.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.601" offset="8017795">They were both -- they were both indicted and they were both defendants in the case and maybe they should work together to defend themselves for their mutual interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.863" offset="8062830">But I say that these cases show that the Fifth Amendment was protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.194" offset="8088116">Now, the next point is Canon 9 of the Canons of Legal Ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.507" offset="8113403">I raise this point not to disbar or -- or call ethics on -- on a fellow attorney for affirming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.013" offset="8147466">Most of the U.S. Attorneys with whom -- with whom I dealt have been fine and gentle individuals and I have no complaint along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.762" offset="8182471">However, in a law review, 42 Nebraska Law Review, 600 and 605, Professor Broder states that the Massiah case, this case, is the only case that brought into -- into focus Canon 9 of the Canons of Professional Ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.686" offset="8270137">And what does this canon say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.841" offset="8278706">The canon simply says, "I shall not deal with my adversary's client directly."</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.752" offset="8306395">That's -- that simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.264" offset="8312456">And I -- I will not -- as a corollary to it, I will not have any agents of mine doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.405" offset="8337011">Now, the -- the professor in the article points out this, and -- and I think he makes a very good point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.637" offset="8369925">He says -- let's take the example with a civil action, a negligence case, a $50 property damage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.251" offset="8400332">If my adversary's client want -- were suing me for negligence in a $50 property damage case, I could not deal with him directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.348" offset="8440769">I would probably be censured for doing such a thing or if I had my insurance adjuster dealing with the client directly once knowing that -- that counsel has been retained, I could not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.844" offset="8490715">Well, if this is so and all that rights are protected under a -- a property rights, how much more should a person's rights be for a $50 property damage to nine years in -- in the Atlanta penitentiary?</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.752" offset="8554350">I feel that this -- this is a good point well-made and that the -- what good is your right of counsel, what good is the -- the canon of ethics if the Government can take them in, question them, pamper for admissions, train and try and then turn them back to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.635" offset="8625925">The argument has also made that the canon bares on the Sixth Amendment, the violation -- that the violation of this canon is a violation of right of counsel per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.001" offset="8675349">It also states that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is violated by the violation of this canon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.606" offset="8705755">I've also cited (Inaudible) on legal ethics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.909" offset="8738983">The next point which I wish -- wish to bring up is the rule-making power, Rule 93.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.711" offset="8774196">The -- this -- I feel that even if we do not wish to go to constitutional questions, the reprehensible act here should be precluded if only by the rule-making power because we have the question of fundamental fair play and fundamental justice herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.889" offset="8858937">The -- Justice Black -- Mr. Justice Black in the On Lee dissent cited that On Lee -- the evidence in On Lee should not be admitted if only for the rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.515" offset="8909406">It did not go along with the right of privacy argument but he said in the rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.988" offset="8939290">In a Harvard Law Review, they -- they succinctly crystallized the rule-making power stating, "Since the prime rationale for the supervisory power relates to the integrity of judicial process, the Court should be able to exclude evidence derived from tactics which, though not unlawful, are so unfair that their toleration would force -- force the disrespect of the law or impair confidence in its administration."</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.741" offset="9058304">I say that is the rationale and I endorse that completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.198" offset="9080142">The Chief -- the Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice in the Lopez case, in his concurring opinion, went to the extent to go -- go deeper into this question of the rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.876" offset="9138866">He pointed out, either directly or indirectly, what the harms and dangers are in allowing this type of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.844" offset="9178781">He pointed out, I would say, indirectly but it was pointed out, that the right of confrontation and cross-examination of the informant, who was really, I would call a so-called "informant" because he was an informant before the fact as to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.384" offset="9248893">He was an informant to pump Mr. Massiah to violate his -- his rights of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.038" offset="9279509">But let's call him the informant just for the -- for a label.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.482" offset="9293302">The informant did not take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.859" offset="9302810">We couldn't see his -- his manner of testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.908" offset="9319006">We couldn't cross-examine the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.081" offset="9331649">Confrontation is a right guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.384" offset="9344920">Cross-examination, that's only inferentially derived from that but it's -- it's a right under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.771" offset="9374490">Again, the demeanor, how -- how he said these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.353" offset="9388805">Again, another very important point was the whereabouts, the domicile of Colson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.722" offset="9414301">Colson at that time was being protected by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.836" offset="9426735">We didn't know where he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.258" offset="9432377">We didn't know at all where he lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.733" offset="9442304">And a person has -- there -- there are numerous cases where a person who's going to testify has to state, "I live in such and such a place."</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.863" offset="9474800">Whether -- if only for the reason that we can impeach his reputation for truth and veracity in the community in which he lives, that everyone in the community knows he's a liar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.603" offset="9521821">But we never knew his whereabouts in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.807" offset="9734562">Again, by allowing the sanitary proof or the insulated proof of the agent, we lose another very important point in the -- in the circumstances, the whole atmosphere of the conversation and that is whether there were any other monitored or unmonitored, this was set forth by the Chief Justice, any other monitored or unmonitored conversations taken by Colson with -- made by Colson with Massiah which would have a bearing on the way Massiah spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.107" offset="9875832">Again, we have another point at which the Chief Justice may, that the friendship approach, we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.341" offset="9904776">We don't know what persuasion whether it was physical, whether it was mental, whether it was psychological, whether it was as in Spano, where they appealed saying "My wife and children, my wife is having a baby, I'll lose my job."</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.034" offset="9951483">We don't know what the -- what the persuasion was because Colson didn't testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="2470.271" offset="9984502">I would just venture to say that the fact that Colson and Massiah were both co-defendants in the case and the fact that Massiah thought that Colson was -- was still co-defendant and not a federal agent, would indicate that there might have been a -- a pooling of efforts or a persuasion to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.717" offset="10066213">We don't know and that's a big thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.923" offset="11111111">I could say that the points of -- of right of counsel was never raised in On Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.572" offset="11133680">On Lee didn't -- at the -- as far as I know, On Lee didn't have any counsel at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.985" offset="11155310">And in addition to which, if On Lee was in -- in the -- the evidence that was taken with On Lee was at the time of the crime and that part and parcel of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.224" offset="11200240">I think he went into the store and said, "Do you have the -- the opium under the counter?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.906" offset="11219048">And he said, "Yes, I have the opium under -- under the counter."</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.304" offset="11228557">He was way off the sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.271" offset="11236498">And he -- and the agent heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.721" offset="11250291">I -- I say, for those two reasons, basically, we can distinguish On Lee away because of the fact that there wasn't right of -- again, this was close to the time of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.997" offset="11303372">With -- with our case, it's a year and half after and a year and a half after I passed wherein they were dealing with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.332" offset="11332733">Again, Your Honor, I'm glad you brought the On Lee because the postscript to the On Lee case and then finally, I think almost bares this out, because On Lee later move for a new trial and the -- and in his motion for new trial, it was based on an affidavit stating that the informant, the so-called "informant" came in and he -- his affidavit said, "I lied."</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.090" offset="11435760">That conversation never took place in On Lee's Laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.671" offset="11450075">This was the so-called "informant", which these informants are unreliable persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.552" offset="11473586">Secondly, in addition, On Lee said this that the agent for the Government, who heard the conversation and testified, was recently dismissed for improper activity, particularly the type in -- in concern with On Lee, where he obtained evidence that never actually happened on some of these argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.341" offset="11552684">So I point out that this is an example how unreliable this evidence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.372" offset="11576822">There were references also to -- to Justice Potter Stewart's answer about -- question about the reliability of Murphy's recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.118" offset="11607855">Murphy was not free from motivation, as my adversary would have you believe in his self-serving declarations about the reliability of -- of government agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.213" offset="11652263">You and I know that they're human too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.195" offset="11660204">They could make mistakes and they could be unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.822" offset="11670653">In On Lee, they were unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.050" offset="11679535">And in addition, picture for yourself, the idea of this -- Finbarr Murphy was a big, tall Irish fellow who had -- had the earphones and he's sitting up in Harlem, listening to this conversation and -- and it's late at night and he's still engaged in this dirty business and he's sitting for three hours and he doesn't want anyone to know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.998" offset="11775352">I'm sure, he must have been under some strain to recollect what was going on and I'm sure he must have had to relay on it and that this strain could have helped his motive to -- to had full of supply but be mistaken and -- and he would have -- in that case, the mistakes would be to our detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.989" offset="11855287">Again, one further point with reference to the Lopez dissent, Colson's character was never, and as I said, put an issue because he never testified and -- and there was a big difference between Colson, a convicted convict, and a man who sort of lived by the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.500" offset="11921324">And Massiah, who was a sailor, never charged or -- or arrested at the end of his life and never in trouble working as a -- as a seaman on his ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.757" offset="11962389">I -- I submit that this -- this was a very important fact by Colson not being on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.908" offset="11987048">If Massiah was to be accused, he should be confronted with his accuser, not someone standing about a -- half a block away and listening to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.643" offset="12033964">With reference to -- oh, with reference to the persuasion aspect of it, sometimes its argued by my adversary that, well, coercion while I pointed out, we don't know whether there was any coercion in the situation because On Lee was -- didn't -- I mean because Colson didn't testify and we cannot go by -- by Murphy's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.708" offset="12130200">And -- and the fact that this was done in a stealthy manner also brings to mind that John Gay, which was quoted by, I think the Chief Justice that “an open foe may prove a curse but a pretended friend is worse.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.432" offset="12189132">And that's what Mr. Jesse Colson was, a pretended friend in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.876" offset="12214836">Further points and with reference to the law on this case, are the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.313" offset="12244616">These are not as strong as the others I would say but I believe they are in the spirit of the other objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.537" offset="12269484">Now, the Fourth Amendment, the illegal search and seizures, I believe, the Lopez dissent by Mr. Justice Brennan eloquently places this in focus and states how the -- the Government can obtain one way the -- this evidence in violation of the person's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.583" offset="12361749">I've pointed out that -- suppose in this situation that Massiah and Colson had -- had -- of claiming their defense or claim defense had -- had stated our whole defense in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.914" offset="12415039">Well, the Government would in that -- in that event probably never used the tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.937" offset="12431130">They could put the tape in a drawer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.736" offset="12438340">They would know my whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.993" offset="12443355">They wouldn't have to come into my office and -- and steal my records but they're doing in a more subtle and sophisticated way what they -- what they cannot do by virtue of the -- the words of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.265" offset="12496436">The Fourth Amendment is related to the Fifth Amendment as -- as Justice Black has -- as Mr. Justice Black has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.240" offset="12532381">With the right of privacy, our argument, the Olmstead case, Justice Brandeis' opinion I think sets forth the law on the right of privacy and eloquently describes it better than I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.641" offset="12589955">I -- I used the right of privacy in -- in a large portions of the -- of the Brandeis decision in my brief before the U.S. Court of Appeals but I believe just mention of it would be sufficient in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.255" offset="12644394">My adversary states on that there was no invasion, intrusion or trespass on -- on the right of privacy of Winston Massiah.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.070" offset="12679607">I submit that he chose the words and I submit that there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.951" offset="12695176">And he uses these verbs "invasion, intrusion and trespass" and the origin of these words are generally Latin in body to go into, intruderate, to thrust into, trespass, transpass, to cross over, cross of boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.638" offset="12761945">Now, I say the Government went into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.096" offset="12775737">The -- the Government argues in their brief they had every right to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.720" offset="12790262">But if they had every right to be there, so the Massiah's counsel has every right to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.409" offset="12808965">But Massiah's counsel, they knew who Massiah's counsel was and -- and they never chose to notify in such a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.007" offset="12839372">In addition, the -- they never denied, never under any circumstance, that Colson was a government agent acting in the employ of the Government so the principle of qui facit per alium facit per se is employer -- employable and that he -- that he was acting in furtherance of his master's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.546" offset="12929546">Intrusion, thrust into, they thrust that recorder under the seat of the -- of Colson's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.029" offset="12963506">I point that this, we, as human beings, have -- have a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3237.693" offset="13054098">They crossed over our boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.464" offset="13061204">They crossed over the boundary of this man's intangible but his rights -- his rights, as you might say, are privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.280" offset="13092446">These rights are as intangible as my right to good reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.818" offset="13114598">Where is the border?</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.929" offset="13119091">You can't find out where the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.370" offset="13124838">It's an intangible thing but it's a trespass on my person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.678" offset="13138108">And when someone does such a thing, we have illegal remedies for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.569" offset="13157648">With reference to the freedom of speech, well, as I pointed out that we would be seriously afraid to express ourselves if we had these recordings fall over where they would be taking our conversations down and using willy-nilly, often the argument is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.170" offset="13256077">Well, if you're not talking evil, why -- what do you care whether your conversation is being taped by the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.803" offset="13286588">Well, suffice it to say, I care and suffice it to say, I think the judges care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.098" offset="13311770">The point being this, that there are many conversations that may not be evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.938" offset="13335176">However, these conversations are confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.616" offset="13349804">The conversations that the judges -- that the judges have between yourselves now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.258" offset="13368404">These are confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.228" offset="13372270">They're not evil but you would like them private.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.420" offset="13381047">Your conversations in chambers, a conversation that the bench might have with the bar asking them to hold a certain item confidentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.712" offset="13414170">Many, many confidential conversations are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.639" offset="13429948">If we seriously restrict the -- seriously restrict the right of free speech then we will be living to or well in 1984 and the Telscreen would be the icon of the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.538" offset="13493478">With reference to the summation and conclusion of what all this point say, the summation and conclusion of what all this point say is that this -- this case and the points involved are really a question of the spirit of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.228" offset="13556276">And the spirit of the Fifth Amendment, as I think Justice Potter Stewart used the term, is to avoid midnight inquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.371" offset="13584906">This wasn't midnight but this was about 11 o'clock in the street in Harlem where the -- the defendant didn't have his counsel present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.329" offset="13612701">A dispute of the Fifth Amendment is that if the Government has something and the prosecutor has something let them come forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.170" offset="13640077">I don't have to come forward it -- with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.443" offset="13649168">So the Fifth Amendment says you don't have to incriminate yourself vocally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.147" offset="13667976">The Fourth Amendment says you -- they can't take your records from your desks and incriminate you with your records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.150" offset="13692008">The Sixth Amendment says that not only you as your right of counsel as your -- as your rights in self-incrimination protected and stated but is protected by your right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.622" offset="13733909">The Canon 9 is a -- is a structure put upon the -- the attorney's voluntarily sue that they will obey the tenets and the spirit of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.770" offset="13786467">With reference Rule 93, I pointed that again the Fifth Amendment deals with basic fundamental fairness and it's a fair rule and I think that's the -- the capsule description of the Rule 93.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.609" offset="13853759">With reference to the right of privacy, the right of privacy and the freedom of speech, again, this spirit prevails and the spirit that the Government having something to accuse us of will come forward within.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.184" offset="13928155">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3463.388" offset="13956890">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.946" offset="13983117">This is a case which has been troublesome, worrisome from the standpoint of the Government, no less than I suspected maybe the standpoint of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.854" offset="14034840">It's also a case in which it seems to me that it is essential to be very exact and precise both about the facts, especially those which distinguish it from loosely similar situations and about the doctrines with which we are concerned because while these general principles that are invoked or of inestimable importance to human liberty, it is also true that some of the practices involved are indispensable to the investigation of organized crime and it behooves, therefore, I think to use very exact and precise and so far as possible dispassionate weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.838" offset="14246745">Here, it seems to us that there are three questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.730" offset="14274330">The first concerns the use of the Schmidt transmitter and receiver and the recorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.777" offset="14306513">We urge that where the truth of conflicting accounts of a voluntary conversation maybe an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.423" offset="14341099">The use of a recorder or a transmitter and receiver to verify the conversation with the permission of one party and without any form of trespass is a lawful method of getting at the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.274" offset="14404420">And that introduction of the fruits of their use in evidence, not only violates the right of the defendant but on the contrary, it helps to advance the fundamental purpose of the trial which is to bring out the truth of the charges and have been a conflicting testimony on one side or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.045" offset="14491564">The second question here concerns the absence of Colson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.622" offset="14513821">I say "absence", I should have said more accurately the unavailability of Colson's testimony because he was not absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.336" offset="14544750">We submit that his unavailability does not render Murphy's testimony inadmissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3655.829" offset="14726666">There was a scene in which he expressed terror and refused to go on and testify, spoke of threats, so much so that the judge at the request of the other defendants declared a mistrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3682.005" offset="14831365">And again, he explained that he wouldn't testify that he'd been threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.169" offset="14852054">Judge Skelly Wright who presided here sought to separate out whether the threats induced his plea of guilty and upon being satisfied that they did not, he accepted the plea of guilty and later, Colson was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.546" offset="14921540">It's his unwillingness to testify that I referred to when I spoke of the unavailability of his testimony or whether it could have been received buying a -- sanctions enough, I doubt it but he was not pressed farther then the judge and the prosecutor is being satisfied that he was in fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.540" offset="15009520">And the question comes up, which is perhaps somewhat closer than the first question I raised, whether his unavailability makes the evidence given by Murphy concerning what he overheard inadmissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3838.714" offset="15458200">The third point which needs to be considered and which introduces, in my judgment, the both source for misgivings about the case is that this happened after Massiah had been indicted while this has been said, he had counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3972.058" offset="15991620">In On Lee, he was out on bail pending trial and so was Massiah so those facts are the same here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.356" offset="16020773">Again, as I say the record shows that On Lee has a lawyer but no attention was directed to that in the opinion and to -- to the extent that that is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.804" offset="16062568">There is a possible ground for distinction in the way the Court treated it, although not on the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.787" offset="16090572">Now, there are, in addition, two differences, which I submit make this an easier case for affirmance than On Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.524" offset="16121501">In the first place, the conversation took place there in On Lee's store.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.186" offset="16144071">There was room for an argument that the informer carrying the transmitter was trespassing because he was not authorized to come in with the transmitter and that you will recall is the ground that Mr. Justice Burton joined by Mr. Justice Frankfurter urged in defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.988" offset="16227349">There's no conceivable basis for any such argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.072" offset="16247620">This conversation took place in Colson's car, the informer's car, on a public street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.069" offset="16279698">Colson had agreed that both the recorder and the transmitter might be installed in the car and indeed, the car had been used and continued or had been used for sometime in carrying on the investigation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.833" offset="16342706">This was not just one conversation or even a conversation with just one man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.546" offset="16361514">This particular one was with one man but there had been other conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.309" offset="16376560">This was a car that eventually been turned over to the Government by Colson for use in carrying on the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.738" offset="16406340">So on that ground, On Lee is certainly distinguishable in a manner favorable to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="4207.694" offset="16934118">The other difference that I wanted to stress, that is in our favor, is that in On Lee, there was no effort to produce the undercover agent Chin Poy and his whereabouts were not disclosed by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.756" offset="17010395">Here, we attempted first to make our case on Colson's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.352" offset="17028786">It was to our desire and our interest to have Colson testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.295" offset="17048534">But because of the incidents I've mentioned, it was concluded that that testimony was not -- not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.566" offset="17081657">Consequently, except for some possible room for argument introduced by the point of our counsel, the application of On Lee to this case clearly would call for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.021" offset="17139440">Second, I think I should emphasize in speaking about the established precedent, that the Court thus far has always refused to apply the Fourth Amendment unless there were some intrusion into the premises or some interference with the person or has involved some legal compulsion to produce documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.157" offset="17228048">Thus far in cases in this general area, some physical intrusions, some physical invasion has been required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.820" offset="17266604">Now, plainly, there was, as I pointed out before, no physical invasion in any sense of any premises or property of the -- of the defendant Massiah here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.582" offset="17325746">Even if, even if the doctrine of the Fourth Amendment were extended to cover the kind of intrusion that was involved in Goldman, still, that would not cover this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.808" offset="17386559">In Goldman, you will recall by the use of a device on the wall of the room unconsented to by anyone, for anyone inside the room at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.832" offset="17426683">The Government might be said, by modern scientific devices, to have intruded its senses into the room without the consent of the people who have the processionary or property interest in the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.853" offset="17482794">Again, there is no intrusion of that kind into the car because this was consented to by the informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.884" offset="17518947">So I think that under established doctrine, it's also fair to say that there is no violation of any Fourth Amendment right and that even in extension of those rights to a case like Goldman would avail this petition or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="4667.097" offset="18771780">I do come now to the use of the recorder and the Schmidt transmitter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.908" offset="18794977">And we submit that their use neither violated any rights under the Fourth Amendment nor was otherwise unlawful or so overreaching or overbearing leaving aside the element that Justice Stewart just mentioned as to call for suppression of the evidence received.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.420" offset="18885047">The permissibility of making a record that will verify and in the sense of being more complete record supplement, the testimony of a live witness would seem to be firmly established by the decision last term in Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.185" offset="18960071">No one has a right of privacy or another legally protected interest in not having repeated the words he utters to another person, on the contrary, is subject to some special privilege like husband and wife or lawyer and client.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.434" offset="19037080">Indeed, I supposed it's fair to say that given some indication that it's pertinent to a criminal trial or a civil proceeding, the person now hears the word has a legal duty to testify to what he heard, absent this kind of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.367" offset="19104789">Now, what the recording and transmission and reception with the consent of one participant do is simply to verify the oral account.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.736" offset="19154317">It breaches, no, there is no breach of privacy that would otherwise be inviolate when you add the recording or the use of the transmitter and receiver, where one of the parties consents and is prepared to repeat what he heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.264" offset="19236446">I think we should distinguish very sharply between this case and the case like Lopez on the one side and the kind of electronic eavesdropping that is illustrated by Goldman and perhaps by the Olmstead case on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.225" offset="19308231">All things, electronic, are not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.513" offset="19321396">And there some be a -- a distinction, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.875" offset="19338846">In Goldman, as I indicated earlier, the investigators projected their senses into a room which they had no right to enter and the entry into which would rather plainly have violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.568" offset="19401644">Arguably, that was true in On Lee, two justices took that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.936" offset="19427140">In Goldman, and certainly in Olmstead, there was another form of intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.777" offset="19458487">The federal investigators intruded into a private conversation without the consent of any participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.643" offset="19497984">It was -- they had no consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.136" offset="19507911">There was no one there who was going to repeat it but they, I say intruded, they thrust themselves in from the outside and thus destroyed what, otherwise, would have been a private conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.359" offset="19568828">Neither of those elements was present in Lopez and neither is present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.457" offset="19601220">There was no intrusion into a private place or property of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.578" offset="19617729">There was no search of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.229" offset="19628283">There was no legal compulsion to make any statements or to give the Government any evidence to assume therefore that Olmstead and Goldman were both bad law and that the Fourth Amendment gives protection against electronic intrusion into private premises, is of no avail to this petitioner as I said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.531" offset="19729533">Nor there was -- nor was there any unconsented to intrusion into the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.173" offset="19756074">All the recording did was to get the most reliable evidence of a conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.850" offset="19778748">That was by -- by definition, no longer private.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.178" offset="19800064">And I would emphasize that this distinction between Lopez and the present case on the one side and cases like Goldman and Olmstead on the other, is one that is widely recognized by the commentators in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.572" offset="19861608">Samuel Dash and his co-authors in the book on the eavesdroppers that is often referred to and probably the most complete study of this subject is -- referring to his previous discussion which was along the lines that I have fallen, the above analysis would appear to justify the conclusion that eavesdropping, and he means electronic eavesdropping, violates a substantial interest of the defendant only where it is not consented to by either party to the conversation or where the conversation is within confidential relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.301" offset="20000580">Edward Bennett Williams, in the article cited by Mr. Justice Brennan in his dissent in Lopez, discusses the problem and he too reaches the conclusion that there's no greater intrusion into privacy that is of legal significance in using a transmitter and recorder -- a transmitter and receiver or recorder, then there is in having one participant to the conversation related.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.586" offset="20121684">The only real distinction is that a simultaneous record or broadcast is more complete and exact than any subsequent report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.471" offset="20153240">This is a distinction in degree but not in essence, where a conversation is recorded or transmitted without the consent of any participant, that's not our case, that's Goldman, an entirely different set of concepts must apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.921" offset="20215097">This is the view that Allan Westin takes in his article on wiretapping and Bradley and Hogan in an article in the Georgetown Law Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.347" offset="20248743">It's a view adapted in five of the seven states statutes that have legislated on the subject of electronic devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.551" offset="20285628">So that we submit that it has respectable authority among those who have been most sensitive to this problem of the protection of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.864" offset="20346859">I come now to the plight, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.269" offset="20364413">What significance should we attribute to the fact that Colson did not testify, because that is the next element in the case and it's one as we're all aware that you directed attention to in your separate opinion in Lopez?</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.514" offset="20429406">I would like to suggest the first that this question of whether the informer must be present and testify, is purely a matter of the materiality and reliability of the evidence and perhaps, in some cases, of fairness in allocating the duty of producing witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.671" offset="20514043">What I mean is this, there -- it's not a Fourth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.842" offset="20534732">The Fourth Amendment either was violated or not violated at the time the recording was made in the simultaneous transmission and reception occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.333" offset="20580707">And if, as I submit I have shown and the Court should hold, it was not a violation then causing subsequent failure to testify can hardly make it a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.098" offset="20627728">Equally, there's no other illegality if it was proper when done that would call for some kind of a prophylactic rule which would prevent the use of the evidence in order to prevent the conduct because the conduct was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.326" offset="20704632">We face it as a problem of evidence in and in some cases it's a matter of fairness in allocating the right of calling witnesses and putting them to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.160" offset="20751966">Now, by all normal standards of the law of evidence, the recording or the agent's report of what he heard is material enough and reliable enough to be received in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.701" offset="20814137">Any disproof, explanation or impeachments, if it's a live witness, are for the defendant to come forward with by all normal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.539" offset="20857501">One start, I suppose, with the obvious proposition that admissions are receivable in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.829" offset="20890728">Obviously, these admissions would be receivable in evidence if overheard by Murphy with his own ears.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.981" offset="20923329">And they would be receivable in evidence if he had heard only what he testified to hear and couldn't testify to any other part of the conversation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6594.955" offset="26483231">I would like -- I was going to state in -- that the other factor I suppose that enters into here on the side of petitioner is that somehow our sense of the necessity of fairness is heightened and enhanced after the man has been indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6612.392" offset="26552926">Now, for the arguments against that view and for admission of the evidence, in the first place, certainly not everything is the defendant's life after indictment is part of the criminal proceeding against him where he's out on bail and free to come and go as he pleases even though it uses evidence -- yields evidence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6635.223" offset="26644250">He's not in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="6637.165" offset="26651982">There is no official pressure to answer questions, and that, as I say, it seems to me to be the center of the view of the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6648.227" offset="26696286">Again, certainly, indictment does not put an end to the need to carry on an investigation into elicit activities in narcotics and other organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6661.149" offset="26748008">It's particularly important that the investigation go on even after a single defendant has been indicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="6691.872" offset="26870888">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6695.112" offset="26883845">Before the luncheon recess, I was addressing myself to the final segment of the case, the question whether this incident in the car, the conversation in the car and the surrounding circumstances should be thought of as part of the proceedings against the defendant so as to bring in and apply the right to counsel and the privilege against self-incrimination or whether they should be thought how this something outside and separate in which event the evidence under normal rules would be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6729.925" offset="27023026">I'd stated two -- two of the reasons that lead us to the conclusion that on the whole, they should be regarded as separate and the evidence should be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.104" offset="27075793">In the first place, we emphasize that the defendant was not in custody, that there were no official questioning, no pressure of any kind either to stay there or to engage in the conversation or answer questions nor could it be said in any sense to be an interrogation by an expert interrogator.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.274" offset="27160430">The second point that I had just began to develop was that the return of an indictment against one member of what maybe a conspiracy in the case of organized crime doesn't terminate the need to press forward the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6784.514" offset="27241409">We're not dealing here, and I think it's important to bear this in mind, where the single crime of violence, say a murder at a filing station, bludgeoning in a bar, somebody kills his wife or something like that, that's the case which has frequently come before the Court and there any questioning of whether under -- in the police station or otherwise is obviously addressed to extracting evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.630" offset="27349870">That is not typically true in the kind of case that we're dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="6817.440" offset="27373171">There is the rest of the ring to be uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.080" offset="27387695">Indeed here Aiken, the bake man was identified and found after this took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.062" offset="27415594">Frequently the defendant himself, while allowed to on bail, resumes or continuous his criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.131" offset="27443911">I'm not saying Massiah did, I'm simply saying that frequently is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.146" offset="27467943">Pursuing the investigation in the manner done here, in other words, is not necessarily or even primarily focused upon obtaining an evidence against the particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6857.277" offset="27532518">But the third point I would stress is that the return of an indictment or if you will the date of arraignment or any other arbitrary date is not a very satisfactory cutoff point in which to say admissions before that are admissible and the admissions afterwards are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.768" offset="27618408">If a cutoff point is indispensable, I suppose this one is good as any.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.200" offset="27636172">But it's pretty hard really to distinguish Massiah's situation before he was indicted from Massiah's situation after he was indicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="6991.303" offset="28068551">Indeed, it's interesting that the petitioner states the question, our defendant's incriminating statements made in the absence of his retained counsel after formal -- after the formal proceeding has been initiated by his arraignment and indictment admissible over objection in a federal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7011.425" offset="28149112">Well, certainly, if he had voluntarily told some other person, his wife that she was willing -- what she might have been his brother.</text>

            <text syncTime="7096.171" offset="28488077">It's a little harder because here, in a sense he was talking to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="7100.816" offset="28506676">There was a transmitter recorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="7104.452" offset="28521200">I doubt that that should matter from anything overheard in any other fashion on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="7110.964" offset="28547218">It's a little different too because the agent had -- was cooperating with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="7118.293" offset="28576580">But I shouldn't take this was material where the informer is simply a layman, someone who is inside the ring and he's reporting what goes on, I would distinguish it very sharply from a case of where the prosecutor himself saying in some kind of disguise, was drawing out the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7143.624" offset="28677831">It seems to me to go to the points you raised before the recess, Mr. Justice Stewart, the point is in the dissenting opinion that this isn't likely to be or fairly thought of as a problem of the expert on one side questioning the innocent man and the other and I think that's another difference from what I understand to be the true theory of the New York cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.853" offset="28786813">Here, this is very similar to the situation that might develop if the Government were investigating an espionage ring and somebody had been infiltrated into the ring of one man is indicted that is released on -- on bail.</text>

            <text syncTime="7299.543" offset="29301530">The other way I think might be to make an inquiry into what really is it that the Government is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7307.604" offset="29333817">And I -- I have difficulty with the first view that you were suggesting should be considered because if you -- if the Government is doing something lawful and proper, then it would seem to me that the universally accepted test becomes simply is this reliable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7332.259" offset="29432456">And I don't think that I need to argue that by the normal standards, this is reliable probative evidence subject to such exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="7342.440" offset="29473102">And I think the other way of coming at it may be to say, like all of these lines, it's not a perfect one, but maybe to say, what is it that the Government is primarily trying to do if it is gathering evidence against this man if that's the center of what it is doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="7363.544" offset="29557530">Then it ought to be treated under the rule of the New York cases, whereas if the Government is proceeding in normal fashion to, as it had been before, to carry on an investigation, then if this testimony falls into its lap, that isn't quite a fair statement because it obviously knows it may fall into its lap.</text>

            <text syncTime="7546.598" offset="30289795">I would think this case still should be affirmed because all those opinions, as I understand it, are directed to an interrogation by -- if -- of a man who if not in custody is certainly in custody in a loose sense is -- and -- is being quizzed for the purpose in Spano simply of getting evidence against him, there was no further investigation because that was a crime of violence by experts was an inquisition.</text>

            <text syncTime="7785.984" offset="31247339">Second, if I might just answer, Justice Goldberg, a second thing that would seem to me to be of enormous importance is who is doing it?</text>
            <text syncTime="7795.289" offset="31284537">And this, of course, in terms of the Canon of Ethics, it's extremely important</text>
            <text syncTime="7800.643" offset="31305958">Another -- another factor, I would say of somewhat less important, was whether this is an interrogation or whether it is simply overhearing a pre-conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7816.124" offset="31367920">And as I've suggested before, it would seem to me that it should also be taken into account, judging it from the circumstances as one best can, whether this is part of an investigation or whether this is something centered on parroting information out against this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="7839.328" offset="31460707">It's -- it's that kind of thing that I would address myself to in seeking to ascertain whether this is fairly to be thought of as normal investigation of crime or whether it's really adding to the rest of a criminal proceeding, something like the French interrogation before the judge give instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7866.266" offset="31568436">And I would think that this case was on the safe side that wherever the line is to be drawn, it's to be drawn much closer to formal interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7879.010" offset="31619427">The case in the house that you put obviously would give me more -- more trouble.</text>
