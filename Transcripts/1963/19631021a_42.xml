            <text syncTime="29.835" offset="222751">This case involves the construction of subsections 1 and 2 of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that those sections are set forth in Pages 2 and 3 of our brief and state that it shall be unlawful for any investment advisor by the jurisdictional means, one to employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud any client or a perspective client or two, to engage in any transaction practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or perspective client.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.619" offset="441866">The commission contends that this section is violated when an investment advisor who recommends a security to a large number of paying subscribers follows a practice of trading on the market effect of his advice without disclosing to his clients that he doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.954" offset="563179">What he did here, the pattern of his activity, was to purchase particular securities then recommend these securities for a long-term gain and then sell on the market rise that followed his recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.874" offset="638830">The Court below in a five to four en banc opinion affirmed the District Judge and holding that this was not a fraud within the meaning of the sections that I have just read to you.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.041" offset="887515">We think that this would not necessarily in all circumstances be fraudulent.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.644" offset="4009984">Let me give you some illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.753" offset="4022418">I think that we all agree and certainly the Court below did that in the type of case which that you have in Ridgely against Keene situation where a man is paid to give certain advice even though it's his best advice, I mean he says it was honest advice I would have give it in anyway, I think we all agree that that's fraudulent because of the possible conflict, what's he going to do the next time, is he going to look around for a stock that maybe somebody will pay him to recommend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.943" offset="4119176">Similarly here suppose the man purchases his stock, in this case, and one of them the United Fruit transaction he put in a $117,000 of his money buying the security and then he recommended it a few days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.887" offset="4182915">Now suppose during those few days he heard something that indicated that the earnings were going to fall of the United Fruit, suppose he played golf with the competitor and the competitor told him something about that we have new invention that's going to put these people out of business then what does he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.279" offset="4264521">Does he still let his recommendation go out or does he hold it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.772" offset="4286464">Now maybe, maybe he is sufficiently honest, but he won't send out the recommendation, but shouldn't the person who is paying for the service knows that – know that he follows that practice, and further more he might have the situation where he, as I said, he generally recommended one stock each month, there might have been three or four stocks that all looked pretty good for a long-term gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.057" offset="4375594">And in determining which one he would recommend, he decided to take the one that was more volatile that had – that would probably lend itself more to scalp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.939" offset="4427107">Now this maybe even an unconscious choice on his part, but if he is doing that, if his own interests might be different from those of his clients, it is our position that this is a conflict of interest which must be disclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.549" offset="5221543">It is not disputed that about once a month these recommendations were made to purchase a security for long-term gain to 5000 paid subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.454" offset="5277236">Now they point out that they dispute to how many other people this recommendation went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.631" offset="5317883">There was another service that they supply and sometimes the recommendation went out to the 20,000 subscribers to that service and sometimes even more people, but they point out that in those situations it is argued we give our subscribers to this service a chance to buy first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.222" offset="5396250">In another words, they hold up the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.979" offset="5407326">The recommendations here are set forth in the record, following Page 34 and at the bottom of the page the print came out so light and so tiny that it might be well to read to you the language at the bottom of 34 which is the respondent's own characterization of this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.305" offset="5516622">An investment service devoted exclusively to one the protection of investment capital, two the realization of a steady and attractive income there from, and three the accumulation of capital gains through the timely purchase of corporate equities that are proved to be undervalued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.673" offset="5606066">And it is our position that this is not devoted exclusively to these matters when the service is also used to provide a basis for the scalping activities, the trading activities of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.404" offset="5684955">The charts dealing with the -- what did happen in a market each time are set forth at Pages 15 of the record and thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.007" offset="5735424">And it will be noticed that the you could almost pick what is the mailing date of the report even if it weren't written on each of these because on every occasion the volume increased greatly generally two, three, or four times that's what it did and in each case except where a security was disparaged and price went down, the price rose to several points usually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.392" offset="5860916">For example in the United Fruit case which is on Page 15, the closing for the week or two before had ranged from 21 and an 8 to 22 and three 8s and then the week following the close got to 25 and a 8 and then began slowly to get down following the mailing the date the report and this was the security in which a $117,000 was invested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.416" offset="5969063">I mean these were just tiny sums this man was putting in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.146" offset="5995917">In addition as I think I made clear on one occasion where this Chock Full O'Nuts where the security was disparaged instead of buying in advance, he sold short and covered subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.128" offset="6059865">We have a chart on our brief, at Pages 6 and 7 which indicate the purchase price and the dates recommended and the selling price and profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.553" offset="6109602">Respondents do not dispute the accuracy of this chart except as to the profit figures in one or -- in several of the instances and these are generally because they either have additional transactions or in one situation it's Chock Full O'Nuts where they bought puts that is options to sell, they apparently did not sell quickly enough, but held them until the market had come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.719" offset="6250245">The fact that an investment advisor is in a confidential relationship with the persons he advises was conceded by the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.160" offset="6304057">The cases in the matter of -- seen in the lower Courts, all seem to hold this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.140" offset="6327881">The legislative history of the act shows that the purpose of the legislation was to remove conflicts of interests between the investment counsel and the clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.549" offset="6381589">The respondents say only one thing and that is their advice and it's our view that anything which interferes with the disinterestedness of that advice must be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.903" offset="6499035">The -- certain of the other acts have in addition to these two provisions, an additional provision with respect to permissions to state, it is our position, however, that in circumstances not dissimilar from this the Courts have generally held that the violation was not only of that provision but also of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.473" offset="6597256">Presumably and there is a nothing we could find in the legislative history that explains it that presumably advisors particularly many who get out of list of best buys and so forth were concerned that they would have to get a – in effect a prospectus out on every security that they were recommending whereas many of their clients merely wanted to know good buys and bad buys or good to sell and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.531" offset="6721494">I would like to and I think that that is the basic reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.896" offset="6738944">I should say also, however, that this Court in the Joiner case did make the point that the expressio unius doctrine does not apply to the, at least the provisions of the Securities Act there involved, that the Court will treat the statute in accordance with the way it was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.729" offset="6846255">Also as Judge Clarke pointed out in his dissenting opinion those sections are tied to obtain money or property without disclosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.086" offset="6899754">Now these people, expect for the $18 subscription service, are not obtaining money or property in the sense of selling them stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.911" offset="6934967">The real evil via statute was aimed at I believe was primarily not to have people waste their funds in securities that are recommended which are not upon the basis of the best recommendation of the advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.019" offset="7015424">And in that connection I would like to point out that while it is argued in my opponent's brief that these people had the opportunity to profit and that chart is shown based on post record prices what there is – is in this chart is merely the subsequent high that there ever was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.434" offset="7093060">For example they point out in the United Fruit case that it could have been still bought at twenty two-and-three quarters and sold at thirty-and-a-half, but after the six months had lapsed for which the recommendation was made, the price was around 15 and 17, in other words, a loss of around 35%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.719" offset="7170278">What they are saying is, that if somebody sold at the top of the market the subsequent market from that day till this there might have been a profit, but they never told them when to sell, they don't claim that they said so at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.875" offset="7222836">They might also have sold at the low of the subsequent market, and they would not be necessarily well off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.563" offset="8149661">Mr. Justice Warren, Justices of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.573" offset="8165648">This case started in November 1960 on an application for a preliminary injunction and no effort has ever been made to try the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.774" offset="8234506">The District Court found that there was no fraud and no intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.164" offset="8272018">It is undisputed that the recommendations that the investment advisor made were sound and indeed in the instances complained of anyone who had followed his advice for long-term gain has the opportunity to profit from 34% to 84%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.424" offset="8397093">Now what is complained of is that after the investment advisor had investigated a stock and had decided to recommend it to customers, he himself before he sent out his recommendation bought some shares and in the six instances complained of, they are small shares compared to the outstanding stock of the company is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.270" offset="8540453">One company Creole has an issue of 77 million shares, the man bought 600.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.310" offset="8592593">Nowhere do they claim that his advice was not good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.563" offset="8625612">Now assuming that he had bought no shares, would it not be equally argued by the commission that here is an advisor who recommends stock and does not follow his own advice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.406" offset="8708995">And suppose of buying 600 shares, suppose he bought one is there a conflict of interest created?</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.576" offset="8753716">Is the integrity of his advice changed?</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.844" offset="8778794">The real test is whether this man was honest and was giving his subscribers the opportunity to purchase for a long-term gain which on the facts proved to be 100% correct.</text>
