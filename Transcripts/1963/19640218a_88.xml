            <text syncTime="64.289" offset="360573">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.973" offset="375306">This is one of two cases that are here on certiorari to review judgments of the two courts of appeals involving the application of the recent amendments of-- to the National Labor Relations Act to Union concerted activities at retail stores independently on selling the goods of an employer produced by an employer who has been engaged and is engaged in a labor dispute with the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.298" offset="504560">In the instant case, the question is whether it is an unfair labor practice for the Union to picket the retail store with signs asking consumers not to purchase a product made by another employer, in this case several hundred miles away, with whom the Union had a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.911" offset="595048">In the case next to be argued, the Servette case, the question is whether the Union may request the manager of one of the retail stores not to purchase from the primary employer, as we call him, the one with whom it has the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.501" offset="661400">And, second, if it refuses, whether the Union may pass out hand bills, otherwise, without picketing, request the consumers not to purchase those products.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.486" offset="721272">We say that the case involving picketing does involve an unfair labor practice and that the case involving the request directed to the managers of the store and to the passing out hand bills and other forms of publicity does not involve an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.832" offset="794728">That rather nice distinction results, we contend, from the language of the statute and is not one simply-- and this one made by Congress rather than one to be made independently.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.888" offset="1326895">And, therefore, we are not under the ne -- as I understand it, therefore, we are not under the necessity of dealing with some of these nice borderline cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.821" offset="1370676">I think the short time that I have this afternoon could be best spent if I said just a few words about the evolution of the statutory provision involved in these two cases, and I'll recall the particular practice of this case again tomorrow morning when we come to deal with it precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.140" offset="1447894">And, I think you'll find it most convenient, in both these cases, to refer to a very slim gray document numbers 88 and 111, which we have distributed as a comparative print of the Taft-Hartley version of this section, comparing it with the set of the provisions added in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.412" offset="1561057">The parts of Section 8 (b)(4) that we're concerned with have always dealt with secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.898" offset="1598986">That is to say, with Union activities in which there are two employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.673" offset="1618108">The so-called primary employer with whom the Union has its dispute, here, the packer of these apples, and a secondary employer, a neutral employer in the sense that he has no interest in the dispute who may be distributing the goods, as here, or may have some other connection, maybe a supplier of the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.072" offset="1711626">He is usually called the secondary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.357" offset="1724792">In our print, the Taft-Hartley version is set forth in roman type and you'll notice the gist of those parts that we're concerned with “where making it an unfair labor practice for a Union to induce,” on page 2, “or encourage the employees of any employer,” and then, we skip the italics, “to engage in certain kinds of conduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="432.588" offset="1833775">And, this is important in the Servette case, “to engage in a strike or a concerted refusal, in the course of their employment, to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise, work on or handle any goods or s -- materials or to perform any services that deals with refusals to render employment services.”</text>
            <text syncTime="455.767" offset="1926457">And then, skipping to B -- skipping down to the -- “where an object thereof is,” skipping over to B, “forcing or requiring any other -- any employer or other person to cease dealing with the primary employer,” so that you always have two employers in these situations, “and you had, necessarily, always an inducement to employees to strike or otherwise withhold employment services.”</text>
            <text syncTime="487.646" offset="2053935">And there were two a -- two criticisms, one primary criticism of the limitations on this section, and I want to mention there were others but only one that need to be mentioned now.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.877" offset="2106911">One of the complaints was that the requirement of inducing or encouraging the employees to engage in a strike against the secondary employee meant that the Union could go to the secondary employer and say “we will call a strike of your employees or we will do various other things causing trouble for you,” and that wouldn't be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.693" offset="2206177">The unfair labor practice wouldn't come about until there was some inducement of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.182" offset="2232090">That had two consequences that the critics complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.063" offset="2251630">One was that it meant, because of the delays in the administrative and judicial process, that the secondary employer would suffer some harm before he ever could get any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.281" offset="2296456">It also meant, in terms of the interest of the primary employer, that the secondary employer, not having much interest in this, threatened with trouble, the full impact of which he knew nothing about, it might be serious, it might be trivial.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.056" offset="2351626">The easy thing for him to do, often, would be to cutoff dealing with the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.332" offset="2372733">And, both those things, the critics from one side, under the Taft-Hartley Act, said we're undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.519" offset="2409409">And, their solution was to put in the language that now appears on page 2 in italics, after a little roman two, “so as to make it an unfair labor practice for the labor organization for little two to threatened, coerce, or restrain any person,” and that refers to the secondary employer, as a matter of grammar if you read it all the way through, “for the purpose of making him cease selling the goods of the primary employer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="609.743" offset="2542320">The word “objection” is raised to that also.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.800" offset="2554546">That was the proposal of the Eisenhower Administration and Senator McClellan and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.813" offset="2578578">One objection that was raised recalled the experience of labor unions in going to secondary employers, and it's saying to them, “look, this shop that we have a dispute with is run by racketeers or pays such low wages that it's a disgrace to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.359" offset="2656841">We want you to stop dealing with it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="641.994" offset="2671365">No threat, no coercion, just a plain request.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.549" offset="2685576">One of the big strikes in the clothing industry in 1929 that Senator Kennedy and others recall during the debate was settled when a Chicago retailer went to his supplier of clothing and said “if you don't settle this strike with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers -- settle this dispute with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers without a strike, I'm going to take away $1 million of business annually.”</text>
            <text syncTime="671.455" offset="2789230">He wasn't yielding to a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.149" offset="2795917">He wasn't coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.508" offset="2801455">He was persuaded that it was a good thing for the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.312" offset="2816606">And, one of the objections to the language about threaten, coerce, and restrain was that it might stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.858" offset="2846804">The response was that it wouldn't, and the critics, on that point, accepted the assurance, you'll find this on our briefs, that it wouldn't stop that kind of a problem, unaccompanied by any threat of economic pressure to a secondary employer.</text>
