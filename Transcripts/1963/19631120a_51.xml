            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="38.818" offset="258696">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.049" offset="267577">This is an appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana which denied preliminary and permanent injunctions sought by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.155" offset="320031">This was a statutory three-judge court because the appellants sought an injunction against state officers seeking to enjoin them from enforcing a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.428" offset="377083">The opinion below -- the decision below was 2-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.927" offset="395055">The majority opinion by Judges West and Ellis voting for denial of the injunction and the dissenting opinion by Judge John Minor Wisdom of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for granting the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.555" offset="465586">Judge Wisdom also dissented on the denial of the permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.821" offset="490663">The statute which the appellants sought to enjoin is Louisiana Revised Statutes Section 18-1174.1, which was enacted in 1960 along with 35 other laws bearing on interracial relations which are set forth and discussed in a law review article in the Louisiana Law Review by Professor Wollett.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.704" offset="618141">And this statute essentially requires that in every application or notification for candidacy in state or local elections or any certification of a candidate for office and on the ballot, the race of the candidate be set forth, whatever that race may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.296" offset="720541">And the race must be set forth in type the same size as the type of a candidate's name.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.937" offset="755127">The facts in the case are not at all in dispute, they are derived from the complaint and the answer in a brief stipulation, all of which appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.829" offset="806640">The majority opinion rests on two principle grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.181" offset="840077">First, appears on page 32 of the record and that is that Negro candidates were treated on the same basis as white candidates that is, all candidates had to set forth their race following their name on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.004" offset="911339">And in so holding, the majority below distinguished the case from the only other case that deals with such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.690" offset="946134">In McDonald against Key, a Tenth Circuit decision and the Court held that in McDonald against Key, it was required only that Negro candidates state their race following their name on the ballot whereas in this case, all candidates are required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.611" offset="1013844">And then secondly, on page 31 of the record and also elsewhere in the opinion, the Court held that it was not disposed to create a shield against the brightest light of public examination of candidates for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.788" offset="1086568">Now, the appellants submit that the majority below was wrong and that Judge Wisdom was right and that Judge Wisdom was right for the very reasons that he set forth in the first two brief paragraphs of his opinion which appear on page 34 of the record, I think adequately summarized his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.157" offset="1172041">That is that in the eyes of the Constitution, a man is a man, he is not a white man, he's not an Indian, he's not a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.834" offset="1198686">If private persons identify a candidate for public office as a Negro, they have a right to do so but it is no part of the business of the State to put a racial stamp on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.712" offset="1246229">It is too close to a religious stand that has no reasonable relation to the electoral processes.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.370" offset="1356884">But I don't believe that the Fourteenth Amendment deals with questions of sex or questions of -- of the classic case of whether one is a redhead and so forth in the same way it deals with questions of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.008" offset="1407352">Race is, I think, narrow, well-established to be an impermissible standard for government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.333" offset="1432743">In fact, that's just the point we're getting to as the principal reason why we would urge that the statute is unconstitutional, the only reason why this possibly could be put on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.546" offset="1473599">In fact, the only conceivable reason is so that people go into the polling booth can act upon it so that they can make a racial determination or discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.259" offset="2616404">In fact, one of the reasons it isn't in the case here, one of the reasons we have this statute is because it isn't the case here, because we have this great body of case law in Louisiana as to who is a Negro and who is a white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.016" offset="2691427">It -- it is the obvious premise of Louisiana law that Negroes are inferior to white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.652" offset="2717968">It is a defamation in the State of Louisiana to call a white man a Negro and it's actionable no matter how slight the injury, how innocent the mistake in cases set forth demonstrating that.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.796" offset="2766555">To call -- to call one, they would -- to denominate one, a Negro under Louisiana Law calls for a higher standard of proof than its necessary to convict one of crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.689" offset="3410108">The point of this argument is really an a fortiori argument to show that not only are they -- not only are they -- they intruded race since the electoral process but it's not a neutral decision as they're claiming it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.963" offset="3451173">But it's a -- it's an intrusion into the electoral process to be seen in the context of the public policy of the State denominating Negroes as inferior.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.414" offset="3488998">In fact, as North Dakota doesn't do it and I don't think it's ever been suggested that it would or that anyone there was slightly interested in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.442" offset="3653151">And Louisiana has offered no explanation to allay the suspicions.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.005" offset="3675408">The only reason offered by the State and the court below is that this will inform the people but they have not set forth any reason as to why the people should be informed as to race.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.275" offset="3724518">And so we would submit that the State has first of all facilitated and encouraged citizens of Louisiana to make a racial distinction in the polling booth that it has exerted its effort -- exerted a great deal of effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.533" offset="3797556">In fact, in this term of the legislature passed 35 laws to establish what that discrimination should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.623" offset="3825873">And that it is offered to no justification except for the fact that it has done this to inform the people as to why it has passed such a law and that for all of these reasons, the statute involved is unconstitutional and the judgment below should be reversed.</text>
