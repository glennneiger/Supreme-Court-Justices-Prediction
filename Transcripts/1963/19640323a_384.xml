            <text syncTime="22.771" offset="194435">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.886" offset="206869">This is an appeal from part of an order of the District Court in New York which was reversed by the Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.456" offset="277191">It -- the Second Circuit vacated a stay that had been granted in an action brought under Section 301, to have part of law, to compel arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.347" offset="344795">Now, that portion of the order compelling arbitration was left undisturbed but in addition to the order compelling arbitration, we had sought a further order from the District Court staying the Union here from taking action which we believed was inconsistent with the issue to be arbitrated and which we felt that if this action had been taken by the Union, we would have been deprived to -- before our hearing, before the arbitrator of the merits of our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.860" offset="530787">The Circuit Court of Appeals vacated that stay which we received because it felt that the Norris-LaGuardia Act, Section 7, applied to it and that the procedural provisions of Section 7 had not been followed and indeed, they noted and we agree, could not have been followed in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.814" offset="650637">Now, to go back to the -- the issue that we had, it involved the disciplining of foremen who are employed by the Publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.723" offset="718242">We have a -- a common contract here to which all the New York City Publishers are signatory with this particular Union, in New York Mailer's Union Number Six.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.144" offset="767979">That Union is an affiliate of the International Typographical Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.234" offset="792325">And historically, in the relationships with this Union and with other unions, the Publisher's foremen are required to be members of the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.908" offset="862960">It has some -- some bad aspects to it from our point of view but it also has some good aspects and we're not here complaining about that contractual requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.691" offset="2582131">Now, we negotiated the Clause 20 (c) of the contract which says with this Union, that the Union will not discipline the foreman for carrying out the instructions of the management.</text>

            <text syncTime="658.452" offset="2737194">What we get to in this case is the applicability of Section 7 of the Norris-La Guardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.931" offset="2767078">Now, Mr. Sugarman before the Union goes further, he says that Section 4 of Norris-La Guardia Act applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.354" offset="2804799">He -- he takes the position that 4 (b), which deals with an injunction against becoming or remaining a member of the Union has application.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.324" offset="2844714">Well, we resisted that contention at all levels and it has not been accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.892" offset="2874911">Judge Hays in the Circuit Court held that Section 4 -- none of the provisions, subdivisions of Section 4 had any application here at all and we think that that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.166" offset="2932067">But Judge Hays did hold that Section 7 precluded us from having the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.663" offset="2969997">Now, we feel that the Lincoln Mills decision of this Court controls here.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.326" offset="3004688">We say that -- that the stay that we're asking for here, it's merely telling the Union, "Hold up, don't go ahead with the disciplinary proceedings until we can get to the arbitrator and the arbitrator can decide whether or not he should do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="743.134" offset="3075950">We're not asking that they'd be enjoined forever or prohibited forever.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.559" offset="3225579">Now, we think the Sinclair case Mr. Justice Harlan has no application at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.134" offset="3247940">It's distinguishable on the same grounds that within the majority opinion, the Lincoln Mills situation was distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.313" offset="3284616">We say that here, as in Lincoln Mills, the conduct involved in the injunction was not anyone of the kinds of conduct prohibited to Federal District Courts by Section 4 of the Act, and we say that's the limit of the prohibition in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.470" offset="3377298">Now, we say that our stay that we've been deprived off here by the Circuit Court stands on exactly the same footing as the mandatory injunction compelling arbitration which was ordered in Lincoln Mills and in all of the other cases that follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.289" offset="3452531">We're asking for enforcement of an additional provision of our contract, our status quo provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.249" offset="3480325">And we say that if that stands on the same footing as the promise to arbitrate, the promise to maintain the status quo is the same kind of a promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.269" offset="3524420">And we think that Section 7, I think when you read it and -- and you look at the -- the things that are -- that had to be met there was designed to meet the situation where injunctions are granted in -- in cases of violence and so forth and where it is not going to deal with any of the Section 4 matters that are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.976" offset="3635284">And -- and we think it's wholly inapplicable to a situation as this just as it was wholly inapplicable to the mandatory injunction to compel.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.111" offset="3695783">Within its own limits, we feel that the -- that the Sinclair case stands and we have to accept it but nevertheless, it does not apply to the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.000" offset="3755342">If -- if Norris-La Guardia, Section 7, applies to us then we say it also applied to Lincoln Mills and this Court said, "No, it didn't."</text>
            <text syncTime="921.695" offset="3790137">So we feel that we're in -- we're in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.812" offset="3818663">Now, we -- we feel that the -- that the policy announced by this Court in favoring arbitration which is really a -- a reaffirmation of -- of the congressional policy supports a position that we take here.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.704" offset="3878222">We think it's -- it's important that the parties in an arbitration get their full relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.996" offset="3931408">And -- and where the circumstances require some additional kind of remedy to support and foster the arbitration, that relief shouldn't be denied to them unless it comes specifically within one of the prohibitions of Section 4 of Norris-La Guardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.191" offset="4028165">And here, we don't come head on with Section 4, so therefore we think that the District Court in applying ordinary equitable principles, which it did when we went down to get our regional order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.965" offset="4103189">We had to satisfy the judge that we have complied with Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.508" offset="4141432">When we got before the district judge, he had to be satisfied that this was a proper application of the status quo clause that -- that we would have irreparable injury if we were denied the relief that we sought, that there was no adequate remedy at law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.998" offset="4375385">In -- in that case, the employer of the -- the Greyhound Bus Company, was going to move one of its garages or plants from, I think Washington, D.C to some other location, and the Union protested and claimed that the subject matter was arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.741" offset="4470366">And the employer didn't dispute that and as matter of fact, they went ahead and made plans to arbitrate the issue but because as often happens in -- in arbitrations, they couldn't get the case on to be heard that quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.578" offset="4537657">The employer was going ahead implementing its plans to make the move which of course would have frustrated the position of the Union there, if it were right that the employer had no right under the contract and an arbitrator would have so held to move the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.186" offset="4612159">So the Union went into the District Court and asked that the employer be stayed from moving the plant and the District Court considered that, Mr. Judge Kohlsaat and he granted the stay or the injunction and Norris-La Guardia was raised there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.586" offset="4685720">And I think Judge Kohlsaat quite properly held in the circumstances there that Norris-La Guardia should not have application because the subject matter involved was not Section 4 activity and -- and he held that Section 7 shouldn't apply either that it was inapplicable.</text>
