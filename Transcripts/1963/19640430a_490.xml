            <label>Mr. Myron N. Krotinger</label>
            <text syncTime="9.314" offset="140622">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.632" offset="149922">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.036" offset="175522">This case is a companion case to the Upjohn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.212" offset="200182">It has some different aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.657" offset="213974">Its history and how it arose, follow in many respects the Upjohn litigation following the effectiveness of the Ohio Fair Trade Act or, rather, its passage in June of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.725" offset="290252">On October 1st, 1959, Hudson was nullified by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. that Eli Lilly will continue to vigorously support fair trade and which is to give you notice of this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.810" offset="374575">This letter invited Hudson to enter into a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.232" offset="400280">This invitation was to -- was not taken up and on December 10th, 1959, a warning letter was sent from Eli Lilly to Hudson informing of the information that's come to Eli Lilly of sales below fair trade prices, again, enclosing duplicate copies of the fair trade agreement, enclosing "We trust your future operations will be strictly in accordance with the obligations imposed upon you under the Ohio Fair Trade Act so there will be no need -- occasion for any further controversy or litigation."</text>
            <text syncTime="124.165" offset="600064">The -- Hudson filed its petition for a declaratory judgment on the 22nd of October, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.908" offset="662967">This was followed by this warning letter and then by a second warning letter of January 26th, 1960 in which Hudson was told, "We are prepared to file suits for injunctions where contract violations cannot be worked out in a voluntary basis and we trust your future operations will be in accordance with your obligations under the contracts and under the Ohio Fair Trade Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="171.203" offset="788146">In other words, the demand was made that Hudson observe both the provisions of the Ohio -- rather, of the Lilly contract, as well as the fair trade pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.006" offset="843421">As in Upjohn, a cross-petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.925" offset="859094">Responsive pleadings were filed both to the petition and the cross-petition, and the case moved into a courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.714" offset="898278">Unlike Upjohn, in this case, there was a stipulation of facts and evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.308" offset="920639">Again, like Upjohn, the litigation on the Hudson pleading -- rather, on the complex of pleadings was limited solely to the petition, the answer and the reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.606" offset="989811">The rulings made by the courts below, the Court of Common Pleas, the Court of Appeals, the Highest Court of Ohio were all made in the -- both cases as written by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.663" offset="1046026">And as stated to the Court yesterday, the issues before the courts were limited to the constitutionality of the statute under the State and the Federal Constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.484" offset="1105272">Now, Your Honors, as we noted yesterday, the Supreme Court of Ohio limited and placed its ruling solely upon the issues of the State of Ohio Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.180" offset="1160129">It's as if the federal law did not exist and we believe that the Supreme Court of Ohio was misled or, at least, adopted the positions set forth both by Upjohn and by Lilly in their briefs, excuse me, namely, that the federal law had nothing to do with the legality of the Ohio Fair Trade Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.015" offset="1271411">This position was taken both by Lilly and by Upjohn forthrightly in the court below, and net result was that we have a situation where, in the brief of Eli Lilly &amp; Co. in this Court, the claim is made that a valid contract was instituted under the Ohio Fair Trade Act under Section 5 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="316.641" offset="1369945">Seven pages of the Lilly brief in this Court are devoted to that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.518" offset="1397426">In fact, Your Honors, at page 48, 48 or 49 of the Lilly brief in this Court, Lilly argues such a contract is within the common law meaning of a contract that is, under Section 1333.31, an implied contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.398" offset="1480913">Williston states that a contract may arise from a “sellers making a general offer to all the world in this way to be accepted by taking ownership on the property, provided consideration could be found from the promise of the purchaser and also, such communication to the promisee as is necessary for a contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="368.451" offset="1577148">The next sentence of this section of Williston which deals with notices on merchandise is to the effect, if the ultimate purchase is not from the offeror but from one who has acquired from him absolute and unqualified ownership, it would seem impossible to treat the purchase of the property as consideration for a promise of the purchaser to the original seller, unless it leads to the facts warranting the assumption that the immediate seller demanded, as part of the consideration of the sale, a promise to the original seller.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.438" offset="1913083">Except, Your Honor, I would suggest that the issue in the case is the interpretation of the federal exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.605" offset="1945788">In other words, where the Supreme Court of Ohio committed, in our opinion, basic error, is impending this case and the validity of a fair trade contract and price fixing in commerce as a matter of state law, rather than as a grant of federal exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.687" offset="2022170">The issue is a federal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.179" offset="2032097">Indeed, Your Honor, whenever a claim has been made, either by private party, administrative agency or government, that a price fixing contract is sought to be imposed upon anyone, the federal court, as in Schwegmann, looked at the statute and said, “Are there critical differences between the federal act and the state statute?”</text>

            <text syncTime="524.928" offset="2203042">Well, Your Honor, may I answer that by stating that the question is perhaps stated over-broadly in that you would -- you would suggest by the question that there was a total commitment of price fixing for the states by the McGuire Act without relevance to the federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.728" offset="2290291">And I would again suggest to Your Honor that the rulings of the Court, this Court foreclosed that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.980" offset="2315264">Contracts and agreements, signers and nonsigners have been two of the most bitterly litigated terms in American legal history where, for example, the McGuire Act was passed in 1952 to, one, due to the results of Schwegmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.936" offset="2379107">This was by means of the nonsigner concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.873" offset="2394885">At the time of the passage of that Act, there were 45 Fair Trade Acts in effect, each of which contained a nonsigner clause committed to the concept of signer and nonsigner.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.918" offset="2447026">The Congress knew perfectly well what was the image and contour of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.656" offset="2466043">Section 5 (a) (3) said, states, "We will now allow you where you have nonsigner clauses to make them operative.”</text>
            <text syncTime="598.741" offset="2498330">Beyond that, the Congress did not go.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.134" offset="2507943">It said in Section 5 (a) (2), “You may enter into contracts and agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.967" offset="2531244">The section-by-section analysis of the bill talked about contracts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="610.860" offset="2546813">The Congress further said, “You may enter into contracts by which you may require your contractee to enter into a further contract."</text>
            <text syncTime="621.888" offset="2590908">A statutory system was created and with that statutory system came, as professor McLaughlin pointed out, the resentment of holding a man to a contract he never made, so that over this basic nonsigner clause came this round of litigation through the different States whereby 24 such States have now held that the nonsigner clause is ineffectual.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.932" offset="2711071">Now, we find a different solution upon a different basis with a different premise in commerce undertaken by the State of Ohio based upon what was originally a national solution to a hotly contended economic issue but which one, basically, was a matter of national policy and as this Court pointed out, there has been no subject, perhaps in American history, so closely patrolled as the price fixing agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.771" offset="6298415">A major difference between the Upjohn case and the Lilly case is that the McKesson &amp; Robbins case issue that was discussed yesterday based on the claim that Upjohn has agreements with wholesalers, although it competes with them, is not an issue in the Lilly case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.180" offset="6364139">It was stipulated between the parties as a fact that Lilly does not sell to any retailers and therefore, does not compete with its wholesalers and that's -- so, that's not in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.406" offset="6417011">I don't think I need bother to discuss that beyond what is in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.111" offset="6439790">There can't be any question about the applicability of the Old Dearborn case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.656" offset="6457971">There's a rather timorous suggestion that it ought to be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.443" offset="6473122">It's a bedrock decision, a 30-year standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.546" offset="6485556">It was a unanimous court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.984" offset="6491303">The Due Process Clause reads exactly the same now as it did then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.499" offset="6513351">Now, on -- on the notice question, Hudson's argument just is that the McGuire Act sanctions only state statutes which require at least one express contract before you combine all the rest of the retailers in the State by notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.962" offset="6595271">Now -- and that the Ohio Act exceeds that congressional mandate because it permits fair trade enforcement by notice only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.489" offset="6629334">Now, that just is not the meaning of these statutes or their interrelationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.969" offset="6651277">I -- I have no hesitation making the flat statement that if one reads the McGuire Act with the objective of giving effect to the purpose of the Congress in enacting it, it's not possible to conclude that it doesn't permit what Ohio did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.472" offset="6705298">Congress intended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.823" offset="6710627">I realize it had to say it, too, in the statute but it did say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.207" offset="6724211">Now, what was the background of the McGuire Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.549" offset="6741556">In 1937, Congress had enacted the Miller-Tydings Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.150" offset="6759946">It didn't mention nonsigners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.134" offset="6771858">As we have now been told by the House Report on the McGuire Act, Congress intended in the Miller-Tydings Act to permit fair trade to be enforced against all alike, whether parties to a contract or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.554" offset="6825566">Congress thought, as we have now been told in the House Report that there wasn't any Sherman Act violation anyway without a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.643" offset="6853987">And if you -- and if Congress said the state law may authorize the contract, enforcement against -- enforcement rights against nonsigners would follow automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.934" offset="6895156">Now, unfortunately, the language that Congress used in the Miller-Tydings Act didn't reveal its intention with unmistakable clarity and so, in the Schwegmann case, this Court held the Sherman Act bans not only expressed fair trade contracts but the implied obligation that arises when a purchaser with notice acquires goods and then uses the trademark which has been notified the subject to the price restrictions in the resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.514" offset="7009468">And the Court held Congress didn't articulate its intention to accept from the Sherman Act that implied obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.395" offset="7040920">Now, what did Congress do then?</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.770" offset="7046457">It very promptly passed the McGuire Act and this time, to make sure nobody could misunderstand its intention again, it laid it out in about 10 or 12 different ways, both in the House Report which explained and recommended the McGuire Act in the very form in which it passed and in the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.215" offset="7120227">Let me just review briefly what they did say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.082" offset="7135692">In the House Report, first, they said, in substance, “We intended the Miller-Tydings Act to permit state Fair Trade Acts to be enforced with respect to the implied obligation reaching with respect to the fellow who purchases with notice and then uses the trademark and cuts the price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.333" offset="7208730">Then they said, in the Schwegmann case, it was held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.142" offset="7223986">We overruled it, not part of it, all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.538" offset="7237569">They said, “We want to make it abundantly clear that Congress means to let these state Fair Trade Acts operate and be enforced in their totality” and they didn't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.664" offset="7281977">They said, “We want to remove any federal obstacle to a broader interpretation of the state fair trade laws in interstate commerce” and lest anybody think that they were only talking about just the fair trade contracts that were in -- then on the books, they said, “We think the states should be permitted to experiment further with fair trade legislation” and they still didn't stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.440" offset="7377168">They said, “So far as the Federal Government is concerned, we want to leave the States free to protect their trade against these predatory price practices in the manner best known to them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.061" offset="7419591">Now, that's the House Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.300" offset="7424606">There couldn't be any question about their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.655" offset="7434010">Now, let's see whether this time, they were able to find the English words to give effect to -- to reveal the purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.737" offset="7614360">Let's see if they were able to say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.548" offset="7629615">In the first place, the preamble of the Act says that its purpose is to protect the rights of the States to regulate their internal affairs by adopting laws and policies authorizing the enforcement of fair trade prices against all alike, whether parties to a contract or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.572" offset="7825638">Those -- those contracts are made lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.536" offset="7837550">It is also made lawful to enforce those prices against one who hasn't signed any contract if he's notified that “this is our trademark and if you acquire the goods and if you use our trademark in the resale, you don't use the trademark, it doesn't matter, if you use our trademark in the resale, this minimum price applies to you even though you are not a party to the contract,” so the preamble said, as I have recited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.377" offset="7956877">Now, when they got to the main operative provision of -- in paragraph 2 of the McGuire Act, they did not just repeat the language that this Court had regarded as applying only to express contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.921" offset="8015078">They said, “We want any, any contracts or agreements that are lawful under the state law for resale price maintenance to be enforceable despite the Sherman Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.403" offset="8065024">Now, I note in passing that that phrase -- that in using that phrase “any contracts”, they were using a phrase that this Court, many years ago, had construed when the phrase was included in another federal statute to be comprehensive enough to include “not only expressed contracts but contracts which arise by implication.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.399" offset="8153004">Now, to further forestall any misinterpretation, they said -- they added paragraph 3 to the Act which said that "the antitrust laws of the United States were not to prevent the exercise or the enforcement of any right or any right of action created by any state statute, state law or state policy against a person willfully failing to observe state fair trade prices, whether party to a contract or not."</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.098" offset="8291767">Now, lest anybody might think that they were putting the States in a straight jacket of just the fair trade laws they had then, both in paragraph 2 about the contract and in paragraph 3 about enforcement against parties not party to a contract, they said, “We mean contracts and rights of enforcement recognized by state statutes now or hereafter in effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.830" offset="8386644">And in paragraph 3, they said, "This nonsigner enforcement we're talking about is the enforcement permitted by any state statute which, in substance, provides that willfully and knowingly disregarding the prices is actionable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.274" offset="8444426">And then, I think this is about number 12 on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.927" offset="8463130">To -- To just put an additional copper rivet in it, they added paragraph 4, which said, "None of these contracts, any contracts in 2, none of these enforcement rights under 3 shall constitute an unlawful burden on interstate commerce, restrain on interstate commerce or interference with the interstate commerce."</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.805" offset="8534601">Now, this time, Congress left nothing to the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.610" offset="8549857">It didn't whisper its intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.986" offset="8555290">It -- it roared, it repeated itself and it underscored that the antitrust laws are not a part of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.357" offset="8588831">They're made by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.989" offset="8595310">And Congress wanted to make clear this time that they meant to accommodate the right of the States to permit vertical resale price maintenance as they saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.182" offset="8640136">Now, Hudson has a chivilla for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.714" offset="8654242">They say, well, this Ohio Act permits fair trade enforcement by notice only and the McGuire Act requires at least one express contract before you combine the other 2000 by notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.809" offset="8710562">Now, among other things, that assumes facts that are not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.160" offset="8736057">Lilly established its fair trade prices by express contracts with 1400 retailers, 65% of the retailers in the State of Ohio and gave notice to all the others of the prices established in those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.060" offset="8791646">And furthermore, the argument assumes an interpretation of the Ohio statute that the Ohio courts have not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.464" offset="8829262">The Ohio statute can be read to mean that you establish your price in the first instance by an express contract and control it from thereon by contracts or notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.324" offset="8876701">Now, I don't say that's inevitable that it has to be read that way, but it could, particularly if it was thought they were a constitutional question if it were interpreted the other way and as a matter of fact, although the Ohio Supreme Court didn't discuss the matter, if you look at page 402 of the Upjohn record where the Court of --</text>

            <text syncTime="2233.577" offset="9037720">At page 402 of the Upjohn record, the Court of Appeals did interpret the -- the Ohio statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.622" offset="9065827">They -- after reciting that they adopted an Act which -- that Ohio adopted an Act somewhat enlarging on the Virginia Act and -- and by the way, on the reference to the ball of the case where he said the -- that the Virginia courts held that remote parts wasn't as good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.147" offset="9139911">The Virginia statutes differ for one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.214" offset="9152240">The Ohio statute says and the Virginia statute does not, whether buying from the original vendor or not, but the -- the Court of Appeals said, in referring to the Ohio system of resale price maintenance, this is accomplished by fixing fair trade prices by contracts with other retailers with notice of such prices to the retailer involved and the retailer then purchasing such articles for resale on the retail market with knowledge that under the law, he has impliedly contracted to maintain fair trade prices by purchase for resale under such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.994" offset="9299362">Now, the -- the relationship of the nonsigner, under Ohio law, is one of implied contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.964" offset="9331231">That made a difference in Ohio because the courts had held if it wasn't contractual, it wasn't -- Ohio requirements weren't satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.236" offset="9356309">The Ohio legislature created that as a method of entering into a contract by action of the party and the courts then said, in this case, Ohio requirements are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.363" offset="9408867">Now, I want to mention one other thing that Mr. Krotinger -- he cited Williston on common law which, of course, Ohio is not bound by whatsoever, but he quoted a provision that indicate that there might not be a contract if the purchaser was remote, in other words, not the immediate purchaser but one further down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.756" offset="9498415">We must always distinguish between the commodity and the trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.997" offset="9519313">Nobody acquires ownership of our trademark when they buy the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.189" offset="9540106">Now, I say, whether it was an implied contract, it made a difference in Ohio but under Ohio only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.492" offset="9561318">Federally, it made not slightest difference whether the State denominated this relationship, a contract or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.230" offset="9588276">If it's an implied -- if you're in a State that calls it an implied contract, then it's clearly enforceable under paragraph 2 of the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.811" offset="9626624">If it isn't a contract, but there are contracts with others and Hudson is notified of the prices in those contracts, then it's -- it's -- Hudson is caught under paragraph 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.607" offset="9673749">And since here, it's both an implied contract and there are other contracts of which it had notice, it's got under both so the only difference it makes federally is which section you're proceeding under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.798" offset="9718575">Now, I would like to turn to the other question which, as I say, is briefed but has not been discussed by Mr. Krotinger and that is their argument that Section 29 (b) (2) of the Ohio Act permits horizontal agreements between competitors and horizontal boycotts and therefore, cannot apply in interstate commerce because of paragraph 5 of the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.933" offset="9819094">Now, the provision he bases it on is the provision in paragraph 29 (2) that says that a fair trade contract may require a vendee to obtain fair trade contracts from those to whom he resells on resale, an exact counterpart of the same provision in paragraph 2 of the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.329" offset="9908642">This wasn't in the Miller-Tydings Act but Congress is taking no chances this time and it put it in and it's -- and it wasn't anew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.013" offset="9935391">This is not an Ohio invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.398" offset="9940929">Every Fair Trade Act in the country had such a provision in it in one form of words or another at the time Congress enacted the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.329" offset="9976665">The argument, as I understand it, of Hudson is that the resale by the vendee, who's required to get further contracts, might be a competitor and if so, paragraph 5 of the McGuire Act would prevent one retailer from getting a fair trade contract from another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.195" offset="10052106">Well, if that's so, and I think there's a lot of argument as to whether it is so that I won't go into, but suppose it is so, well, then the same is true under Section 34 of the Ohio Act which similarly prevents contracts between retailers, between wholesalers and between manufacturers and that provision of Section 34 limits every provision of the Ohio Act unless specifically excluded and Section 29 (b) (2) does not specifically exclude it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.974" offset="10371218">Hudson's argument is, there is a provision in the expressed contract of Lilly that requires the retailer not to resell to fair trade violators and he says, as I understand it, Hudson says this is enough like the 29 (b) (2) provision that it may be impliedly authorized and -- and involve the horizontal ban and -- and so -- and -- and therefore, it's not a good provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.185" offset="10496084">Now, I should say that it's doubly hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.163" offset="10520012">There is no -- not a word in the record, no claim that Lilly's -- has entered into any horizontal agreements with anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.293" offset="11396577">Now, the Ohio courts have not said whether this paragraph seeks refusal to -- to sell is or is not authorized by the Ohio Act by Section 29 (b) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.763" offset="11442448">I must say that in most States, the refusal to sell is a permissible method of enforcement because one fundamental aspect of fair trade is that if you're going to have a program, it's got to be uniform against all alike, not let some go merrily along violating while the others comply, but the Ohio courts haven't said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.350" offset="11512769">Now, if it is alright under paragraph 29 (b) (2) in the Ohio court note, then it' also alright under paragraph 2 of the McGuire Act because it has the same provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.777" offset="11550490">If it runs afoul of paragraph 5 of the McGuire Act, it also runs afoul of Section 34 of the Ohio Act and if it's not a good provision, the Ohio Act can't be tainted by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.426" offset="11601063">This has nothing to do with the constitutionality of Ohio Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.959" offset="11611199">It's just a question of whether Lilly can enforce a particular contract provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.256" offset="11628440">They've made no attempt to and we don't know whether they can or not, very frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.009" offset="11643382">Now, let me make one last assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.370" offset="11656861">Let's suppose paragraph 6 isn't authorized by either Act or although the reasoning by which this might be done eludes me, let's suppose we could find that it is authorized by the Ohio Act but not by the McGuire Act, it -- it wouldn't make the slightest difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.384" offset="11724884">Paragraph 9 of the same Lilly contract, our record at page 14, says this, “This contract shall be interpreted under and shall be subject to the limitations imposed by the Fair Trade Act of the State in which the retailer does business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.010" offset="11799385">And in the event any provision of this contract shall be held invalid under such Act or any other statute, law or public policy or to be held inapplicable with respect to any given set of facts or circumstances, then or in either such events, this -- that provision is severed out of the contract and the rest of the contract remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.663" offset="11873991">So even if paragraph 6 were bad under the Ohio Act, it just couldn't under this -- it would be severed out and couldn't apply to intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.932" offset="11907114">If it's good under the Ohio Act but not good under the McGuire Act, well, paragraph 9 says you sever it out in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.333" offset="11932714">It just doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.294" offset="11948596">Now, I -- I believe -- I submit that if there was ever a case in which Congress went to unusual lengths to guarantee that its decision to turnover to the States a particular area of regulation would not be thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.887" offset="12026964">This is that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.974" offset="12035218">The will of Congress was thwarted once or the intention of Congress, I should say, when the Miller-Tydings Act was held not to be enforceable against persons who hadn't signed a contract and to be sure that's Congress' own fault, that can be laid to the fact they didn't use enough words in the Miller-Tydings Act to reveal their real intention, but this time, they have and I respectfully submit that the will of Congress should not be thwarted a second time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.858" offset="12486823">But there are some pretty rigid requirements to get these questions properly raised and decided and before this Court and it's the burden of the appellant to show that he has got them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.217" offset="12548263">The questions have got to be properly raised below and that has to do with the -- under Ohio practices, including them both in the assignments of error and in the brief, and preserving them from one court to another and not raising it here, skipping the intermediate court and then raising it in the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.895" offset="12619003">It has to be properly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.690" offset="12626108">Furthermore, it's got to be either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.673" offset="12634049">Actually, to bring the question here, either actually decided by the courts so you can read it and see it or it's got necessarily to have been decided in the sense that there are no possible interpretation of the state statute under which the Court could have been concluded that the Constitution was violated because the statute is not to be interpreted in such a way as to raise it and then, finally, the judgment of the highest court of the State, the Ohio Supreme Court in this case, must be final and here in our case, as in the Upjohn case, there has been a remand and as a matter of fact, one or two other questions that are being raised here are -- have been raised in the remand proceedings and yet, they say they're here and so, I believe that the -- that this appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.512" offset="12873435">If it is not, if Your Honors retain jurisdiction, I think it's as clear as the English language could make it, that the McGuire Act carefully and explicitly and completely almost repetitiously authorized what Ohio has done here and the judgment holding the Ohio act constitutional should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.683" offset="13526079">On -- on the HR 5767, the 1952 House Report, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.553" offset="13557635">Paragraph 2, with the two exceptions referred to below, this paragraph contains substantially the same provisions as those contained in the first proviso of the Miller-Tydings Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.537" offset="13609566">In substance, this paragraph provides that neither the Federal Trade Commission Act nor any of the Antitrust Acts shall make unlawful a contract proscribing minimum or stipulated prices for the resale of a trademarked commodity in open competition of other commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.585" offset="13685739">This paragraph differs from the Miller-Tydings Act in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.444" offset="13705174">First, it includes a provision expressly covering contracts which proscribe stipulated prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.826" offset="13734640">Such contracts are not expressly covered by the Miller-Tydings Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.275" offset="13752508">Second, it includes a provision expressly covering a contract which requires a vendee to enter into another contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.792" offset="13786572">In other words, Your Honors, nobody in 1952 thought about notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.716" offset="13810186">It wasn't even an issue before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.919" offset="13823039">This is all reading back after the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.016" offset="13835473">And as Mr. Priest, the Chairman of the House Committee, as shown in our brief, said to the Congress, “Our purpose is to let the laws now, in effect, operate as they operated from 1937 until the date of the Schwegmann relief, the laws then in effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.425" offset="13913109">Now, Your Honors, the effect of the broadened reading that Mr. Willis would like to give us would be to state that the State of Ohio can, for example, take a proprietary interest concept in the Old Dearborn case which was made in 1936 in an intrastate transaction, without relationship to a federal enabling law, take a formula and a standard which wasn't even mentioned in the Miller-Tydings Act and the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.309" offset="14044557">And so, now, we say, in 1958, the notice was contemplated by the Congress in 1952, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.002" offset="14083427">The proprietary interest of 1958 was contemplated in 1952, not at all, not a word about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.907" offset="14118954">Why do we get both notice and proprietary interest in 1958, because this is the third round of fair trade legislation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.291" offset="14160541">This is the solution, Your Honors, and the answer to the declarations of unconstitutionality of the nonsigner clauses in 24 States and where the Congress points out in the report on the Harris Bill that unless we do this, fair trade is dead in 16 States, now 24 and this is the manufacturer's means of giving notice of his proprietary interest and reestablishing his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.582" offset="14285720">This history you have been hearing, Your Honors, is after the event, reading events of 1952 backward in a way which was never contemplated at the time and which any reasonable reading of a legislative history will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.131" offset="14355937">Point 2, Your Honors, we come to the business of the due process issue and how it was raised and its reasonable scope.</text>
