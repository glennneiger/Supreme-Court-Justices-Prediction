            <text syncTime="44.158" offset="280012">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.531" offset="297462">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.982" offset="335287">The case arose in March, 1960 at which time the sit-in movement or the movement which brings these cases before the Court at this time, was perhaps at its highest stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.088" offset="411773">One day before this case arose, some of the petitioners in this case went to the Office of the City Manager of the City of Columbia to discuss matters pertaining to the efforts of Negroes to use lunch counter facilities in the City of Columbia and at that conference, the record shows that the City Manager of the City of Columbia advised some of these petitioners, gentlemen, further demonstrations will not be tolerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.108" offset="567777">At that particular time, the -- most of the stores, drugstores and other stores which had lunch counters in the City of Columbia followed the policy of excluding Negroes or of segregating them therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.532" offset="641546">A few days before March 15, 1960, police officers working for the City of Columbia and other officers of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division working in cooperation with the City Police of the City of Columbia, learned that Negroes would make an effort to gain food service at the Taylor Street Pharmacy located in the City of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.655" offset="781981">Agent Carl Stokes of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division testified that he and other officers advised the management of Taylor Street Pharmacy that Negroes were coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.336" offset="840704">They had some meeting among themselves and worked out a plan whereby the action which was thereafter taken was formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.072" offset="887620">This plan was that among other things, that officers would be placed in the premises of the Taylor Street Pharmacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.590" offset="925759">On March 15, 1960, Agent Carl Stokes of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the Deputy Sheriff were on duty in the Taylor Street Pharmacy premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.161" offset="992005">They've been waiting there throughout the morning, up until the time the five petitioners here appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.509" offset="1029413">When the petitioners entered the store, they walked in quietly and some of them stopped near the front of the store to purchase some cards.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.768" offset="1426474">The Taylor Street Pharmacy is a very large drugstore in the City of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.778" offset="1626467">The manager of the store came into the lunchroom area and stationed himself at a point where he felt his voice could be heard by all and stated that the Negroes would not be served and that they would have to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.326" offset="1688639">At this time, Agent Stokes was standing right by the manager there in close proximity to him and after the -- the store manager had made his statement and petitioners did not move, Agent Stokes leaned over and said to the manager, "Now, you go over and tell each one of them in person or -- or directly to leave in my presence."</text>
