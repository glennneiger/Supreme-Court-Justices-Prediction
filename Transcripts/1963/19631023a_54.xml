            <text syncTime="512.447" offset="2153200">The statute is set forth in our brief to page 26, Section 812 (e) (1) of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.397" offset="2188936">Sub-section -- sub-paragraph (A) grants a deduction from gross estate, the so-called marital deduction for an amount equal to the value of any interest in property which passes or has passed from the descendent to a surviving spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.955" offset="2263228">Sub-paragraph (E) provides that in valuing the interest which passes to the surviving spouse for that purpose, where such interest or property isn't encumbered in any manner or where the surviving spouse incurs any obligation imposed by the descendent with respect to the passing of such interest, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to such spouse would be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.946" offset="2387153">Now, it seems to me that cannot be denied that the -- a requirement that the widow in order to receive the bequest convey property of her own to a third party is an obligation imposed by the descendent with respect to the passing of the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.541" offset="2453504">Now, the petitioners -- the respondents do challenge that, but I -- I don't see any basis for reading such a limitation into this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.230" offset="2492270">Specific -- particularly is that true because all this provision does is to incorporate the general principles for determining the value of a gift to any particular donee and there's no reason why the corporation would incorporate only a part of those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.830" offset="2550680">This is simply a general reference to the general principle for determining the value of a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.675" offset="2570115">I'm indebted in fact to respondents referring in their brief at page 19, a part of the committee report that we did not set out which says as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.088" offset="2611702">It says, "Describes the purpose of this provision as providing for the application in determining the value of any interest in property passing to the surviving spouse of rules which are generally applicable in determining the net value of any gift or bequest.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.199" offset="2672201">" This is simply an incorporation of the rules otherwise generally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.662" offset="2694040">Now, where those rules, the context in which we have to look for those rules is in the context where the identity of the donee is important because the statute asked not simply how much -- how you will determine the total amount of a gift made by the grantor?</text>
            <text syncTime="666.585" offset="2769690">Here, since the descendent has died, he certainly has given to somebody everything he owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.532" offset="2793514">What it asked is how you determine the amount of the gift to such spouse, to that particular donee and it's there I think that the Court of Appeals went astray and ignored that trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.907" offset="2834996">Now, the context in which the identity of the donee is important, are many.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.682" offset="2858088">For income tax purposes, the charitable contribution deduction depends upon whether the gift is to a charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.738" offset="2886301">For gift tax purposes, the identity of the donee controls not only the charitable contribution deduction and the marital deduction but also whether -- the extent to which a -- the $3000 annual exclusion is available which is limited to $3000 of gifts to anyone donee whether the gift splitting privilege is available, whether the donee is or who is secondarily liable for the gift tax because the donee is liable for the gift tax if it isn't paid by the donor.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.881" offset="3050872">Now -- so in all of those contexts, we do have a problem on identifying who the donee of what part of the gift is and that is the context that the estate tax statute refers to and I assert that in every such context, a gift, a transfer from A to B on condition that B make a transfer to C is a gift by A to C and not a gift to B. B is simply an intermediary who makes an exchange of properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.275" offset="3172498">Now, I -- several examples I think will make that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.696" offset="3186186">If I --if I give $10,000 to charity, one condition that the charity delivers a hundred shares of stock worth a $100 of shared to my son, no one would suggest that I am entitled to a charitable contribution deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.084" offset="3251702">On the other hand, if I give $10,000 to a stockbroker on condition that he convey the shares of stock to a charity, I would be entitled to the charitable contribution deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.820" offset="3294647">Likewise, if I asked the stockbroker to deliver the stock to my son, I think the stockbroker would be surprised to learn that he was a donee who is secondary liable to the gift tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.996" offset="3331323">He might be even more pleasantly surprised when it dawns on him that since it was gift, he wouldn't have to report it for income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.391" offset="3364968">Again, if I'd already given $3000 to my son so I couldn't take another annual exclusion for gift to him, I don't suppose I could claim one by showing that I never made a gift to the stockbroker.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.147" offset="4099950">Now, I say there's a similar question involving the administration expenses, but since the debts are much more important in amount and we -- both parties agreed to be controlled by the same principles, I would make the oral argument in terms of the debts but not specifically touch under administration expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.328" offset="4176645">The community estate, which in Texas law, it has an independent existence from the husband and wife individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.911" offset="4202977">The community estate had asset of $258,000 as I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.536" offset="4221471">It also had debts of $32,000 which consisted primarily of income taxes owing on community income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.823" offset="4262640">Now, only one-half of the community assets were includable in the decedent's estate admittedly and our argument is that only one-half of the community debts were deductable from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.639" offset="4301928">Now the decedent's will, however written, contained a provision directing his executors to pay all of the community debts, not merely one half, out of his half of the community property because of that provision, the estate claims that it is entitled to deduction for all of the community debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.483" offset="4381341">That is both which half allocable to his half and half allocable to her half and the Court of Appeals had held the claim again, Judge Wilson dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.096" offset="4427734">Now, I would like to start the statute on this provision is at page 25 of our brief and it provides that there shall be deducted from the gross estate such amounts for claims against the estate as are allowable under the laws of the jurisdiction administering the estate -- the estate, and it's page 25 and that is controlling provision here, that's clause 3 is the one directly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.049" offset="4587604">I'd like to (Inaudible) There's no disagreement at all, between the parties or with the courts below, that in the absence of the will provision, all that the estate could've been required to pay in order that it could've deducted would have been one half of the community debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.495" offset="4653328">Under Texas law, the community debts or the primary obligation of the community and upon this dissolution, they're chargeable one-half against each share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.388" offset="4696900">The husband is the manager of the community is personally liable for community debts but the wife is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.560" offset="4725635">But, as between him and the community, his liability is only secondary and if he pays the debts on his personal separate property, he's entitled to reimbursement from the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.645" offset="4769938">Therefore, it is established from the Texas law then of the death of a husband, the probate court which typically administers both the entire community estate and his separate estate, the probate court may charge against the decedent's estate only one-half of the community debt and must charge the other half against the wife share of the community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.882" offset="4858859">That's in the absence of the will.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.613" offset="5217782">Actually, you see the provision directing payment of all of the debts out of his half of the community property was also conditioned upon her election to take under the will.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.777" offset="5406490">Well, I agree but generally, a provision in a decedent's will pay to his wife's debts would qualify for marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.605" offset="5437837">Now, our argument on this question is again a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.845" offset="5462706">In our view, the very essence of the claim and the only reason why it's allowed as a deduction is that it is enforceable against the estate regardless of the testator's wishes and that therefore reduces the net value of the property over which she has testamentary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.287" offset="5536475">And something that it is payable by the executors only because the decedent exercised his testamentary power to direct the payment is not a claim against his estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.709" offset="5582242">It is, as Judge Wisdom described it, merely straight pecuniary legacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.360" offset="5600841">There's no difference, we say, between a $1000 legacy to a beneficiary and the direction to the executors to pay a $1000 debt that would otherwise be the primary obligation of the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.563" offset="5665625">In short, it's our position is that since without the will, he is staying within required to pay only one-half of the debts, only one-half of the debts were claimed against his estate enforceable against the estate and only one-half of the debts were deductible from the estate and for that reason, both in this issue and on the first, the judgment should be reversed.</text>
