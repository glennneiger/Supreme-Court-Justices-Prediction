            <text syncTime="16.091" offset="167685">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.182" offset="184090">This case comes here on petition for a writ of certiorari granted by this Court to a plaintiff-petitioner, Loretta Aldrich.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.115" offset="239783">It comes from the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.407" offset="264965">A matter in controversy arises over the refusal of the majority of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia to give full faith and credit to a Florida divorce decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.579" offset="325674">Briefly, these are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.679" offset="338108">Loretta Aldrich and Colonel M. S. Aldrich were married in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.937" offset="359111">Differences arose and they were divorced by the Circuit Court of Dade County, Florida in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.545" offset="401533">The decree of divorce -- both parties appear, I would -- I should say and the defendant, Colonel Aldrich contested the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.011" offset="439463">The decree of the court has found disposition of the matter and among other things directed that Colonel Aldrich paid to Mrs. Aldrich the amount of $250 for month alimony so long as she live and made the same lien against his estate in the event he -- of this death.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.647" offset="525981">Colonel Aldrich applied for a rehearing and the alimony was reduced at $215 per month but remained just as it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.978" offset="563284">There -- the other matters in the decree, he remained just as it had been before.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.930" offset="587107">Colonel Aldrich died in May 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.451" offset="601213">He had kept his payments current up until his death but he prepared for death.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.620" offset="629844">In this way, he transferred his property to his son, William T. Aldrich prior to his death where they had in mind the tax collector or Mrs. Aldrich, we don't know but Mrs. Aldrich was the one complaining here.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.840" offset="698702">She -- Colonel Aldrich's estate was up for a settlement in the Circuit -- in the -- in Putnam County, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.298" offset="736528">Mrs. Aldrich filed a suit there to set aside these alleged fraudulent conveyances that have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.259" offset="768397">When the Colonel's estate was appraised, although a wealthy man or a period had been a wealthy man, there was only $7000 appraised in his estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.338" offset="804760">It became necessary, of course, to set aside these conveyances if the decree of divorce was to be satisfied and the court put away and have been entered in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.952" offset="859199">The Circuit Court of Putnam County, West Virginia dismissed our complaint on the ground that the Circuit Court, shall we say it, didn't have jurisdiction to enter a decree requiring alimony to be paid by a man's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.683" offset="938088">The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia awarded the writ of error and then on argument by a divided court affirmed the Circuit Court of Putnam County, where we came here on a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.599" offset="1005798">Now, briefly, that it -- those are the facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.706" offset="1026173">The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, in deciding the case and refusing to give a full faith and credit to the Florida decree, said that the Florida decree made a wrong decision in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.463" offset="1085210">There is no dispute about the court having jurisdiction of the parties and jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.290" offset="1116557">But the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia proceeds to review the statutes and decisions of the State of Florida and rule that the Florida court has made a wrong decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.096" offset="1167757">In doing so, the Court of West Virginia had found something like this in the decisions of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.264" offset="1224391">"The alimony," this is the statement that often made in the Florida decree, "Alimony generally ends with the death of the husband."</text>
            <text syncTime="289.907" offset="1263052">Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that alimony ends with the death of the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.884" offset="1286875">We contend that the trial court, when it goes into the facts of the case, the needs of the wife, the amount of property that the husband has and possibly the -- the fault or wrong of the parties and a lot of parties that -- the part that the wife plead in acquiring the property still has a right to adjudicate alimony and make the same lien against the husband's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.785" offset="1406516">A court also in West Virginia cited a case of (Inaudible) in which the Supreme Court of Florida had ruled that alimony would not be paid after the death of the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.622" offset="1473912">But in that case, there were peculiar circumstances in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.179" offset="1488123">The court of -- in Florida, and that was an appellate court only of -- gave this decision, not the Supreme Court of Florida, held that -- that the husband shows estate would be liable for a certain amount of alimony for week in the event he died before the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.735" offset="1558340">The court also -- the trial court had awarded a permanent sum, a -- a substantial sum and that was done under a statute of -- of Florida which said that, "In any award of permanent alimony, the court shall have jurisdiction to award periodic payments or in a payment in a lump sum."</text>
            <text syncTime="389.523" offset="1661471">Now, the Supreme -- the court of Florida in that case had awarded a substantial lump sum to the wife and intended also to make alimony payable out of the husband's estate and -- after his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.034" offset="1711522">And the -- the court in Florida merely said this, said the wife couldn't get both if she took the lump sum, then any attempt to put alimony against the husband's estate was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.750" offset="1770350">That was the -- of course, she has no application whatsoever to our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.900" offset="1790934">The Supreme Court of Florida -- I mean the Supreme Court of West Virginia used that to defeat Mrs. Aldrich's claim for alimony out of the husband's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.766" offset="1842448">Now, this matter of making alimony or claim against the husband's estate is done in West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.858" offset="1878810">The decisions of West Virginia, we have two decisions of West Virginia and that support that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.304" offset="1904619">It couldn't be said that the -- the Florida decree was repugnant to the laws of West Virginia and therefore, it wouldn't be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.302" offset="1948609">It was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.998" offset="1955401">A -- a West Virginia court undertook to review the decisions of the State of Florida, the decision of the Florida court in this particular case of Aldrich versus Aldrich and in so doing, held that -- dismissed our complaint and held that alimony would not be payable out of the husband's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.467" offset="2045262">And consequently, the other cases -- the other matters in our case went out of the window, of course, if they had no claim for alimony, then we had no right to complain about the wrongful and fraudulent conveyances.</text>
