            <label>Mr. C. Harold Thweatt</label>
            <text syncTime="15.673" offset="166013">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.763" offset="174373">If the Court in this case takes the view that this entire case should have been tried to a jury, we nevertheless submit that on the facts of the case, the denial of a jury trial was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.562" offset="269667">Now, I want to briefly relate the facts of the case, the -- a woman by the name of Hettie Lowder, who is in her 80s, owns a 240-acre farm situated in Logan County, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.122" offset="359842">In 1953, she executed a five-year oil and gas lease covering 160-acres in kind out of this 240-acre farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.419" offset="425044">This lease by named assignment became owned by a man by the name of W. G. Haun.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.842" offset="458689">Mr. Haun assigned the lease to Herman Hurst, reserving an overriding royalty of 1/16th of 7/8ths of all production and that assignment on its face provided that the -- this reservation was made applicable not only to that 1953 oil and gas lease, but also to any extensions or renewal of that lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.856" offset="574777">The Meekers and Domestic Oil Corporation and other parties whose names are of no importance here, were -- became the owners of this oil and gas lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.902" offset="634964">They had a block of acreage and we're going to drill on the Robinson farm which abuts on this Hettie Lowder farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.460" offset="677177">The Robinson well on the Robinson farm was commenced in this five-year lease which didn't name to Herman Hurst but was actually owned by the plaintiffs here, Meekers and Domestic Oil Corporation, was about to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.378" offset="740916">So Mr. Hurst went to Mrs. Lowder and got a 30-day oil and gas lease, the primary term to commence after expiration of the existing lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.174" offset="792116">That term was, I believe, had a term -- term of 30 days from July 3rd, 1958 -- I mean, from June 3rd, 1958 to July 3, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.062" offset="847600">And that 30-day lease, now that's a regular form of oil and gas lease which provides that it shall endure for the primary term of the lease which was 30 days, and as long thereafter as there is production or under the Oklahoma law as long thereafter as drilling operations or operations on the lease are pursued with due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.592" offset="953762">Well this -- during the last two days of this 30-day oil and gas lease, the Robinson well wasn't down yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.309" offset="996603">They didn't know the results -- what the result of the Robinson well would be, so Mr. Hurst calls the location of the estate on the 30-day oil and gas lease, that is -- that's the initial operation of course for commencing an oil well, let's take the location.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.622" offset="1065880">He calls that to be done and there were $60 worth of bulldozer work done before the primary term of that lease expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.821" offset="1114676">The trial court found that there was a small circulating pit and roads that have been built.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.553" offset="1137560">There was no machinery of any kind moved on to the lease, nothing done, other than that little bit of bulldozer work.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.937" offset="1167130">But on July 22nd, now that reminds you that happened on July 2nd and July 3rd, that bulldozer work was done on that lease at 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.142" offset="1215927">On July 22nd, a representative from Ambassador Oil Corporation went over there and surveyed the situation and found what had been done and -- and concluded that the -- the -- that lease had been abandoned, that there was no oil and gas lease covering that tract of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.316" offset="1300668">And he consult -- he consulted counsel about that and it was advised by counsel that in judgment of counsel, that 30-day lease had terminated and was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.618" offset="1345808">So on July 22nd, Ambassador Oil Corporation procured from Hettie Lowder or bought from her an oil and gas lease which covered not only the 160-acres which is covered by the 30-day lease but also covered the other 80-acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.985" offset="1419264">In other words, it covered 240-acres and distinguished from 160-acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.996" offset="1483316">So they paid her in cash, that's the bonus in consideration of $1800 which they called a -- that's the bonus and the royalty which was 1/8 from production.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.960" offset="1519261">Alright, now that as I say, that happened after the facts had been disclosed to counsel, ask to investigate the situation and the counsel had told, "Ambassador, that lease is dead."</text>
            <text syncTime="364.522" offset="1561475">So they go buy the lease and in due course, of course Ambassador is a company, the leases have to be processed through the right -- right in their channels, their main office is in Fort Worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.080" offset="1607659">Their lease was put on record, I believe in about August 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.678" offset="1630124">I'm not really sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.993" offset="1635349">But anyways, shortly after they acquired the lease, the lease was put on record.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.030" offset="1651440">Now, still nothing done under this 30-day lease, nothing done but the land had been -- the bulldozer work had been done out there, the -- related to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.178" offset="1692087">In the first part of September, about September 7th or 6th, without any examination of title, now that's unusual for that to happen because ordinarily oil company and anybody drilling a well is very particular to investigate the title and find out that somebody hasn't done what the plaintiff claims, Ambassador did here, jumped their claim or jumped their lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.109" offset="1807757">And -- but they didn't examine the title any further and moved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.478" offset="1825311">Domestic was the operator and now I say they -- now, that's -- that's Domestic and Meeker and other parties who owned the working interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.377" offset="1860838">In other words, they were the drilling parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.522" offset="1869511">The royalty interest, of course is a free interest, an overriding royalty if this is -- the Court knows as a free interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.447" offset="1893125">But anyway, the parties that owned the working interest, they started the well.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.787" offset="2350477">Oh, well after the September, after this lease -- I think that's worked on about 6th or 7th of September of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.749" offset="2386317">Why somehow, some representative of Ambassador happened to know this, the fact that a drilling had been commenced on that farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.521" offset="2417455">When I was called by a representative of Ambassador and he said, "Must we be -- they commenced drilling out there on that tract."</text>
            <text syncTime="585.537" offset="2445563">So I immediately picked up the telephone, called Mr. Ed Brook who was President of -- of Domestic Oil Corporation and -- and told him that Ambassador claimed they owned the oil and gas lease on that tract of land that they were drilling a free well for Ambassador.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.755" offset="2510346">And of course that calls some consternation.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.200" offset="2524139">Here -- in other words, the 30-day -- the Domestic was drilling under the 30-day lease which Ambassador said it terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.236" offset="2552351">Ambassador had an oil and gas lease which it had obtained on July 22nd and which it was placed to record August 8th, so there were two oil and gas leases which were in opposition to each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.332" offset="2620688">Yes sir, because the Robinson well turned out to -- it turned out to be a productive well.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.968" offset="2643257">I think it was completed either -- it was on the processes of completion about the time this work (Inaudible) -- this bulldozer worker was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.569" offset="2677635">Now, I think they recently said and probably knew that they were going to have a well.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.882" offset="2694875">Now, the feature of this case and of disturbed Judge Rizley was the fact that Ambassador had taken this oil and gas lease and had top leased the other oil and gas lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.928" offset="2735104">And that caused Judge Rizley, the trial judge, the district judge for the Western District, one of our judges, considerable concern because there's -- there were several complaints filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.571" offset="2773661">I think this is a Third Amendment complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.995" offset="2783378">The -- Ambassador was accused of piracy and several other things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.418" offset="2801037">So -- and it -- it did concern Judge Rizley quite a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.803" offset="2814621">But because Ambassador took the lease, they didn't go to Domestic and say here, "We've top leased your lease, we want the release of your lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.747" offset="2850356">We just took our lease and we put it on the record."</text>
            <text syncTime="688.562" offset="2857671">And -- and under advice of counsel, that -- that lease was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.955" offset="2879195">Now, that's -- it was Ambassador's possession on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.916" offset="2911065">Yes, sir and informed him that they were drilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.089" offset="2919737">So at that point, the Domestic -- Mr. Brook's, Domest -- Mr. Brook, President of Domestic consulted an attorney there who represented the Domestic Oil Corporation and that attorney informed this Mr. Don Stinchecum, his name is mentioned in the opinion written by Judge Phillips in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.623" offset="3005837">Mr. Stinchecum informed Mr. Brook that he was afraid that that 30-day oil and gas lease was dead and that what -- they had better do is see Ambassador and make the best deal they could have to see if they can compromise the thing out in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.055" offset="3063620">So Mr. Hurst did see Ambassador and Ambassador made an arrangement with Domestic where under Ambassador was paid a cash consideration of $2500 for this oil and gas lease that Ambassador bought for $1800 and reserved an additional override of $2500, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.216" offset="3164244">My figures may be a little long.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.624" offset="3169886">I think that's about right though payable of a -- of a -- most of the working interest, so that Ambassador came out with $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.676" offset="3202069">Now, this -- after that happened, after those events happened, why Mr. Brook caught Mr. Meeker in San Francisco or California somewhere, he was out of town or -- oh, no that is not correct, it was not after they happened, while they were happening or after -- after Mr. Stinchecum had advised Mr. Brook or Domestic that they should obtain the Ambassador lease if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.174" offset="3300080">Why, Mr. Brook testified as he reach Mr. Meeker in California and talked with him on the telephone and Mr. Meeker testified to this too.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.100" offset="3339786">I mean, these are in the record here, these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.067" offset="3351594">Talked to Mr. Meeker and Mr. Meeker told him what counsel had told Domestic and Mr. Meeker said, "Why, just ignore that lease, go ahead and drill that well.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.922" offset="3387016">Ignore that lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.781" offset="3390464">Pay no attention to their claim."</text>
            <text syncTime="823.740" offset="3398301">But Domestic chose to follow the advice of counsel rather than the advice of Mr. Meeker, so that Domestic took an assignment as they did here with Ambassador and took an assignment of the Ambassador lease, and that was a compromise or a settlement in behalf of everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.673" offset="3470085">That's what the -- the trial court so found and the Court of Appeals so found that that -- that assignment from Ambassador to Domestic was in settlement of the entire controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.156" offset="3527973">Now, there was no authority on the part of Domestic to settle Mr. Meeker's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.205" offset="3564231">Now, that's admittedly but there were co-tenants and their operating agreement was not put in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.749" offset="3594324">I don't know whether it gave him authority or not but anyway, that's -- that -- we'll have to assume that there was no authority and it was done without authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.279" offset="3624521">But after that happened -- after they'd made a deal with Ambassador, why Domestic -- now, they've gotten down in two days time about 20 -- 2000 some odd feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.039" offset="3675512">So, there was in this well, they never acquired a way sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.807" offset="3686588">I think there's a well that's 4800 or -- depth, the depth, I think that's in the record too.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.668" offset="3706023">So they had commenced the well that is believing that the 30-day lease was valid but they estopped it and then made the deal uncompromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.976" offset="3743326">And Mr. Meeker, as I said, objected to that kind of a compromise and told Domestic they should just ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.991" offset="3767359">Well, they didn't do that and they went on there and made the deal with Ambassador and drill the well on down, got a productive well.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.573" offset="3801631">Mr. Meeker came back from California, was informed of all the facts and decided that he would take an assignment of his interest in the Ambassador lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.508" offset="3861400">And he did take an assignment of his interest in the Ambassador lease and he was still contending that Ambassador had robbed Domestic, that Ambassador was a bunch of crooks, that the Domestic was wrong in yielding to Ambassador, all those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.030" offset="3931512">He testified that and there is no doubt but that's what he believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.802" offset="3950529">And in the assignment which he took from Domestic, he reserved his right to contest the -- the Ambassador lease and a right to contend that the 30-day lease was the valid lease rather than the Ambassador lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.004" offset="4023359">That -- that assignment is -- that really -- important portions of it are quoted at page 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.114" offset="4059826">That particular assignment also contained this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.530" offset="4081455">This assignment is subject to all of the provisions of the lease assignment from Ambassador Oil Corporation to Domestic Oil Corporation, recorded in Book 390 at page 592, to the Office of the County Clerk of Logan -- Logan County, Okalahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.797" offset="4150523">Now in one breath, he says, "I deny the Ambassador lease."</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.208" offset="4176227">In the next breath he says, "I take this assignment subject to all of the terms and provision of the assignment from Ambassador to Domestic."</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.075" offset="4223666">Now, the assignment from Ambassador to Domestic contained this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.848" offset="4254804">And Your Honor, this is the reference again to the -- you know, you'd rather bear in mind that there were two leases and contraposition to each other, the 30-day lease and the Ambassador lease, I think that's the way to refer to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.050" offset="4307571">Now, the assignment of the Ambassador lease contain this provision, it's quoted at page 4 of our brief, "That the lease hereby assigned is the effective oil and gas lease, covering the land here and above described and that the lease of record", now that's the 30-day lease, "under which Assignee", of course that's Domestic, he was doing the drilling, "commenced drilling operations, has terminated and is no longer effective".</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.260" offset="4560436">And commencement of operations alone is sufficient to hold of the lease, so that they could have Domestic and Meeker and the other working interest owners could have under that 30-day lease had they -- can move forward with diligence, have perpetuated that oil and gas lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.826" offset="4626683">Now, the excuse that they put up for not doing that is that they hadn't commenced that well and Sunray -- some representatives of Sunray Oil Corporation called them on the telephone and said, "Hey, can you drill on that well on a 10-acre pattern?</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.539" offset="4705573">We don't think that's wide enough spacing in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.931" offset="4715081">We're going to apply to the Corporation Commission for 40-acre spacing and we ought not to drill that well on that pattern."</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.729" offset="4742248">Now that was there excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.077" offset="4747682">That was Domestic's excuse for withholding operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.718" offset="4762206">But both Judge Rizley and the -- and -- oh and subsequent to that time, the Sunray did file for 40-acre space and that controls where your wells maybe drilled and so forth as the court knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.438" offset="4817168">Subsequent to that time, why the Sunray did file for spacing, filed a spacing application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.020" offset="4843499">And under the Oklahoma law, after there is an application for spacing, no well maybe drilled at any other location without a special order of the Corporation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.565" offset="4893654">But this well had been commenced prior by the bulldozer work had been commenced prior to the application of Sunray and nothing would have prevented Domestic from drilling that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.784" offset="6838523">The plaintiff and through Domestic and others was in possession, there's no question of possession involved in this action at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.550" offset="7069550">And that such acts of said defendant were for the purposes of depriving these plaintiffs of their lawful contract rights and mineral interest and for a wrongful, monetary benefit to themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.501" offset="7309354">At the conclusion of the evidence, Ambassador moved for judgment and so did Hettie Lowder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.293" offset="8576502">There are two ways to deny a jury trial in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.017" offset="8607431">One of them is to classify the action as equitable and say you're not entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.203" offset="8644211">The other way is to pick out some undisputed fact in the case and say, "Mr. Plaintiff as a matter of the law, you don't have any cause of action to go to the jury."</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.017" offset="8715473">This can be worked separately or together but either is just as effective as the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.946" offset="8751208">Now, is this Court going to say to that we will protect your right to a jury trial in the one instance, but that if you'll pick out some fact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.688" offset="8814111">If you'll pick out some fact and it doesn't make any difference whether you apply the law, the substantive law of the state right or wrong, even though you're quite wrong, all you have to do is say that under the facts of this case you have no cause to the -- go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.740" offset="8902301">And whether the trial court applies the law correctly or incorrectly, that does away with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.214" offset="8932185">I think this Court will not say that because that would open the way clearly and obviously to a way to effectively deny the constitutional right to a jury trial.</text>
