            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Davis, Secretary, State Board of Elections et al., versus. Harrison Mann.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.316" offset="153663">Mr. McIlwaine, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_d_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="14.847" stopTime="554.689">
            <label>Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III</label>
            <text syncTime="14.847" offset="163798">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.048" offset="176546">Under the principles formulated in the brief and advocated at the bar of this Court, the Solicitor General undertakes to condemn the Virginia reapportionment system as violative of the second postulate he lays down in that the Virginia system allegedly departs from the per capita standard without rhyme or reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.043" offset="256585">Counsel for the Commonwealth deny that the Virginia system may be criticized upon this ground but we believe it is clear from the evidence in this case that the relatively minor departures which exist in the Virginia system are occasioned by a legislative attempt to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between thinly populated areas of the state and those having concentrated masses in conformity with the law laid down by this Court in MacDougall and recently reapproved in -- reaffirmed in Baker against Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.714" offset="391272">As we attempted to point out last Thursday, the MacDougall principles were stated by this Court in Baker to constitute several princ -- precedents and to constitute below of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.183" offset="441114">As we understand it, advancement of this reason effectively removes us from the -- without rhyme or reason category of the Solicitor General but presumably impales us upon the opposite form of the dilemma erected by his third postulate that is that the reason advanced does not constitute a permissible purpose of state legislative apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.660" offset="539021">As we understand it, the Solicitor General likened operation of these two principles to the opposing action of a pair of shears, either we do not have a reason or if we do have a reason, it is a legally impermissible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.406" offset="593983">In response to this, we assert that the assurance of a proper diffusion of political initiative between thinly populated areas and those having concentrated masses is as a matter of law, a permissible purpose of state apportionment, one expressly sanctioned by this Court in MacDougall.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.671" offset="675067">Such differ -- since which occur as a result of the diffusion effectively causes the minority or thinly populated areas of the state to be represented in the counsels of Government to prevent such areas from being completely overridden by the sheer weight of numbers while still living to the areas having concentrated masses, the practical opportunity for asserting their weight at the polls which is not available to the thinly populated areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.048" offset="796588">Two aspects of the presentation of the case at bar stand out in connection with this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.638" offset="822920">The first is, we believe that in none of his briefs which he has filed in the various reapportionment cases now under consideration, has the Solicitor General attempted to meet the argument predicated upon MacDougall.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.274" offset="877464">In his brief in the New York case, he brushes the MacDougall principle aside as a generality.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.128" offset="900869">In his compendious brief in the Maryland case, he asserts that MacDougall, despite its citation by various members of this Court in Baker has no application to state reapportionment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.248" offset="949352">And in his brief filed in the case at bar, the Solicitor General does not make any reference to the MacDougall case or even cite it in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.869" offset="983834">And this absence of any reference or citation is highlighted we believe by the fact that in our brief, we advanced the MacDougall principle as being foremost among the principles which are applicable to cases of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.717" offset="1043289">The second aspect we believe is that in reliance upon -- in defense of his position, the Solicitor General relies upon the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas in the MacDougall case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.840" offset="1099713">We therefore think it is unarguably clear that acceptance of the views of the Solicitor General necessarily entails a flat rejection of the MacDougall principle and overruling of the holding of that case and the elevation of the minority view to the position of the majority view.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.986" offset="1180379">The Solicitor General's arguments, we feel cannot be countenance under the existing law as to what may be deemed a proper diffusion of political power between thinly populated and heavily populated areas, counsel for the Commonwealth lack the ability to state dispositively where the outer limits of propriety lie in this field or to articulate the criteria by which these outer limits shall be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.590" offset="1290721">Fortunately, we feel that in the case at bar is it -- it is not necessary for us to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.587" offset="1310783">We take this position only that where a state has so structured its legislature as to achieve a balance, an almost perfect balance between the representation of thinly populated and heavily populated areas, has achieved this balance without giving rise to any population-variance ratio which exceeds that of the Electoral College of the United States and has achieved this balance in a method which causes its state to rank eighth in fairness of representation based solely on population in the United States that such a reapportionment as this clearly constitutes a proper diffusion as to what more or what less may also constitute a proper diffusion, we need not say.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.209" offset="1493222">We do point out however that the reapportionment systems of at least nine states which could not possibly pass most under the rigorous standard that I had just laid down have already been approved in Federal District Courts and in the Supreme Courts of the various states, the States of Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.469" offset="1594264">In these states, the population-variance ratios range from 8-to-1 to 62-to-1 and all of these states are beneath Virginia on the index of representativeness or fairness of representation computed solely on the basis of per capita principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.626" offset="1662913">We therefore submit that if the Virginia reapportionment system is annulled, it necessarily follows that the reapportionment systems of these nine states which rank less fair than Virginia must also be annulled as well are the -- as well as the reapportionment systems of the other 33 states which also have reapportionment systems which are not as fair on a per capita basis as Virginia's.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.241" offset="1765313">We also state that if the Virginia apportionment system is annulled and those are the other nine states is approved, is it not incontestably true that the decisions of the federal courts in these cases will themselves become a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions and will not these opinions form a pattern or a crazy quilt without rational basis laid down by the judiciary rather than by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.700" offset="1887148">We have one other suggestion in connection with our observations and that is that if the principles advocated by the Solicitor General are so fundamental and pervasive as he suggested they are, is it not more than passing strange that Judges Waterman, Levet and Ryan of New York, Judge Weick, Weinmann and Peck of Ohio, Judges Wisdom, West and Ellis of Louisiana, Judge Schnackenberg and Campbell of Illinois, the entire Supreme Court of the State of Idaho and Judges Jones, McCree and Dyer of Florida did not only fail to apply these principles but did not even recognize their existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.463" offset="2054228">With respect to the two technical points, we would like to stress that if the military related population may effectively be removed or excluded in determining the inhabitants of a particular area for the purposes of representation then even under the figures advocated by the Solicitor General, all foundation for any claim by the City of Norfolk that it has been discriminated against by the challenged statutes disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.664" offset="2171047">For under those figure, Norfolk is only slightly underrepresented in the Senate and is indeed actually overrepresented in the House of Delegates of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.665" offset="2211067">We should like to call the Court's attention to what we believe to be fundamental deficiencies in the majority opinion, in that at no point in the majority opinion of the court below, is any reference made to any evidence whatever put in by the defendants in defense of the Virginia reapportionment system.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.733" offset="2283374">Your Honors have seen the record in this case, the latter half of which -- is in -- involves the 11 exhibits which we introduced in support of the Virginia reapportionment system.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.052" offset="2368637">If Your Honor please, the exclusion of the military personnel in those cases substantially reduces the population-variance ratios but they would be as is also true of a number of other Metropolitan areas, underrepresented on a straight per capita basis, viewed only from the per capita basis but the removal of the military personnel from Norfolk would leave Norfolk not even underrepresented on a straight per capita basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.362" offset="2469888">I should like to conclude, if I may, the opening argument on behalf of the Commonwealth by alluding to two observations of the Solicitor General in which we very definitely concur.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.661" offset="2515028">The first of this is on page 45 of his compendious brief in the Maryland case which we have cited on page 21 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.605" offset="2546792">In this connection, the Solicitor General uses a following language, "The Court is not to exercise the legislative function of choosing between alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.082" offset="2584722">Still greater deference may be due the people of a state when exercising the sovereign function of shaping their own governmental institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.351" offset="2621816">The postulates of federalism also argue that in this area, the national judiciary must take care to allow full scope for local self-government."</text>
            <text syncTime="641.808" offset="2671658">We could not agree more but we suspect that the Solicitor General, despite these words attempts to leave Virginia very little room for local self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.301" offset="2717633">In his brief in this particular case, the Attorney General has -- the Solicitor General has commented upon the results of the Virginia system in the following language which we have set out on page 22 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.828" offset="2763713">In this connection, he says, "The evidence also show that measured simply by the percentage of population required to elect a majority in each house of the legislature, Virginia ranks well up on the list of well-apportioned states," and so Virginia does if Your Honors please and so Virginia does.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.429" offset="2866113">With the permission of the Chief Justice, counsel for the Commonwealth will retain the balance of their allotted time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.385" offset="3945911">This complaint of Virginia citizens against invidious discrimination now before this Court is -- is not a new one for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.823" offset="3979661">Thomas Jefferson in 1781, in his notes on Virginia, federally complained about the apportionment of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.405" offset="4018009">Even at that time he said, "The County of Warwick with only 100 fighting men has an equal representation with the County of Lawton which has 1746."</text>
            <text syncTime="989.158" offset="4061059">And then he said, "It will appear that 19,000 men living below the falls of the river that is in Tidewater possessed eighth of the Senate and want four members only of possessing the majority of the House of Delegates."</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.703" offset="4119259">This 19,000 therefore, living in one part of the country give a lot of up rates of 30,000 living in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.598" offset="4150815">Mr. Jefferson didn't like malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.404" offset="4161996">He didn't also -- he also did not like the exclusion of fighting men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.015" offset="4184461">If I may, if the Court please, I would like to -- at this point to rush in where the Solicitor General has -- has feared to thread.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.728" offset="4223331">I would like to ask this Court to accept four propositions which I believe will be of great assistance to the District Courts in solving this -- not a problem, this political thicket that -- it does now exist and which I believe this Court might properly accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.801" offset="4299609">The first preposition is one which I believe the Court has already accepted and that is that a citizen's right to be protected from arbitrary or capricious debasement of his votes, a vote is one which is secured by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whether it's implicit or explicit in Baker or -- and in Gray against Sanders, I -- I believe it is a -- a ruling of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.707" offset="4551220">That is that we must start with the proposition which Mr. Jefferson again stated in a letter to General William King, the first Governor of Maine in 1819 on the occasion of the admission of Maine to the union, that equal representation is so fundamental a principle in a two republic that no prejudice can justify its violation because it prejudices themselves cannot be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.092" offset="4652784">I -- I would ask the Court to -- to adopt the principle set forth in this magnificent classic brief of Mr. John McConnell filed in Alabama on a subject of the fundamental principle of equal representation in a republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.448" offset="4722166">It is -- it's an outstanding document, I never saw it and never met Mr. McConnell until we came to this -- this Court but it is -- is well worth the -- the careful consideration of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.496" offset="4762394">In a principal here that in a democracy, affirmative government must be government by all majority, that the minority is protected by the -- by the Bill of Rights and by such other restrictions as the Court may impose but that if you haven't and this is in response to Mr. Justice White's question of the other day, if you have a choice between tyranny by a majority and tyranny by a minority, we must always take tyranny by a majority because the minority has in its power at any moment the power to overthrow the majority and become itself a majority, and if the protections of the minority are protections not in the range of affirmative government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.035" offset="4936579">We should not give minorities in either House affirmative government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.618" offset="4950894">We should give them the protections -- restrictions against abuse by a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.523" offset="4974508">I -- I submit that that is a -- a -- a fundamental principle that if -- that fundamentally, government must function and that government may properly function only by a majority vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.450" offset="5022156">The government in any state is more than its legislative assembly and what if a state is through the historical working out of an equilibrium of political forces in the various aspects of its government has worked out a system where there's no possibility of tyranny by anybody, isn't that a -- isn't that preferable, the tyranny by a majority or a minority?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edmund D. Campbell</label>
            <text syncTime="1252.478" offset="5114316">Certainly Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.194" offset="5121212">But I think that if you give for example the voters in one House of a bicameral legislature, give the minority what -- regardless of what minority it may be, the right to exercise affirmative government by classifying it other than on the basis of population, you have destroyed to that extent the republic and I'll give your -- give Your Honor a specific example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.990" offset="5216402">If we prefer the thinly populated areas as Mr. McIlwaine has suggested that Virginia has done but which I will show to Your Honors it has not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.352" offset="5253810">If we prefer the thinly populated areas, we are giving a preference to voters in a pastoral community one way, one reason or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.143" offset="5296964">We are -- if we prefer -- if we make a property qualification, we are giving a -- an -- additional, I mean a -- a separate kind of classification whatever kind of minority you choose for this -- of a House if it be -- if one House be on population and the other one be on some other basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.485" offset="5358299">What other -- whatever kind of minority you choose, you are choosing it on the basis of sex, on the basis of property, on the basis of wealth, on the basis of occupation, on the basis of residents, on the basis of place of business or some other kind of -- of -- of basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.926" offset="5412112">But whatever basis that is, it -- it gives to minority a special class of minority and affirmative government right in its minority should not have, I submit that affirmative government right but only a check upon the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.058" offset="5468641">Now, if I am correct in that principle and -- and I submit that this is fundamental in a republic and Mr. Jefferson again said it was fundamental in a republic and to the extent that a government departed from it in any frame -- in any phase of its -- of its operations to that extent, it is no longer a true republic and my colleague Mr. Howell has cited that in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.306" offset="5569578">The third proposition is that the right of undiluted political franchise is a transcendent right using a footnote, they were the language in a footnote in Gray against Sanders somewhat akin to the right of free speech.Somewhat akin to the right of citizen to be secure against physical mutilation as in the Skinner against Oklahoma case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.602" offset="5674799">And if we once proved or if -- if there is a substantial variation from equality in population then the burden, contrary to the usual situation in classifications then the burden shifts upon the state to show a rational basis for that classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.576" offset="5766750">I -- I urge this Court to adopt that -- that proposition that the right of political franchise is a -- in a sense a transcendent right closely akin to the right of free speech and that if we depart from equality of population and representation then the burden is upon those who assert the rationality of it to give a rational basis and the reason for that Your Honors is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.771" offset="5867478">They are -- they are cases as Your Honors know coming from all parts of the country on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.326" offset="5893705">The minimum standards which this Court lays down for reapportionment are up to be the maximum standards followed by the states who are requested or required to make reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.163" offset="5965072">It is -- it is of the utmost importance that -- that this Court lay down a standard and I trust it would of equal population with a burden upon this state to show a rational basis for a departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.510" offset="6026407">Judge Bryan in his masterful opinion in the District Court said, "Plaintiffs have proved the inequity of the allotment of representatives on the basis of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.198" offset="6065173">They are upon the burden to adduce evidence of the presence of other factors which might explain this disproportion passed to the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.619" offset="6090877">I -- I submit that is a -- that is an appropriate position for the Court to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.598" offset="6110835">And lastly, the fourth proposition I ask this Court to accept is that a legislative classification must be rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.983" offset="6136330">If there be any classification against the -- the equal population factor, it must be rational, it must be based on -- it must not be designed to favor any group of persons by a reason of their residence, their occupation, their color, their sex, their wealth or their place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.199" offset="6209160">That would -- that would do away the classifications of farmers against city dwellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.416" offset="6234028">It would do away the -- of the classification of people in the -- in industry or people who are not in industry or people in professions who are not in professions or classifications based on civilian against military or classifications based on large geographical areas or smaller geographical areas because area -- acres don't vote, it's on the persons that vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.547" offset="6314590">Or classifications that are based purely on governmental units as such and the reason for this is that governmental units within a state have no sovereignty but are purely preachers of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.388" offset="6373940">The -- particularly is that true in the state of Virginia where the counties and the cities are purely preachers of the legislature and where the legislature of Virginia can do as it did to Arlington when Arlington stated that it would comply with the rulings of this Court in Brown against Board of Education and desegregated schools, the legislature within 30 days took away the Elective School Board that Arlington was very proud of and -- and required that School Board to be appointed by other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.687" offset="6511135">It -- it is a -- it's a great importance to -- to any community in a state such as Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.519" offset="6542482">Now within this framework, as Judge Bryan again said and I -- I suggest that this might a -- a proper holding for this Court that the state may consider compactness and conti -- contiguity of territory, community of interest of the people, observance of natural lines and conformity to historic provisions such as county lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.860" offset="6627850">There again though the burden is on the state when Judge Bryan said, "Additionally, of course we must accept this to establish such reasons for the redistricting as a fairly conceivable or impairable from the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.160" offset="6672990">If the Court would accept -- would adopt those standards, it could give to the District Courts a basis on which they could proceed to what themselves out of this political thicket and by which this Court could then proceed to hear cases when necessary on the merits on a basis of acceptance to the -- to the general principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.267" offset="6765464">This, I take it would also -- if -- if the Court should accept this, it would also take care of Mr. Mays' argument which he made to this Court on the doctrine of abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.718" offset="6803289">If a -- if the right to vote is a transcendent vote, it is or in any event it is protected under the Civil Rights Act and should -- and Mr. Mays' argument I -- I trust should be disposed of by the recent decision of this Court in McNeese against the Board of Education just a few months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.005" offset="6872461">Here in Virginia, there are no strands of local law woven into this case which could possibly move to federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.276" offset="6909450">There's no question, for instance, of the boundary between Alexandria and Arlington or the boundaries between one community and another which might be a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.708" offset="6947276">The issue is purely one of Equal Protection under the Federal Constitution and the fact that these plaintiffs may or may not have a remedy in a state court under McNeese is completely immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.577" offset="7002655">Mr. Mays suggested and sought to distinguish between the voting right cases or distinguish these voting right cases from the segregation cases by saying that in segregation cases involved only plucking out an individual child and not the state governments as such whereas the voting right cases interfere with state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.832" offset="7079769">Mr. Mays has forgotten, (Inaudible) has forgotten, Jackson, he has forgotten, Cooper against Aaron, he has forgotten the -- the -- he -- he does not know what he says when he says that because the voting right cases I suggest to Your Honors, do not involve great social customs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.892" offset="7171929">It involves a -- a -- decision in the voting right case, this involves only a single surgical operation if you please, because once this legislature is correctly apportioned, once the matter is taken cared of by the judiciary or by the legislature as I hope the legislatures would in most instances take care of it, the people themselves are grateful and I suggest to Your Honors that the effect of reapportionment in state cases -- in state legislatures will be not to take away state rights or state powers but rather to restore the states to their primary functions because it will permit the states to conduct affirmative government sought by the majority and not simply to conduct negative government at the will of rural minorities or other minorities who do not wish services or other actions taken by our services given or other actions taken by the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.585" offset="12538734">There is no locality and no state that has greater need for the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment than Norfolk in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.381" offset="12573947">In the short time that I have, I intend to direct my attention to reemphasize the rank raw discrimination that was perpetrated upon the people of Norfolk by the statutes under attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.452" offset="12626192">And to eliminate once and for all, I hope, the mirage of rationalization, any mirage in rationalization that the argument of the Attorney General of Virginian may have created with reference to eliminating from consideration any right of representation on behalf of citizens who have the military for an occupation and who have always constituted an important part of the population of the City of Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.764" offset="12735488">I'll go to a fundamental that we are here with an affirmative opinion from a three-judge federal court written by Judge Albert V. Bryan of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, who has been bred and born in the tradition of Virginia, who has served as Commonwealth's attorney of the city of Alexander for well over a decade, who has appeared on constitutional questions before the Supreme Court of Appeals who is specially appointed to counsel and who, as I say, was learned in the traditions of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.504" offset="12866414">And I think that we should go to some of the facts on which the lower court relied in handing down that opinion, namely that insofar as Norfolk is concerned, when the legislature refused to constitute a sturdy commission of its own body after it adjourned, Governor Allman (ph) had to appoint a special study commission so that they might have time to consider the complexities of reapportioning and re -- redistricting the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.040" offset="12980517">That was composed of learned lay people and learned legislators from all over Virginia from representative sections throughout the wheat and bread for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.854" offset="13019805">They in turn permission the Bureau of Public Administration of the University of Virginia to give impartial consideration to these problems and the Bureau of Public Administration came up with two plans for the Senate, Senate plan A and B and both of those plans awarded Norfolk a third Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.935" offset="13096187">It came up with three alternative plans for the House of Delegates, plans A, B and C for the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.828" offset="13119697">And in each of those plans, Norfolk was awarded an additional delegate to raise us to seven based upon an increase in population of a little in excess of 90,000 during the 10-year period from 1950 to 1960 when the Hoover Commission, the name of the delegate who headed the commission was Mr. Lawrence Hoover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.393" offset="13201930">When the Hoover Commission went over these plans of the Bureau of Public Administration, they took a little of assault, took political realities and they (Inaudible) down the per capita representation but even with that political assaulting out of the Hoover Commission, came a recommendation firm and clear that Norfolk was entitled to a third Senator and a seventh delegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.318" offset="13305689">Those overpowering facts from considered members of both the lay and the legislature cannot be blinked at on appeal by the Attorney General of Virginia, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.421" offset="13358038">Now I want to get swiftly and quickly to the rankness and the rawness, I submit, of the discrimination perpetrated upon the City of Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.332" offset="13397744">Each of Norfolk's two Senators represent roughly 152,000 people and the adjacent City of Chesapeake, only 73,000 people are necessary to give them an additional Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.440" offset="13454169">Now the -- for example a Norfolk delegate represents 50,000 people and a delegate from Shenandoah represents only 21,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.927" offset="13492099">This discrimination with respect to the people of Norfolk is underlined by the fact that a community which has twice the influence in the State Senate is immediately adjacent to the City of Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.963" offset="13536298">How more invidious can discrimination be than where a neighbor Jones residing in Norfolk realizes that the common fence he shares with his neighbor in the City of Chesapeake marks a line of demarcation for political influence which exceeds his by more than 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.208" offset="13605261">Bringing it down even clearer, if we could conceive that Congress would decree that Justice Harlan should be paid $40,000 a year and Justice Stewart $20,000 a year merely because of the seats that they occupy before this Honored Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3417.562" offset="13774639">Two weeks ago, our City Council had to go to the bank and borrow money to run our public school system waiting for the taxes to be raised because Virginia governmental-wise has withered to a philosophy known as pay-as-you-go and the state's out of debt but the cities are in debt over their head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.104" offset="13856768">We wanted to have a payroll tax in Norfolk so that the people living in Chesapeake and working in Norfolk would have to pay a portion of our tax and so that the people living in Princess Anne on the City of Virginia Beach and working in Norfolk would have to pay a part of that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.505" offset="13922388">We had to get that through the legislature in order to have payroll tax in the league of -- the league of counties which only includes two cities, that's Chesapeake and Virginia Beach, they're only two cities allowed in that league and that league says, "No, we won't vote for any payroll tax."</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.486" offset="13990306">That's the protection of the economic selfishness of each individual but it just shows you that we've got to go at alone and we badly need every green button that we can get in the General Assembly of Virginia and I -- I want to emphasize that we're talking about our very real thing and that each year that it goes by, that we are out-weighted 2-to-1 and our representation means this, that tomorrow, a special session of Virginia General Assembly convenes for the people that I represent in Norfolk with great majority or against a poll tax which is locked in political control in Virginia for over half a century where only 30% of the adults bothered to go to the polls tomorrow when -- to -- Wednesday, I think the Governor expects to have the public hearings and everything ready for it to roll and we need desperately to have a green button added to our delegates so that seven buttons will show in the House of Delegates and three buttons will show in the Senate as we try to do away with the -- with the poll tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3925.221" offset="15805294">And we would have shown them that by judicial decree, we were permitted to annex a portion of Princess Anne County and took in 38,000 people and they are the 90,000 people that we need to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.017" offset="15856494">People that we have annexed from our adjacent territories in order to give us oddly room in which to grow as a large municipal -- municipality there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.552" offset="15902574">And then I would hastily move on, if Your Honor please, to show you that our entire history and tradition has been to count the military and it appalls me to -- to hear the Attorney General of Virginia suggest that we haven't -- in 9th -- traditionally and historically, Virginia responding to the roots of Thomas Jefferson and those early founding fathers have used population as the keystone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.425" offset="16010094">All those legislators in recent years, population was not so stable as it was and they're becoming more reluctant to hue to those well established historic principles but in 1922, Norfolk got an additional delegate based upon our total population established by the United States and its census including military population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.134" offset="16096925">In 1950, the legislature refused to reapportion it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.887" offset="16119912">They went home and Governor Battle, had to call a special session because the people of the state rows up and say, "You cannot blink at this mandate."</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.600" offset="16154812">They came back and our now present Governor, Albertis Harrison, was then a State Senator who had served on the redistricting the committee and he recommended that Norfolk receive an additional delegate in 1952, 30 years since we've gotten anything in 1922 and he cited as the figure to justify this increase, the total population census is established by the United States Census and in that special session, we got an additional delegate based upon our total population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.736" offset="16283335">And now, it seems somewhat contradictory that his Attorney General is saying that we shouldn't have now what we have had in 1922 and -- and 1952.</text>

            <text syncTime="4549.798" offset="18303540">Our position in this Virginia case is that the decision of the court below is correct and should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.624" offset="18346904">I want to devote myself very briefly if I can to two or three of the points that have been raised with particular reference to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.699" offset="18391207">First, I'd like to direct myself to the question of abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.796" offset="18407612">This is the only case in which it has been argued and indeed the only case in which it could be argued that -- equitable doctrine of abstention applies and that the court below should not have preceded to an adjudication of merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.796" offset="18471560">It could not have been argued in the other cases, in the Maryland case because it was in the state court, the best reason of all.</text>

            <text syncTime="4618.628" offset="18578871">Yes and I -- I suppose -- used unfortunate words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.945" offset="18592141">What I meant to say is that there could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.310" offset="18601650">Now, the plaintiffs could have had no recourse to a cause of action founded upon state law to secure the kind of redress that they were seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.661" offset="18643028">I think that's really what I meant when I said there was no state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.287" offset="18661522">In the Alabama case, the Alabama Supreme Court had apparently held on several occasions that it could do nothing about this and therefore, there was no chance of obtaining a remedy in the Alabama Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.847" offset="18715752">Also that case that perhaps above all, in view of the issues raised about the interpretation of the Alabama Constitution would be one where the argument might have been appropriate whereas not for those persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.801" offset="18767579">We submit that in this instance, the District Court was plainly right in adjudicating the case of the merits because no ground of abstention that was made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.998" offset="18824422">As we read the cases, there are two grounds on which a federal court of equity may properly abstain from passing upon a claim raised under the Federal Constitution or under other federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.061" offset="18880637">The first is where a question involving the construction of the state law is bound up with or perhaps antecedent to the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.380" offset="18921911">In such a case of course, for the federal court to go ahead, it may be deciding a hypothetical case because it may adopt the construction of the state law that that state courts will not adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.382" offset="18973947">It maybe deciding a constitutional question that there would be no occasion to decide if the state court can speak first and for both reasons, this Court has held and the lower courts followed the view that they should abstain unless some reason of contrary appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.564" offset="19042701">We have no quarrel with principle but no such question is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.522" offset="19066525">The state law under which the election officials would proceed unless enjoined is perfectly clear, there is no dispute about its meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.672" offset="19111037">There is no dispute about the meaning of any provision of the Virginia Constitution because there is none that bears even arguably upon this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.967" offset="19160252">And consequently, but one word more, the reference in Judge Bryan's opinion where he says that in Virginia, population is undoubtedly debased is not a reference to any requirement of the Virginia Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.754" offset="19231410">It's a reference to what in fact has undoubtedly happened over the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.817" offset="19255651">And there again, everything he said seems to me consistent with the view that I've expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.249" offset="19281356">There is no antecedent question of state law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.924" offset="19300059">Now the second ground on which this Court has held to the lower court and this Court might abstain from deciding a federal question, a federal constitutional question, is that there is a state remedy based upon state law which makes it unnecessary to decide the federal constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.295" offset="19385532">We've suggested in our brief that that doctrine is not applicable where the suit is founded upon the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.667" offset="19427015">And it seems to us that the decisions in the Monroe and Pape and in the McNeese case sustained that proposition and with it, we would argue that they were right, that the aim of the Civil Rights Act was to give one who alleged the deprivation of Federal Constitutional Rights a -- and a remedy in the federal court because it was believed that the federal remedy would be more effective or at least might be more effective than some alternative state remedy even though very possibly they're based upon the state law but I don't have to go that far here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.921" offset="19576121">Here there is no suggestion that there is any remedy based upon the State Constitution but no one has suggested any provision of the State Constitution that this apportionment violates but not even by the wildest stretch of the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.197" offset="19649160">Any remedy that exists is a remedy for a violation of the Federal Constitution and certainly there is no occasion and no one has ever suggested that a federal court should defer to a state court in enforcing a -- if in a suit to enforce a Federal Constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.343" offset="19729721">The plea for abstention let this go to the state legislature, let's see what the state courts will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.511" offset="19762427">It seems to me simply a plea that the federal court not adjudicate whether the plaintiff's have Constitutional Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.029" offset="19796490">And I'm not aware of any decision or any consideration that would support that position.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="5077.280" offset="20413503">That seems to me that the guarantee of equal protection of the law -- there is none in the Virginia Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.770" offset="20443491">I -- it does have a more specific meaning as applied here and as applied to the distinctions that some of these apportionments have tried to make between people then a constitution that has no substantive guarantees that are applicable to these problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.704" offset="20527188">Coming to the merits, I think it is important to emphasize the nature of the claim made here by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.586" offset="20574730">The claim is not so loose as that Virginia has an unrepresentative legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.066" offset="20604615">It's a claim that there is discrimination against three specific areas, a city, a county on the city and the county that is either capricious in the sense that those areas have been discriminated against for no reason whatever or that its invidious in the sense that they have been singled out for adverse treatment because something in the character of their population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.424" offset="20726136">There is no question I take it on the facts that there is this kind of discrimination against Arlington, Norfolk and Fairfax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.261" offset="20765424">To mention just one figure, Fairfax has only three delegates in the Virginia House of Representative of where on any population base, it would be entitled to seven, more than twice as many and in the Senate too which underrepresented, it has only two but it would be entitled to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.129" offset="20840866">And while I think the most extreme case, it's equally clear that there is this kind of discrimination against Arlington and the City of Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.749" offset="20883393">Now I stress that this is a capricious or invidious discrimination against the people of those specific areas because that, it seems to me is the answer to counsel's argument that Virginia's legislature on the whole is pretty representative much more so than in many state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.642" offset="20963015">Where the claim is that there is capricious or invidious discrimination against a substantial group of people then it's no answer to say, "Well, we come out pretty well in terms of the number of -- in terms of the population base required to elect the minimum number of the majority of the legislature."</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.530" offset="21070535">In this respect, it seems to me that Mr. Campbell was absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.262" offset="21093418">One can illustrate the point, and I think so that it's clear beyond dispute by a very simple example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.688" offset="21127168">Suppose if one can -- imagines a state of a 150,000 people with 15 counties, all of which are equal again in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.859" offset="21175860">10 of them have two representative districts, I'm imagining a unicameral legislature with 5000 people in each and five have only one district with 10,000 people in it, the whole county.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.586" offset="21234792">So that those people have half the representation on per capita basis of the other counties unless my arithmetic is badly wrong, it would take representatives elected by half the people of my imaginary county, exactly half, to constitute a majority in my imagine -- unicameral legislature if there is not the slightest doubt that there would be a -- a denial of equal protection to the people of the five counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.934" offset="21356105">And so here, the fact that it takes about 40% in each House of the Virginia -- of the population of Virginia to elect the majority in each House seems to me to be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.306" offset="21409604">That put this in the general terms and in terms of the basic propositions that I've argued to the court in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.810" offset="21455684">I think it is irrelevant how high or low a state ranks on the list of the smallest major -- smallest percentage of the population needed to elect the majority of the legislature so long as one is talking in terms of either by our second or a third proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.495" offset="21554427">That is to say when you're talking about a capricious discrimination or an invidious discrimination, one not directed at a permissible legislative purpose in terms of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.857" offset="21611792">Then I think that it's immaterial of what is the balance of power in a state legislature of those people are being denied equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.034" offset="21648572">When one comes to our fourth proposition and says that the inequalities are so gross and the sub -- submerging of principle of majority rule or popular will is so great that even though the legislature -- that even though the law has a permissible function and unreasonable balance has been strung, then it would seem to me that considerations such as this do come into play because in determining whether the plaintiffs have been denied equal protection of the law, our proposition refers one to the overall situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.527" offset="21806456">I would say the same thing is true and this is one reason I mentioned it, about such considerations as whether there is -- that Constitution may be changed by initiative and referendum or whether it was recently adopted by popular vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.517" offset="21874479">If the basic proposition to which one refers, to determine whether there's violation of the Equal Protection Clause is in terms of the degree that there's a permissible purpose but an impermissible balance has been strung but then I think those factors may come into operation but not in terms, as I say of our second and third proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.739" offset="21971341">Then may I address myself very briefly in the two or three minutes remaining to MacDougall against Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.491" offset="22022332">In MacDougall and Green, the court said, and half way out, misplaced the brief I was -- here it is."</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.068" offset="22060680">That a state may assure to measure it -- to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those county having concentrated masses that this was something permissible for the state to do."</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.428" offset="22126090">I would emphasize here something which I think has been overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.535" offset="22142495">MacDougall and Green was talking about how you nominate candidates for a statewide office by a petition, nominating petition and the language that is so often quoted speaks in terms of assuring a diffusion of political initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.746" offset="22219400">I take it, it was talking the business of getting signatures on a nominating petition and what was said that is that you may require signatures from all around the state and not just from Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.206" offset="22281258">Well, if you're talking about candidates for statewide office, that is a -- it's -- and you're talking about people not running from one of the recognized parties in order to make sure that the ballot isn't just being clattered up by a lot of very popular local, people who were popular locally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.796" offset="22351579">It would be calculated to assure fairness in the election to see that there were some strength all through the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.567" offset="22390659">And I think that that interpretation is confirmed by the fact that in the latter part of the sentence, the Court referred to the practical opportunities for exerting their political weight which it possessed by people in the cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.741" offset="22451367">That's much easier to collect signatures in the city than it is to collect signatures out in the rural areas just because that more people there and there closer together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.342" offset="22497761">I cannot believe that MacDougall and Green was meant to say or that it does say that it is proper to weigh the importance to be given in the votes, the votes of one area against the importance to be given the votes in some other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.821" offset="22587726">Certainly, no such question was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.283" offset="22597548">Certainly, the reference to political initiative is not appropriate for that purpose and I would say as I argued last week that certainly to this extent, the decision -- the argument is contrary to Gray and Sanders that I think what --</text>

            <text syncTime="5695.591" offset="22886776">One final point, very briefly, with respect to the military population or military-related population in the counties.</text>

            <text syncTime="5907.482" offset="23734293">It's -- it's on the basis of inclusion of military of sorts, I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.239" offset="23745369">It was the outside figure on population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.794" offset="23759579">Now if I may take a moment or two further on abstention, I -- I brought that to -- to Your Honors' attention in two aspects, one, a rather narrow one and one, a much broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.174" offset="23801062">The narrow one was that you can take Virginia Constitution which may seem perfectly plain and you make take the Sections 24 in which seem perfectly plain but you have to lay them beside other things in the Constitution too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.928" offset="23864069">Now, in saving time, I made a general reference to our brief but I call your attentions specifically now to two provisions of our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.735" offset="23903357">When George Mason wrote it and has been copied all over the world and the Bill of Rights of our Constitution became the first 10 amendments in different language of the Constitution of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.955" offset="23948184">We ratified it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.778" offset="23951527">We didn't want to lose the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.459" offset="23958215">We ratified it in order to have a union but we have gentlemen's agreement to put the Amendments in as the first 10 Amendments of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.141" offset="23988935">That was agreed by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.628" offset="23998861">And Mason said, "That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights."</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.770" offset="24023521">What does that mean when we put it beside Section 43?</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.611" offset="24034806">I don't know what our Court would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5984.861" offset="24043792">Again, Section 63, subsection 18 of our Constitution provides and, "The General Assembly shall not enact any local special or private law granting to any individual any special right, privilege or immunity."</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.160" offset="24097081">How will they construe that against 43?</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.095" offset="24104814">I don't know and I say that should be given a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.502" offset="24122368">But it was beyond that that I went in saying that -- that here, we have a peculiar case for abstention because at this instance, we are not simply giving a right to an individual or rather not giving a right but we are -- we are seeing that he gets it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6019.040" offset="24180569">But we are going inside of the state and changing its very machinery of government in order to accomplish a result and I say therefore, that we -- when we apply Baker to that state of facts, we have to do it with the greatest caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.862" offset="24227798">Now I know that McNeese has been cited here and when I first saw it, I was troubled by it but when I analyzed it, I wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.235" offset="24257369">McNesse was a case in which you had an integration situation in Illinois of all places and not the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="6044.774" offset="24283491">And you had waited nine years to get that thing of a (Inaudible) and you still haven't done it in the North.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.950" offset="24304180">And you went after them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6051.692" offset="24311181">I have no (Inaudible) about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.486" offset="24318391">What I'm talking about here is, we have a case of first impression dealing with the voting situation in which you are laying your hand on the internal machinery of government and I think there, the Court should show restraint when it comes to a state like Virginia which has come close, not perfect and I appreciated Mr. Justice Goldberg's observation, "Why aren't you perfect Virginia?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.495" offset="24398326">You didn't ask that question of anybody else and I was very flattered that he had asked it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.249" offset="24417343">So I think it McNeese here is --</text>

            <text syncTime="6095.029" offset="24484530">So much of that, if I -- I may, I -- before I leave that observation the Attorney General though, I -- I want to point and I don't think it unfair to him for me to do that his views on that had been very interesting during the course of this summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.376" offset="24541895">I think it's not improper to make this reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.818" offset="24551717">On July the first, he appeared in Seattle before the Attorneys General and all the Attorneys General present familiar with the language he had used and I quote it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.392" offset="24589960">He had just said, "That in the view of the purest, in the purest view, it ought to be one vote for one -- one man, one vote", but there he said, and I quote exactly."</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.787" offset="24643563">Nevertheless there is much to be said against the purest view.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.539" offset="24658505">It seems wholly inconsistent with our history and practice is almost in so founding of the colonies."</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.534" offset="24682538">It would assert that well over half the states have been violating the Fourteenth Amendment continuously since its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.305" offset="24705630">It would require the total reconstitution of at least two-thirds of the state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.994" offset="24724334">It would leave no room for local autonomy and matters of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.670" offset="24743037">Perhaps -- perhaps, I shall later find myself arguing for the principle but time was (Inaudible) that at least today, I wonder whether in the face of his considerations --</text>

            <text syncTime="6182.422" offset="24834048">At least today, I wonder whether in the face of these considerations, the Fourteenth Amendment could fairly be held to lay down so rigid a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.188" offset="24877098">And again, we will say we couldn't agree with him more than when he made that particular observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6198.831" offset="24899772">And I recall too that he said on page 44 of the brief in Alabama case, "Any reapportionment honored by a court is a poor substitute for one of the people's own making."</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.728" offset="24963302">Now, what the Solicitor General, I don't need to bow down on him entirely I'll get to the others if I have time but the Solicitor General here has held that, in the Maryland brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.541" offset="25026518">He has held out to you that there should be one man one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6236.203" offset="25049192">He said that's the general principle to keep in mind but what he says to you after that is Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.577" offset="25070717">One man, one vote is really the real thing, that's the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.889" offset="25087958">I don't ask you to -- to enunciate it, no -- no, don't leave them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.985" offset="25104363">Just keep it in the back oh your head some place and keeping it there, declare all of these states violative of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.063" offset="25140621">What he is suggesting to you is that you have in the back of your heads a system of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="6264.665" offset="25163086">He has named one, this is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.361" offset="25173849">And that you would just keep them in mind and knock these states out without having any guidelines set forth to all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.547" offset="25202584">That's exactly what it amounts to in the simplest kind of lay English.</text>
            <text syncTime="6279.140" offset="25220974">There of course, he couldn't ask it to having a fixed rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6283.209" offset="25237274">No political side has -- can say 25% is right, why not 26, why not 30, why not 18, why not 16 and two-thirds?</text>
            <text syncTime="6290.655" offset="25267054">You can't do it like that and if this Court, may I say, if this Court would attempt it and say "We will allow this much permissibility."</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.308" offset="25297669">It would not be a judicial function, it will be a legislative function and assume as you do that to the extent that you do it, you are denying Republican Government the form of Government under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution, the very thing that we assured we must have and you can't legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.688" offset="25375096">I have so little time for the rest but I must hit a few things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.136" offset="25388889">Mr. Jefferson is true with all the soldiers that we are now but all the soldiers in Jefferson's day in Virginia were Virginia soldiers called from the (Inaudible) in Connecticut when there was talks in the sound of a revolution and they all went back to the (Inaudible) to harvest the crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.511" offset="25446463">We didn't have any outsiders so the company of a 100 North Carolinians came in, in the French and Indian wall and we didn't see any others until the eve of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.032" offset="25476556">Well, we are talking here about an entirely different thing when we speak of enormous numbers of very fine young men who come into our community for limited time and go.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.944" offset="25516157">And there's nothing in the record to show how many registered but it is notorious in our state that very few do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.735" offset="25543325">As a matter of fact, we've had a situation in it too in the history of this country where a man never did vote until he was running for the president itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.252" offset="25581359">Now, I was -- a question was asked, "What about Shenandoah County?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6374.568" offset="25602675">I don't know whether that question was rhetorical or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6377.379" offset="25613960">It has a small vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.152" offset="25620961">Why so small?</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.920" offset="25628066">Now, just to point out to you that Virginia is not gerrymandering, Shenandoah County has a Republican there who comes to our General Assembly or regularly in votes to Republican view and we have not attempted to gerrymander him out of his representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.883" offset="25683968">And if you look below Richmond of the County of Chesterfield, you will find that that is probably has -- has much malapportionment as any and that's a good loyal Democratic County and we haven't tried to do anything especially for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6407.285" offset="25733496">And we of course have a -- a democratic state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.002" offset="25752409">Now, reference was made to the Richmond situation and we say you got eight representatives here for Richmond and -- and Chesapeake and Henrico County which surrounds it in one voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.286" offset="25805490">The reason for that is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.008" offset="25816461">You see, you can't sit here and not know 50 states thoroughly and pass on this, you can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.961" offset="25840285">In Richmond and Henrico County, we are now in the process we hope of annexing a good part of Henrico County to the City of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.324" offset="25869646">And the General Assembly which made that possible -- which made that possible anticipated this by setting up the new representation to that fashion and that same General Assembly found -- that same General Assembly found that there was underrepresentation in the counties in the Northern part of the state and it is overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.021" offset="25956477">That 1962 -- has overlooked it at 1962, Virginia gave Fairfax a new senator and it gave Fairfax a new delegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.925" offset="26000050">So the argument that these people would never give any of their power vanishes in the light of what they actually did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.048" offset="26020634">We did in apportion -- gave both of them more representation in both House.</text>
            <text syncTime="6491.911" offset="26072043">Now, it maybe from the map, some may say that the crazy quilt -- sorry sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.905" offset="26095971">Thank you very much.</text>
