            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="32.095" offset="231737">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.261" offset="244381">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Alabama Court of Appeals which is the intermediate appellate court in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.218" offset="280221">Petitioner asserts denial of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.340" offset="308746">The Alabama Court of Appeals ruled against him and the Alabama Supreme Court refused to review the case on the ground that petitioner's petition was filed on the wrong-sized paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.915" offset="359006">That is an ordinary legal cap paper instead of the folio paper which is in this record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.710" offset="394219">Petitioner was convicted in the Circuit Court of the Tenth Judicial Circuit for violating Section 856 of the Birmingham City Code which is set forth on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.485" offset="441344">And this provision briefly provides that any person who knowingly opposes or resists any officer in executing or attempting to make any lawful arrest or in the discharge of any legal duty, and so forth, shall, on conviction, be punished as -- for a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.989" offset="527339">The charge brought against petitioner was essentially in the language of the ordinance and the charge appears on page 4 of our brief and it charge that petitioner did knowingly and willfully interfere with and hinder the Chief of Police in the discharge of his legal duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.487" offset="601318">The Alabama Court of Appeals, however, affirmed on the ground, as petitioner reads it, that it did not have to reach the question of whether petitioner violated Section 856 because, as appears on page 60 of the record, it held, he had violated another section, Section 825, which we -- with which he had never been charged and that is the Section making an assault of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.853" offset="706748">And it said that in as much as Shuttlesworth blocked the Chief's path using words from which the intent to do so in rudeness or anger could probably and rationally be inferred, there was no error in his conviction since he could have been clearly convicted of a simple assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.976" offset="779264">The petitioner's first conviction here is that there is no evidence to sustain the conviction below and that is no evidence either under Section 856 because petitioner, first of all, we submit, did not interfere with anyone and secondly, we submit, the police were not in the exercise of any lawful duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.754" offset="882395">And third, if the question of the crime of assault is in the case, as it was raised for the first time in the Alabama Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.973" offset="915310">There was no assault under Alabama law as it has been stated heretofore because, as we read the Alabama cases, there is either a requirement of violence or an -- an attempt to commit violence of some sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.121" offset="967868">Or under the Alabama law of assault, as it has been defined for the first time in this case as involving some ingredient of rudeness and anger because on this record, in the words of the State's own witnesses, there was neither rudeness nor anger.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.621" offset="1037876">Well, I was just about to come to that, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.198" offset="1048116">The facts are not seriously disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.297" offset="1056580">There is some slight dispute between the parties but, for purposes of this argument, we will accept the statement of the facts as given by the police and most favorable to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.216" offset="1096286">May 17th, 1961, the Freedom Riders, which I believe need not be further described as the well-recognized acts that occurred around that time, the Freedom Riders were in the Birmingham bus terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.886" offset="1154905">Some of them had come from Nashville to Birmingham and were on route to Montgomery, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.654" offset="1174026">Some of the Freedom Riders were Birmingham residents and they were joining the national group and they were going to Montgomery, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.031" offset="1211538">All of the group had tickets, including the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.410" offset="1221047">He had a ticket and he had a suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.200" offset="1232123">The Chief of Police came up to the group, and on page 15 and 16 of the record, what he said appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.438" offset="1261171">I'll rapidly go through his testimony, he said, "When I got over to the bus station, I went through the bus station with some other officers and some superior officers, I believe Captain Wall and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.763" offset="1302444">And I went out and told that group, that is the Freedom Riders, that group of people in a voice loud enough to be heard who I was.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.851" offset="1326791">I identified myself and told them that due to circumstances that day that I, as Chief of Police, was arresting them and taking them into protective custody of the City of Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.405" offset="1372975">Then, he said Shuttlesworth came over.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.179" offset="1380080">Now, this is the only dispute in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.932" offset="1387081">It's not terribly material.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.552" offset="1393560">He said Shuttlesworth came over from a distance away and interjected himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.086" offset="1407666">There, Shuttlesworth maintains he was there all the time and indeed, a captain of the police and a police officer also testified that Shuttlesworth was with the group all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.667" offset="1454059">But the dispute is whether Shuttlesworth interjected himself or had been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.004" offset="1467434">Anyway, he said, "Shuttlesworth came over and I called him Fred, that -- called him by his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.334" offset="1484675">I called him Fred.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.038" offset="1487496">I said he was not concerned with what ws happening there and he walked around and got between me and some of those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.245" offset="1512364">And I asked him again to go and he said if those people have to be arrested, why, he wanted to be arrested also."</text>
            <text syncTime="358.106" offset="1535770">Now, the Chief said this on page 25 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.256" offset="1552384">This took a very few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.253" offset="1564400">There is a police officer who testified and took about a few seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.522" offset="1581432">That was the entire transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.086" offset="1587702">That was what supposed to have consisted of interfering with the police officer in the exercise of his lawful duty and then, later, this is supposed to have been an assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.041" offset="1627512">Chief testified Shuttlesworth was not loud, he was not profane, he was not violent, and I think one thing that is absolutely clear about this case is that there was no violence, no threat of violence, no aggressive conduct on the part of this petitioner with the group with which he was at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.382" offset="1688952">They submitted immediately to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.663" offset="1698043">They were arrested and they were taken away.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="406.821" offset="1730644">Well, the Alabama Court of -- the Alabama Supreme Court wouldn't consider the charge because they said it was in the -- the petition said it was on the wrong-sized paper and that's something I hope to discuss in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.633" offset="1773902">The Alabama Court of Appeals, the lang -- I think the language would have to be read because, to me, Mr. Justice Harlan, it's not entirely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.562" offset="1813608">In part, it seems to indicate that since the penalty for assault and for interfering with the police officer in the exercise of a lawful duty are the same, it really didn't matter if he was guilty of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.625" offset="1861883">In part, there seems to be intimation that this is an included offense in the doctrine of interfering with a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.260" offset="1904410">And this -- the opinion of the Court of Appeals is very brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.083" offset="1935653">Now, it's our -- our first argument that, heretofore, we have been unable to find in Alabama law any such doctrine as protective custody, that the police were not in the exercise of any lawful duty when they were taking someone into protective custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.989" offset="1999287">The Alabama Court of Appeals defines protective custody, and this is for the first time, as taking someone into custody when he voluntarily submits to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.848" offset="2042755">But if anything is clear, these Freedom Riders had not voluntarily submitted to be taken into protective custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.516" offset="2069400">They were arrested and so there was no voluntary taking into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.922" offset="2091029">And secondly, I think it's clear that Shuttlesworth did not interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.778" offset="2102523">He was speaking to the police officer, in the testimony of different witnesses, from a few seconds to a few minutes and he was merely very politely inquiring as to what was going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.836" offset="2226761">Well, Your Honor, that curiously was exactly the same thing that was the fact in Taylor against Louisiana which this Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.637" offset="2265945">The Freedom Riders were there and they said that, well, they had to be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.062" offset="2283604">They were willing to agree to be arrested when confronted with the fact that, apparently, there was no alternative to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.470" offset="2305233">And Shuttlesworth's position, I'd just like to briefly read from the Taylor case, the spokesman said, "We have no choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.044" offset="2363538">That bit of rhetoric under those circumstances doesn't constitute a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.670" offset="2382033">And I don't think that he could've been charged and convicted of a crime for having said in that situation, "I'm with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.424" offset="2889017">That, on the one hand, it appears to be that he was not harmed in any way because he also committed an assault and the penalty is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.195" offset="2920155">On page 60, they use assault as an offense included in 856, and that's at the second end of the second full paragraph, and so they say both.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.786" offset="2966549">But that's the argument in Cole against Arkansas that we made.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.171" offset="2984103">I think this case is clearly under Cole, but we would submit to this Court that this Court doesn't really even have to reach the Cole question because in Cole against Arkansas, this Court remanded it to the State Supreme Court for reconsideration as to what section the man was convicted under.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.181" offset="3044080">The Arkansas Supreme Court reconsidered it and reaffirmed and then this Court affirmed, but that's not the situation here because there's no evidence to convict under interfering in the exercise of a lawful duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.730" offset="3086294">There was no lawful duty and we submit there was no interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.061" offset="3099564">And there was no assault either in the old sense, as we read the Alabama cases, or in the new sense of rudeness and anger because the testimony of the State's own witnesses says that there was neither rudeness nor anger here.</text>

            <text syncTime="771.900" offset="3190993">Now, Alabama uses folio paper for records and it has a rule which requires that petition for writ of certiorari be filed on folio paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.421" offset="3233102">And this is a folio paper here and this paper is eight and a half by fourteen and -- I'm sorry, this paper is ten and a half by sixteen and a half and the ordinary legal cap that's used in most other courts and is also used for other purposes in Alabama is eight and a half by fourteen and a half.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.062" offset="3315649">I may say that petitions for rehearing under Alabama law, there's a case, Redwine versus State, in our brief, are filed in ordinary legal cap paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.597" offset="3353788">Petitions for rehearing are jurisdictional prerequisite to filing petitions for writ of certiorari in the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.380" offset="3388897">Petitions for rehearing are filed on legal -- legal cap and then that is stapled to this paper, as here in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.076" offset="3427662">The opinions of the Supreme Court of Alabama also are customarily written on legal cap and stapled to the record, but we don't deny that there is a requirement that petitions for writ of certiorari be placed on transcript paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.092" offset="3495790">Our position concerning this rule is, however, that the rule itself, while it is a rule tended to be obeyed, it has been adopted because there are racks of a certain size in the office of the clerk and the Alabama Court of Appeals said in the case, Ex Parte Nation, that we have cited in our brief that this sized paper fits those sized racks and also this sized paper is less prone to rot.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.701" offset="3614177">Despite the fact that nevertheless the smaller sized paper is stapled into this sized paper for several purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.925" offset="3787107">Rogers against Alabama was a case in which Alabama refused to consider a federal claim because the pleading was prolix.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.713" offset="3830262">The question was, should failure to obey the state rule -- can -- can failure to obey the state rule preclude this Court from considering the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.091" offset="3859728">This Court said, no, it could not consider the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.765" offset="3870386">Another case is Staub against Baxley, a much more recent case which the Supreme Court of Georgia said that when you attack an ordinance, you must point out the particular sections of the ordinance you are attacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.335" offset="3916675">You can't attack the constitutionality of the ordinances as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.848" offset="3930781">While that may be a perfectly valid rule, for purposes of state law, this Court said that the rule under the circumstances was an arid and formalistic ritual and failure to obey it could not preclude this Court from considering the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.092" offset="3987728">Another case, a very early case, Carter against Texas, is a case in which the petitioner had not submitted a witness list setting forth the names of the witnesses he would have called to support his constitutional claim of jury discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.236" offset="4060348">This Court said that, again, perfectly valid state rule but that does not preclude this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.203" offset="4080201">It is -- this Court decides what is the proper way to raise federal questions for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.558" offset="4105592">Moreover, this is a rule of the Alabama courts themselves, it was not imposed by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.675" offset="4130043">And the Alabama courts have waived rules like this and even this rule and comparable rules under various -- in various situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.175" offset="4164106">In Ex Parte Wood, a case cited on page 27 of our brief, that was a mandamus case, mandamus also must be filed in this large-sized paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.621" offset="4197857">And the Court went into a very extensive consideration of the merits and then it said, "another reason is that we -- we reject the claim because it's on the wrong-sized paper".</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.053" offset="4239548">Two cases cited in our brief, Houston against State and Ex Parte Nations are cases in which this Court did consider the claims before it on the wrong-sized paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.510" offset="4281448">The Nations case, a very recent decision of the Alabama Court of Appeals, has an intimation that it's based in forma pauperis type considerations that there was a prisoner who -- where there was no indication that he could have obtained the larger paper, but the fact that the Court adopted this exception shows that it is a rule which under circumstances which the Court considers proper, may dispense with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.835" offset="4382699">Their requirements under Alabama law that a litigant must bind his exceptions into the -- his assignments of error into the transcript at the time of submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.599" offset="4421778">And there's a case, Mitchell v. Helms, that we cite in which they permitted him to write his exceptions on the transcript afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.596" offset="4453752">Many, many cases have made -- have excused failure to follow the rules recording -- requiring the writing of briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.650" offset="4493981">There are certain rules of how briefs should be written and the Alabama courts have frequently excused violations of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.158" offset="4523969">So the Alabama court has excused violations of rules like this and has considered the merits in cases in which the plea has been submitted on the wrong-sized paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.579" offset="4573706">And we submit in this Court in Williams against Georgia held that where a court has discretion, as here, the fact that it did not exercise its discretion in favor of a petitioner does not preclude this Court from considering a valid constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.231" offset="4644342">Moreover, we cite at the conclusion of our brief a recent decision of this Court, Hammerstein against Superior Court, in which this Court was faced with a -- an issue arising from the denial of a writ of prohibition in the District Court of Appeals in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.426" offset="4717066">The State Supreme Court had refused to hear the case on adequate state ground and this Court held that it -- since it -- what it had before was the judgment of the intermediate appellate court it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.070" offset="4763669">It declined to exercise that jurisdiction on other grounds, but it held that it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.675" offset="4782059">So we submit that there is no evidence upon which any of these charges rest, either the charges which he originally was tried or those which were raised for the first time in the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.889" offset="4830960">Then, under the Doctrine of Cole against Arkansas, it was denial of due process to affirm on a ground which there was no notice in the court below and that the issues are properly before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.565" offset="5289671">On page 40 of the record, one of the police officers who testified for the States said this entire transaction took a couple of seconds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.554" offset="5337631">And on page 25, the Chief himself said it was a very few minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.756" offset="5370441">Now, I don't think it's an interference with the police for someone who is a member of a group to come over and in the -- a matter of seconds really or moment or two at the most, to make an inquiry as to what is occurring, especially one that is apparent, as it was here, that the police were acting entirely in an unlawful manner, certainly without lawful authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.800" offset="5454555">I -- I think that if something like this had gone on and it developed into a harangue or a wrangle, you would reach a point in which it would reach the -- perhaps the dignity of -- of an interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.005" offset="5499382">But I don't believe there's anything of the sort for that momentary encounter and inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.614" offset="5625814">Of course, the first issue before this Court is the question of the granting of certiorari and the failure to comply with judicial procedure in the State of Alabama in going from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.162" offset="5703973">That was complete -- they completely ignored that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.307" offset="5724557">Any attorney in Alabama can tell you that that's fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.320" offset="5748694">At any case, it's fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.640" offset="5761964">The decisions of the Supreme Court on numerous -- Alabama Supreme Court, that they must use this paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.691" offset="5802088">Now, it is not merely a ritual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.733" offset="5814314">There are reasons behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.353" offset="5824763">I am sure it has been enforced in effect in the Supreme Court of Alabama, the reasonable body.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.150" offset="5895920">The -- rather the appellant ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.220" offset="5908250">And in view of the other aspects of the case and in view of the fact that this Court has granted certiorari and in view of Hammerstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.197" offset="5968123">And we must remember that Hammerstein, even though this Court granted certiorari, they still came back and said the court is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.512" offset="5997380">There was procedural method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.524" offset="6005426">They could take Hammerstein with an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.215" offset="6016188">In a paternity suit, they failed to take the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.893" offset="6026951">They could have taken the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.584" offset="6033742">Hammerstein involved probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.915" offset="6043042">So this Court came back in Hammerstein and dismissed because certiorari was improvidently granted but need -- that not be in the -- that being the case nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.200" offset="6096123">I think this case has an element here that is of such paramount importance but I'm not going to argue that point further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.735" offset="10598275">They -- they were not -- were not arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.943" offset="10607156">Now, let me -- if the Court please, let me go through the evidence it shows there -- as I said, the Chief said he told them twice to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.528" offset="10657520">And Chief Moore says, "He was in my way and he was asking me what happened."</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.268" offset="10676433">And Captain Garrison says he stepped between the Chief and the group of Freedom Riders and I, myself, told him to move three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.274" offset="10708511">He was told to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.114" offset="10715826">Now, we submit that whether the Chief and the police were trying to maintain law and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.484" offset="10737351">Now, whether the police officers had a right -- I mean the Freedom Riders had a right to complain or not is not relevant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.118" offset="10771832">That police officers had a tense situation that they were trying to control and they were trying to eliminate, and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.817" offset="10806627">And we go further and we find, at Record 29, they couldn't get a driver to take the bus out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.836" offset="10842676">Did he refuse to leave?</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.010" offset="10847378">He did not by leaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.496" offset="10853334">When Reverend Shuttlesworth refused to -- to leave after he was told to leave and Captain Warren says their Chief asked him to get out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.358" offset="10896802">Captain Warren testified to what the Chief says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.162" offset="10907982">And we -- we don't -- we come on down to Captain Warren and we -- Captain Garrison and we find in one place of the record there where the defendant's own attorney says, "Was your action in the taking the Freedom Riders into protected custody made any harder?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.127" offset="10995858">Of course, we couldn't have answered such question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.664" offset="11005994">Clearly, it was a call for police -- a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.314" offset="11020622">But his own attorney asked him that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.864" offset="11026787">Our office -- our attorney in -- on the case did not object and he said, "Yes, it made it harder."</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.220" offset="11052283">We have a clear case of interfering and hindering the police in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.994" offset="11079346">Now, this -- the question of the maintenance of law and order in this nature is such that the police, in the issuance of reasonable directions and that has always been the law, the question to determine when direction should be issued and what direction as long as they were reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.829" offset="11162728">And these were reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.923" offset="11171088">The question of the validity of any protective arrest is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.101" offset="11195747">And we submit that the defendant, Reverend Shuttlesworth, could have cost the lives of police officers and people there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.767" offset="11258441">Now, that's not farfetched in May of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.147" offset="11275995">It was a situation that was occurring in this -- in the south that they did later on without publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.914" offset="11311000">Now, that -- that's your -- that's your danger in this case, is the publicity that was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.794" offset="11330539">We -- we don't know where it came from but the publicity that was given that they were coming in and the publicity has a tendency to create a tense situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.341" offset="11372753">And law and order is like, we submit, is like the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.770" offset="11390412">Except in this -- and it's -- and then when the police is trying to enforce law and order, that they have a right to give directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.882" offset="11426879">I can go down the street here in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.667" offset="11438059">I wouldn't think one minute of disobeying an order of a policeman not to go down that street because I got a legal right to go down there under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.619" offset="11473899">But that police officer said, "Go this way", for some reason that he may know and I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.379" offset="11492916">I've got no right to dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.823" offset="11502634">And that's exactly what -- what Reverend Shuttlesworth was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.798" offset="11518516">He was arguing, he was discussing, he was failing three times and he, himself, admits twice and the evidence shows three times that he was asked to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.799" offset="11554565">All he had to do was go to another place in the bus station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.607" offset="11577762">Now, the action of the police is shown by the success, the success it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.539" offset="11601481">It did not -- it did not result in a riot like it did in Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.571" offset="11621648">It did not result in harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.229" offset="11632306">It did not completely prohibit there -- their going to Montgomery and that they did go -- did go at a -- at a later time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2923.201" offset="11796146">The hindering of a -- the hindering of a police officer, interfering with a police officer, includes assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.270" offset="11824462">And of course, if I walk up to a police officer and hold off and hit him while he is trying to perform a duty, directing traffic even, I am interfering with him in the operation of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.307" offset="11872632">We have never argued there was an assault in this case, but we do argue that assault is within the -- this section of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.501" offset="11905337">And under Section 6 of our City Code, we have the right of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.741" offset="11922369">The charge was interfering with the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.350" offset="11932818">The -- and the Court of Appeals says included in that charge is assault and he was guilty of assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.267" offset="11956433">Now, I'm not arguing whether he was or wasn't because the judgment of the Court of Appeals is not necessarily based on the opinion but is based on the judgment which says, "It is, therefore, considered that the judgment of the Circuit Court be, in all things, affirmed."</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.035" offset="12015470">Now, we will -- we submit that he was hindering the police officer and we must as a -- and this is distinguished from the -- from the South Carolina case because, in that case, from Edwards versus South Carolina, in that case, it said there had been -- there was no evidence there's threat and violence if the police did not move.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.642" offset="12221942">And I would like to go to a statement that Mr. Justice Jackson made, and I am aware it's in a dissenting opinion but some mighty good law has been made in dissenting opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.434" offset="12261125">And, if I can find it, he made the -- he made a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.657" offset="12289964">He says, "Silence in the speaker by authorities as a measure of mob control is like dynamiting a house to stop the spread of conflagration, but this kind of disorder does not abridge the right to speak except in an emergency."</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.567" offset="12357674">That's Khans versus New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.882" offset="12526947">Now, that's what his actions constituted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.259" offset="13140407">I would just like to clear up two brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.951" offset="13155140">First of all, when these Freedom Riders with whom Shuttlesworth was associated with, were arrested, they were all -- they were placed in jail for 12 hours but this was not merely a question of taking them out of the presence of a mob that allegedly was about to attack them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.384" offset="13212923">They were actually placed in jail for a period of 12 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.029" offset="13223476">Secondly --</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3281.755" offset="13230373">Yes, and that's on page 54 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.158" offset="13243956">Secondly, Shuttlesworth -- if this was for their protection, the question then arises, why weren't they protecting Shuttlesworth?</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.751" offset="13270392">Shuttlesworth was a Freedom Rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.942" offset="13279169">He was part of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.844" offset="13282722">He had a ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.534" offset="13285543">He had a suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.360" offset="13288782">He was going with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.380" offset="13304874">He -- that incidentally, is brought out even more fully in a case not cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.315" offset="13340609">He was charged, at the same time, for another crime, conspiracy to cause a mob to gather and that was reversed in the Alabama Court of Appeals at 157 2d 763.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.349" offset="13392750">And that makes even more clear what also appears in this record, that this was one large group of which Shuttlesworth also was a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.629" offset="13421902">But they protected the group and they arrested Shuttlesworth for -- apparently just being a member of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.868" offset="13462862">As to the question of assault being an included offense, Cole against Arkansas and other cases are based on the principle that, if one is charged with a crime, he has an opportunity to defend against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.088" offset="13523675">He could've presented evidence to indicate there was no assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.727" offset="13538304">He could have argued to the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.398" offset="13544991">He could've briefed the fact that there was no assault and indeed, there was no assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.296" offset="13560560">And the opinion of the Court of Appeals is based upon a clear misapprehension of the record concerning rudeness and anger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.330" offset="13588668">And if there were some notice that this was to be a prosecution for assault, either as a separate offense or as an included offense, there could have been a defense against assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.931" offset="13627120">But the first notice anybody had of that was in the affirmance of the Alabama Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.119" offset="13647809">We submit, however, that the no evidence point is the dominant point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.842" offset="13662751">There is no point in sending the case back to the Alabama courts for a reconsideration of whether or not there was an assault or there was interference with the police officer in the exercise of his duty, simply because there is no evidence of either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.162" offset="13716041">In any way, it is defined, any way that these various crimes are defined, either as heretofore or as defined for the first time, as do some of them, in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
