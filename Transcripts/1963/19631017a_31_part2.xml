            <text syncTime="1900.166" offset="7704012">The Court said that there was nothing before the Court after it had imposed that 20 year sentence and at that time for giving that 10-day notice had elapsed and he couldn't appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.344" offset="7748733">And so he lost his right of appeal in that regard and so far as I am aware he has not carried it forward as we have to raise the propriety of the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.589" offset="7789693">But I would say that in that case it's on different basis Mr. Justice Harlan, because the Court did impose that definite term of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.197" offset="7824175">It left nothing further to be done except that he said I would like to have a report under 4208 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.181" offset="7848103">Now it wasn't b -- it was 4208 (c) which authorizes the Court to get this psychiatric study and advisory report from the Bureau of Prisons and then utilize it in acting say under 35 or what, one very important effect of this 4208 (b) is that it extends from 90 days from 60 to 90 days, the period of the Court's control over the sentence and then for an additional three months if the Court sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.591" offset="7957713">And this is designed to be a judicial tool to be used in favor of the defendant and for that reason I would say that it would be appropriate for him to make the election, will he accept the benefits here, or does he want to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.115" offset="8007868">Now many times a party will say I am innocent, but I can't take the time and I can't take the expense or I haven't got the facilities for appeal or maybe he doesn't even have the evidence to vindicate himself as a jury verdict that has established his guilt and he has to learn to live with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.317" offset="8088639">However, I think the election procedure is available if this Court prescribes it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.811" offset="10066631">We welcome the clarification offered by these new bills and hope they will be enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.196" offset="10088155">Our chief criticism is Your Honor, that in this case at least this petitioner's right to appeal was lost for not understanding that the Right to Appeal was affected by these by 4208 (b) without any mention of the Right of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.060" offset="10155656">If it had been said as was in the legislative history referred to in number 86 the very much earlier legislative history, they proposed to say that the final judgment would be such and such and the Court may act even though appeal is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.838" offset="10218768">In the Smith case which we have cited in our brief, this Court rules that the District Court had no authority to grant a new trial while an appeal was pending and they issued orders mandamus and probation to grant an interference with the appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.946" offset="10291179">In other words the District Court was forbidden to act while an appeal was pending and I think that's a proper administration of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.497" offset="10325347">When an appeal was taken it moves into the Court of Appeals, District Court loses its authority on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.451" offset="10345200">It couldn't possibly minimize the sentence lawfully while the case is on appeal and probably wouldn't itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.729" offset="10378324">And if they did so a fellow might say well I've been in the penitentiary six months and the Court has reduced my sentence to the time served I'll abandon my appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.357" offset="10416776">Now why should we congest the Appellate Courts with appeals that we know may never be taken and why should we even following that congest this Court with needless petitions for certiorari that may never be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.541" offset="10469543">In other words, let's wind up the litigation in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.419" offset="10481037">Mr. Justice Goldberg says we have an election that this Court can sort of prescribe by saying that it would be proper for the District Judge to impose a definite appealable sentence on request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.934" offset="10531088">Now actually all we say is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.041" offset="10551568">Counsel and defendants has no rights to complaint about administration of law except that the law should be clear enough so that a lawyer below would know when his ten days begins to run or when he should take his appeal.</text>
