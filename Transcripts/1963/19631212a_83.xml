            <text syncTime="20.835" offset="186702">I think that I can perhaps best help the Court at the outset if I review in a cursory way, the factual backdrop against which the legal issue in this case is framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.393" offset="248978">The petitioner was born 73 years ago in Cosenza, Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.713" offset="282206">He was brought to the United States by his parents in 1895 at the age of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.252" offset="316374">50 years ago, he married his present wife who is a native-born American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.428" offset="349080">In the year 1925, he became naturalized, and 36 years later, by order, a final order of denaturalization, he became stateless.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.753" offset="422431">Deportation proceedings were instituted against him almost forthwith --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="84.367" offset="440822">What was his status before (Inaudible) in Italy --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="86.453" stopTime="202.737">
            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="86.453" offset="449181">Because he had forsworn Your Honor, allegiance to Victoria Emmanuel and as far as Italy was concerned and he is concerned, it does not recognize him as an Italian citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.442" offset="509158">Deportation proceedings were instituted against him almost forthwith and after hearing an order was entered by the hearing examiner, an order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.397" offset="564955">This was affirmed by the Board of Immigration and Naturalization Appeals and a petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was dismissed in December of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.977" offset="615320">The case is here, of course on writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.784" offset="630471">Now the basis of deportation which was first ordered and subsequently sustained by the lower court is found in Section 241 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, where it is provided that an alien is deportable who was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.682" offset="742066">Fact of the matter is the as the record shows in the year 1954, the petitioner was convicted in a case in the southern district of New York of two counts of income tax evasion, for the years 1948 and 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.307" offset="800580">It was a dual conviction in one case because there were multiple counts in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.376" offset="836838">Now the theory of the government's case, in the income tax evasion case as shown in this record was the Net Worth Expenditure Theory and I underscore this at this point because it becomes germane to our position as it's developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.011" offset="907368">The legal issue in this case –</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="202.737" offset="914369">Why was it germane (Inaudible)</text>

          <turn speaker="edward_bennett_williams" startTime="207.067" stopTime="803.238">
            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="207.067" offset="931610">It becomes germane, if the Court please, because of prejudice that inured to the petitioner as the result of the government's instruction and the lower court's instruction of 241 (a) (4), which I shall show you in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.352" offset="1016769">Now the legal issue here I think is needle-sharp.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.872" offset="1034846">It is our contention that an alien under the statute is not deportable for a conviction or convictions during the time when he enjoyed the status of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.696" offset="1110183">It is our position that there must be chronological coincidence between alienage and conviction under the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.333" offset="1144665">The service controverts this, says this is insult, but in any event even if he be right in construing the statute, even if the statute lends itself to misconstruction, they say nonetheless by virtue of skill, another section of the same statute, namely 348, that in any event, a denaturalization decree is retroactive in effect to the date of naturalization and citizenship becomes void ab initio, and therefore, there was concurrence chronologically of the status of alienage and conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.847" offset="1310804">We can say this and argue to the Court as we show that no court finally passing on this question has ever held that the denaturalization is retroactive or retrospective in application for deportation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.250" offset="1388335">And we say further that if the government's construction of the statute is the correct, then there is a violation of the petitioner's rights constitutional under the Fifth Amendment requiring that he not be deprived of his liberty without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.607" offset="1489795">Now I shall like in normal sequence to discuss first of all, the language of the statute per se, the language of the statute with which we're concerned which is Section 241 (a) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="360.361" offset="1544861">Now that statute provides in 241 (a) for deportation for some 18 categories of aliens, they are listed seriatim in paragraphs 1 through 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.326" offset="1620720">In paragraph 4, the specific language is that an alien is deportable anytime after entry is convicted of two crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.988" offset="1679339">Now it's our contention that that language requires that the convictions take place during the status of alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.628" offset="1729912">The Congress used the present copulative and where that is used there must be a concurrence time wise between the subject and the predicate, and the Congress recognized this because in every instance that is pertinent here, in every other paragraph 1 through 18 where the Congress set out to make a category of aliens deportable, it used both the present and the perfect tense, saying an alien who is or at any time has been since entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.987" offset="1879333">For example, in paragraph six, the Congress says, an alien who is or at any time has been after entry, member of the following classes and then it lists a long category of subversive failures.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.211" offset="1948191">And then in paragraph seven, it says, an alien is deportable who is engaged or at any time after entry has engaged and then it lists various types of subversive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.262" offset="2004407">In Paragraph 11 it says, is or at any time after entry has been a narcotic addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.408" offset="2033037">In paragraph 12 it says, is or at any time after entry has been the manager of a place of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.016" offset="2063444">Paragraph 14 is, or shall have been convicted of possessing a sawed-off shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.073" offset="2083715">15 and 16 is or shall have been convicted of the Alien Registration Act and finally, in 18, has been convicted of that section of the statute which outlaws the importation of aliens illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.122" offset="2147871">Now if that were not conclusive as to the meaning of the Congress, I think Section 241 (b) closes the issue because 241 (b) is made pertinent only to paragraph 4 of 241 (a), which happens to be the very paragraph with which we're concerned in this case and 241 (b) which is an indispensable part of the statutory scheme provides that an alien who is convicted may ask the sentencing court to recommend against deportation, and if the sentencing court does recommend against deportation, he shall not be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.569" offset="2365628">This is the only, 241 (a) (4) is the only paragraph to which 241 (b) is relevant, showing that the Congress intended that the convicted person be de facto alien at the time of his conviction, otherwise of course, this relief would be meaningless to the convicted defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.483" offset="2477328">Now of course, at the time the petitioner was convicted in 1954 this relief was not available to him because at that time, he had the status, de facto of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.886" offset="2534902">Now fortunately we have had a court that has fairly passed upon this issue because it has been framed precisely heretofore for the Ninth Circuit in the case of Gubbels against Hoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.896" offset="2582967">Now in Gubbels against Hoy, if the Court please, there was an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.354" offset="2600835">Gubbels was a member of the armed forces. Gubbels was convicted of two felonies by a military tribunal, court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.635" offset="2649945">Thereafter deportation proceedings were instituted against him and he was ordered deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.665" offset="2674082">He sought the review.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.748" offset="2678366">The case went to the Ninth Circuit and he claimed that he was not deportable for convictions before a military tribunal because the relief proffered to convicted aliens by 241 (b) was not available to him because he couldn't get that kind of relief from an ad hoc tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.493" offset="2757360">The government at that time did not quarrel with Gubbels position that 241 (b) was an indispensable, integral part of the congressional scheme for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.157" offset="2808038">Rather it said, Gubbels should have asked, should have asked the military tribunal to grant him this relief and he failed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.368" offset="2844818">When the Ninth Circuit came to grips with this problem in 1958, reported in 261 Fed 2nd at 952, just to say, this language appears at Page 2, the 21 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.631" offset="2921932">It seems plain that the qualifying provisions of subsection b are in an important part of a legislative scheme expressed in subsection (a) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="715.360" offset="2964773">While that section makes the conviction they are referred to ground for deportation, it is qualified in an important manner by the provision of subsection (b) (2), that if the court sentencing the alien makes the recommendation mentioned, then the provisions of subsection (a) (4) do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.666" offset="3038020">This extends to the alien, an important right of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.009" offset="3051395">No doubt in most cases, counsel for a convicted alien would by motion, call this provision to the attention of the court where the judgment was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.058" offset="3087653">It also seems plain that if a military court is so constituted or its procedures are such as to make this privilege extended by subsection (b) (2) not readily available to a convicted alien, then it would be a fair conclusion that convictions in a military court were not contemplated by subsection (a) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="767.433" offset="3173125">The requisite changes being made of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.235" offset="3184306">The language could well say that if the provisions of subsection (b) (2) were not readily available to a convicted alien, by virtue of the fact that he was not a de facto alien at the time that he was convicted and could not avail himself of this procedure then of course, it must be contemplated that Congress did not intend 241 (a) (4) to apply to any other then de facto aliens convicted after entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.801" offset="3806542">The government, if the Court please, as I read its brief, does not argue that our construction is a possible and a reasonable construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.914" offset="3846980">I don't want to put words into the solicitor's brief that aren't there, but I think this a fair reading of what he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.087" offset="3879685">He says at Page 9, “We do not contend that the question can be answered merely by a parsing of the words of the statute or by bare assertions that one reading or another is self-evident and the statute permits no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.614" offset="3941857">The process of interpretation does not stop with the words of the statute read in isolation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="964.337" offset="3960769">What is wrong with petitioner's interpretation is not so much that the words cannot be made to perform the service the petitioner demands of.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.276" offset="3992430">Now this Court in the case of Fong Haw Tan against Phelan decided in 1948 had much the same kind of problem before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.484" offset="4041331">In that case, Fong Haw Tan had committed two murders. He was tried in the same case with two murders on two counts and he was convicted and he was given two terms of life imprisonment and then deportation proceedings were instituted against him on the ground that he was an alien who fell within Section 19 (a) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1970, the forerunner of the one with which we are concerned, which provided at that time that an alien who was imprisoned for more than a year more than -- who was sentenced to imprisonment for more than a year, more than once shall be deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.294" offset="4224502">Fong Haw Tan said, “I wasn't sentenced more than once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.699" offset="4234219">I was only sentenced once because I went before the court once and he told me I had to serve two life terms.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.893" offset="4258983">And the service said, “Ridiculous! Of course, he got two sentences for two murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.835" offset="4278732">He got two sentences of life imprisonment and therefore, you are deportable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.226" offset="4296286">The Court in resolving the statute in favor of the alien said this, “We give expression to that view by reading this provision of the statute to authorize deportation only where an alien having committed a crime involving moral turpitude and having been convicted and sentenced, once again, commits the crime of that nature and is convicted and sentenced for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.633" offset="4389909">We resolve the doubts in favor of that construction because deportation is a drastic measure and at times equivalent of banishment or exile, citing Delgadillo against Carmichael.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.904" offset="4434944">It is the forfeiture for misconduct of a residence in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.818" offset="4458663">Such a forfeiture is a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.567" offset="4469635">To construe this statutory provision less generously to the alien might find support in logic, but since the states are considerable for the individual, we will not assume that Congress meant to trench on his freedom beyond that which is required by the narrowest of several possible meanings of the words used.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.517" offset="4537448">Court said precisely the same thing in Delgadillo which is referred to there in Brown against Wixon and in Ng Fung Ho against White, Mr. Justice Brandeis speaking for the Court called deportation, “The loss of both property and life of all that makes life worth living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.843" offset="4622712">Against the danger of such deprivation, the Fifth Amendment affords in its guarantee of due process of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.537" offset="4653537">Now it's our contention, if the Court please that the construction which the service puts upon the statute vis-à-vis this petitioner would deprive him of his constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment that section which safeguards his right to liberty and says “You shall not be deprived of it without due process of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.055" offset="4743607">Certainly, it's of the very matrix of due process of law that one be apprised of the consequences, the penal consequences of his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.518" offset="4801494">This I think is an indispensable part of the basic proposition relating to due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.650" offset="4833991">Now the government, I contend doesn't say that our construction of the statute is not a reasonable one and since it doesn't say that ours is not a reasonable one then I think the statute must be held up against the principle, engaged against the principle, void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.641" offset="4925942">This court in Jordan against De George applied the void for vagueness principle to the deportation statute in 1951 and said that it was applicable to deportation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.435" offset="4997099">Again, last year in Rosenberg against Fleuti, once again, this court, in its grant of certiorari was going to test the statue there involved against the void for vagueness problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.841" offset="5070764">Ultimately, it decided the case on a different ground avoiding the constitutional question on well-established principles, but in this case, the construction that the service argues for would deprive the petitioner of very basic rights because he was prejudiced as a result of the ambiguity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.370" offset="5188838">Had the petitioner been an alien at the time he was convicted, had he known that he was an alien that the statue made him an alien then he had several courses open to him to avoid the horrible consequence of exile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.273" offset="5260413">Number 1, he could have offered to plead guilty to one count of an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.066" offset="5295626">We all know, I don't think it's inappropriate to say that this Court might judicially notice that cases across the length and breadth of this nation are settled in the federal courts everyday by pleas of guilty to one felony count with nolle prosequi of the other counts in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.969" offset="5391235">If he had known that he faced banishment or exile, he could have pled guilty to one count and avoided the consequences of a dual conviction, or if the government had been obdurate and said, “No, we insist upon multiple count pleas in your case”, then he had another course upon to him and here's where, Mr. Justice Goldberg, the question that you pose becomes germane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.285" offset="5512547">This was a net worth expenditure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.372" offset="5524877">In a net worth expenditure case, as the Court well know as the government doesn't attempt to show precisely how much income was made each year because it usually is unable to show that. Rather it shows that its expenditure has exceeded its reported income over period of years and it seeks conviction on that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.440" offset="5613171">The defendant, had he realized and recognized that banishment or exile faced him for duality of conviction, might well have waived his rights under the Fifth Amendment, taken a witness stand and conceded that all of the unreported income contended for by the government had been earned in one year and that the expenditures had been made in subsequent years and thereby obviated the possibility of a dual conviction and ensured his conviction for one count or if the Court please, he might, had he been an alien, availed himself of the provisions of 241 (b), when he was found guilty of two counts and asked the sentencing judge as an alien to eliminate the possibility of exile for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.521" offset="5853497">The judge, in the case, as the record shows, imposed concurrent sentences, and so far as imprisonment was concerned and it might well have been that he would have regarded exile or banishment as a cruel punishment and an unusual punishment in this particular case, but this opportunity was not available to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.734" offset="5938343">It was not available to the defendant in the tax case, not available to the petitioner and therefore, he was prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.304" offset="5964570">Prejudiced, I say, constitutionally because he had not been apprised to the fact by the language of the statute that this penal consequence flowed from his conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.689" offset="6042102">I think you'll find them, Mr. Justice Goldberg, in pages 32 and 33 where we discussed Jordan v. De George and some of the cases that I have just talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.314" offset="6084629">Now, the pertinent case law does not support the service's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.067" offset="6127679">They place great emphasis on the case of Eichenlaub against Shaughnessy and say that, that decision by this Court is authority for the construction which they put upon the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.965" offset="6199254">The facts in the Eichenlaub case were simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.013" offset="6207404">Eichenlaub was born in Germany in 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.274" offset="6220466">He came to the United States in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.421" offset="6233004">In 1936, he was naturalized and in 1937 he returned to Germany, to the fatherland and then made a re-entry the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.359" offset="6284831">In 1941 he was convicted of violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.450" offset="6313148">Thereafter, he was denaturalized and deportation proceedings were instituted against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.301" offset="6340524">It's very significant I suggest to the Court that the service did not attempt to use the general deportation statute to deport him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.149" offset="6383992">It never asserted that as a basis for deportation the statute with which we are concerned although that statute said then as it does now that an alien is deportable if he commits a crime within five years after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.336" offset="6440730">His crime was committed and was convicted for within four years after entry because he came in, in 1937, was convicted in 1941 nonetheless it didn't urge this as a basis for deportation because I suggested it recognized that the language of that statute was couched in the present tense and required concurrence of alienage de facto with conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.389" offset="6544906">Rather it went to a specific statute, a statute passed in 1920 with specific language, which was aimed at aliens, German aliens who had violated wartime security of statute during World War I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.058" offset="6619617">Now, what did that statute say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.825" offset="6634663">The statute in the Eichenlaub case said an alien is deportable, if after hearing he is found to be an undesirable citizen by the Secretary of Labor who was then empowered to make these decisions to which, aliens who have been or may hereafter be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.428" offset="6745109">And the Supreme Court speaking of that language said the statutory language which says that aliens who since August 1, 1914 and then it Italicizes have been or may hereafter be convicted, referred to the requirement of the deportations be applicable to all persons who had been convicted of certain enumerated offenses since about the beginning of World War I whether these convictions were had before or after May 10, 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.271" offset="6860466">These crimes listed were not crimes in which the conviction is dependant upon the citizenship or lack a citizenship of their perpetuators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.271" offset="6892440">The Court divided four to three in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.985" offset="6907277">Now, with the statute of course which used the perfect tense talking about aliens who have been, it didn't use the present tense as the statute with which we're concerned did, yet the Court was troubled to the extent of a division of four to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.096" offset="6967777">Now more recently we have a case fortunately which I suggest to the Court is on all force with the case at bar, the case of Mangaoang against Boyd, a case that came out of the Ninth Circuit in which certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.718" offset="7026291">In the Mangaoang case, Mangaoang was born in the Philippine Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.917" offset="7051055">He came to the United States in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.637" offset="7065893">In 1934, the Philippine Independence Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.059" offset="7083656">The Philippine Independence Act granted independence to the Islands in 1946, but made all Philippine nationals living in the United States aliens for the purposes of the immigration, naturalization, expulsion and exclusion laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.711" offset="7142170">In 1938-1939 Mangaoang was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.877" offset="7170905">Thereafter, deportation proceedings were instituted against him under the Internal Security Sct of 1950 on the ground that Mangaoang is an alien who was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.026" offset="7231509">Now the statutory language of the deportation section relevant there was as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.571" offset="7265677">“Aliens who, at any time, shall be or shall have been members of any of the following classes and it lists the classes seriatim (C), Aliens who are members of the Communist Party of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.374" offset="7324818">Now, in Mangaoang, the Court distinguishes this case from the Eichenlaub case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.790" offset="7370480">It says, we do not think that the Eichenlaub case controls here for the reason that the statutory language there construed read quite differently than does the present act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.381" offset="7424920">In that case, the class of persons was described as all aliens who since August 1, 1914 have been or may hereafter be convicted of any violation or conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.966" offset="7483225">We think the language here under consideration, namely aliens who are members of the Communist Party, was intended to refer to persons who are the same time both aliens and members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.356" offset="7532753">We think it was not sufficient to prove that the appellant was an alien at the time of his arrest and that he was a member of the communist party at some prior date on which he was not shown to have been an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.370" offset="7576848">So the Court in the Mangaoang case, number one, said that where the language is in presenting, there must be a chronological concurrence, so the alienage and the status which makes them deportable, says number two that ambiguities in language of deportation statutes must under well established principles be decided favorably to the alien and it says number three that it will not accept the relation back theory for purposes of deportation because there of course there was a contention that alienage is related back to 1934 by virtue of the statutory language which says that Philippine nationals living in the United States shall be regarded as aliens for purposes of the expulsion laws from the year 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.428" offset="7797112">Now, if the Court please, the Ninth Circuit immediately after the Mangaoang case had had still another case before it, Resurreccion-Talavera against Barber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.817" offset="7858657">In that case, there was an entry in 1934 by a Philippine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.922" offset="7887078">He was convicted in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.037" offset="7895542">He made a trip to Mexico in 1952 and when he came back, the service sought to deport him on the ground that he was excludable at the time of his entry because he was an alien who was convicted prior to entry of a crime involving moral turpitude, and this is what the Court said, talking again about the tense of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.128" offset="8015914">The fact that Talavera was a national of the United States, not an alien at the time of his conviction of the crime involving moral turpitude is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.694" offset="8046111">The case of Mangaoang v. Boyd relied upon by appellant is indistinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.232" offset="8068263">Mangaoang was ordered deported under the provisions of The Internal Security Act of 1950 which authorized deportation of aliens who are members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.153" offset="8111940">This Court held that the statute in that case required that the deportee be simultaneously an alien and a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.567" offset="8137644">The statute under which Talavera was ordered deportee does not include a requirement that the deportee be an alien at the time of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.965" offset="8175261">Now what does the government say to this, to the construction of the statute which we say is the reasonable and logical construction of the statute from the whole statutory scheme and from the very language of the statute itself which is couched in the present tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.858" offset="8242761">It says well, Well even if you are right, even if you are right the language of the statute can be construed this way you still lose because Section 340 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 says that if you're denaturalized, the denaturalization decree relates back to the date of naturalization and your citizenship is void ab initio and therefore there was says the service a chronological co-incidence or concurrence of alienage with conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.456" offset="8401168">To that, we say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.444" offset="8413184">No court finally passing on this question has ever related denaturalization back for purposes of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.790" offset="8458533">This Court was invited to do just that in the Eichenlaub case and refrained from doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.264" offset="8492387">In Mangaoang against Boyd, the Ninth Circuit expressly refused to relate back denaturalization for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.970" offset="8531257">Fortunately, there is a case again on all force with the case at bar, the case of Brancato against Lehmann, which was decided in the Sixth Circuit in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.570" offset="8581622">In that case, Brancato came to the United States in the year 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.097" offset="8623731">He was naturalized in 1929 and then he went back to Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.590" offset="8649749">He reentered in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.528" offset="8661452">He was convicted of perjury in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.768" offset="8682454">In 1937, he was denaturalized and thereafter deportation proceedings were instituted against him on the ground that he was an alien who was convicted of a crime within five years after entry, the service taking the 1930 entry as being the entry relevant to the deportation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.429" offset="8777122">Now the service argued that alienage related back so that when he was denaturalized in 1937, it related back in 1929 when he was naturalized, but he was never a citizen, that his citizenship was void ab initio, so he went back to the fatherland he was an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.563" offset="8873671">When he came back he was just another alien seeking entry and when he was convicted two years later he was an alien who had been convicted two years after his return to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.598" offset="8917765">What does the Court say to this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.803" offset="8934588">The government's contention would require that we give the statute a relation back construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.683" offset="8962069">We have no difficulty in giving a retroactive effect to the denaturalization order in view of the authority supporting such a ruling, but the government has cited no case from the Supreme Court or the United States Courts of Appeal which has gone the additional step and given such relation back constructions to the deportation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.350" offset="9048795">It was urged upon the Supreme Court in United States ex rel. Eichenlaub v. Shaughnessy where the Court found that a ruling on the question was unnecessary for disposition of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.884" offset="9102921">We think that the Court's later rulings, the supreme court's later ruling in Barber v. Gonsalves, 347 U.S 637, indicates disapproval of a relation back construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.867" offset="9158823">The ruling, ordering deportation in United States ex rel. Eichenlaub v. Shaughnessy, was based upon the statute of May 10, 1920 which was a special statute dealing with sabotage and espionage during the First World War and applicable to some 1650 aliens then in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.917" offset="9239071">We do not believe that the construction given to the different wording of that statute is applicable to the general deportation statute with which we're now concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.404" offset="9704991">Your Honor, my position as I can show you does not different really from the government's position with respect of the very questions which you're posing and I want to show you what their position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.701" offset="9762147">If you'll just turn to the Solicitor's brief at page 38, there the service speaking through the Solicitor General says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.150" offset="9827976">“We do not argue, we wish to emphasize, that an alien who naturalization has been revoked under 340 (a) is in exactly the same position for all purposes as one that would never been naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.212" offset="9888266">The relation back provision obviously cannot be so mechanically applied without regard to its purposes or the consequence is produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.660" offset="9922017">It will be plainly absurd, for example, to charge a person who traveled on an American passport while he held the Certificate of Naturalization with having re-entered the country without the proper documents to avoid an entry fees as an alien because his naturalization was later revoked, citing a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.071" offset="9995682">A closure question is whether a person who travels abroad and returns while holding a naturalization certificate, should, because of his later denaturalization begin to have made an entry at that time for purposes of establishing deportability on the basis of a conviction for a single crime committed within five years of entry on the basis of pre-entry conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.135" offset="10095888">Then just going down two sentences, we come to the heart of the matter, to the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.762" offset="10122428">That being so, there is plainly an element of unfairness, says the government, in holding that a person who traveled abroad in reliance upon an outstanding Naturalization Certificate and that thought could be without consequence, in fact, made a new entry which placed in greater jeopardy his right to remain in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.424" offset="10205080">Since an alien not holding a naturalization certificate might well have refrained from leaving the country rather than risk of consequences of a new entry, such an application to the relation-back principle would not merely prevent the alien from benefiting from his fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.687" offset="10270072">It would in his sense make him worse off than he would have been had he never be naturalized for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.541" offset="10301524">The decision came Brancato against Lehmann, called the attention of the Court, saw which petitioners still heavily relies on, holding that coming into the country by a naturalized citizen is not made an entry, while it's denaturalization seems to worth entirely reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.379" offset="10388877">So I say, if the Court please, just changing the language of the government's position to fit this chase, if we started here and we said at the bottom of Page 39 since a alien not holding a Naturalization Certificate might well have plead guilty to one count in a felony indictment charging him with multiple counts of income tax evasion, rather than risk the consequences of exile, such an application of the relation-back principle would not merely prevent the alien from benefiting from this fraud, it would in a sense make him worse off by reason of this fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.423" offset="10541014">Or since the petitioner might well have taken the witness stand and waved his Fifth Amendment Rights and conceded that unreported income was garnered in one year rather than risk exile or banishment, certainly he is worse off under the construction advanced by the Solicitor then he would be had he been an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.936" offset="10631084">And the same argument of course, Mr. Justice Goldberg can be made with respect to 241 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.704" offset="10654177">Since he has been an alien at least he would have been apprised to the fact that he could have asked the Court to recommend against deportation and undoubtedly he would have done that, he is worse off by the fact that he was naturalized and we don't say for one moment for this Court that he should profit or benefit by reason of his adjudicated fraud, we take the position of the Solicitor that he shouldn't be worse off to this extent, we say that a penalty of banishment or exile should not be imposed upon him and for this fraud without notice because it violates the basic tenets of the Fifth Amendment as the Deprivation of Liberty without due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.465" offset="11481213">Prior to 1952 it had been judicially enunciated several times that a Denaturalization Order procured by reason of fraud made citizenship void ab initio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.594" offset="11565746">In 1952, the Congress changed the language of the Denaturalization Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.360" offset="11596779">Prior to 1952 it had been that a person could be denaturalized if he illegally or fraudulently procured his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.570" offset="11625618">In 1952 under the new act, the language of the statute is that he is denaturalized, if he obtains his citizenship by willful misrepresentation, or by concealing a material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.371" offset="11668877">So in 1952 for the first time, the Congress says, now if he obtains his citizenship by willful misrepresentation, or concealment, it's retroactive in application, then it goes on to delineate very carefully what the effect at least as I read the statute of this retroactive application is, there had been a great bit of confusion as to what effect the void ab initio concept had on derivative citizenship?</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.901" offset="11798967">How it affected wives and children of those persons who were denaturalized?</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.703" offset="11822164">And in the 1952 Act, the Congress was very methodical, they cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.230" offset="11840240">It said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.422" offset="11845047">It said if the denaturalization order is based on fraud, derivative citizenship falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.182" offset="11880051">It says that if the if the denaturalization order is based upon the fact that the naturalized person became a member of the Communist Party or various subversive organizations within five years after naturalization and the proof is that he was at the time he was naturalized or alternatively if the naturalized person returned to the old country for permanent residence within five years after his naturalization showing that he had no real intent to stay here, then derivative citizenship falls for wives and children not living in the United States, but does not fall for wives and children then residing in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.324" offset="12344717">Well, that maybe a harsh application of the deportation statute, but the validity of that is not in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.089" offset="12371780">The only question as Justice Goldberg noted is whether the petitioner, for the statute should be less harshly applied to the petitioner because he not only committed two crimes but also committed a fraud to obtain a naturalization certificate which has been revoked for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.336" offset="12448684">There are two branches to our argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.276" offset="13092446">Now our argument on 241 (a) (4), the petitioner quite rightly says, there is not that his reading of the words as the matter of language is impossible and if that's the test, then we're out of court, but I think that is not the end inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.571" offset="13177605">Our argument is that our interpretation is necessary to make sense out of the statute in relationship to the other provisions and to avoid what we think are quite irrational capricious distinctions that Congress could not have intended and also the authority of the Eichenlaub case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.024" offset="13299440">Now, the first is that making his deportability turn up on or making deportability turn upon the prior status of the deportee at some prior time simply has no logical relevance to the purposes of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.685" offset="13374151">The purpose of deportation is to remove from the country those who because they are now aliens remain here at the will of Congress and who Congress and its wisdom concludes are no longer desirable people to have because of some revealed characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.943" offset="13455130">The relevance of the two-conviction standard is the congressional judgment that a man who has been twice convicted has demonstrated that he has a criminal propensity, his quality of criminality and because of that quality he is no longer desired as a resident in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.812" offset="13538617">That is the whole thrust of the deportation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.589" offset="13557739">Now, if that be so, it seems to us that the fact that at the time he was convicted, he may have had a purported citizenship status, has nothing to do with the purpose to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.880" offset="13618866">The conviction of the two crimes equally demonstrates his criminal propensity whether he held at that time a naturalization certificate or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="4347.719" offset="17494288">He was thereafter sought to be deported under the statute, it's set forth at Page 19 of our brief, which speaking as of the date of this enactment which is 1920 says provides for deportation of "All aliens who since August 1, 1914, have been or may hereafter be convicted" of the crimes listed one of which was the crime of which Eichenlaub was convicted that -- since Eichenlaub was convicted in 1941 long after the statute the relevant language of the statute is "All aliens who may hereafter be convicted of such a crime” and I think it's obvious that exactly the same argument could be made about the meaning of that language as it is made about the meaning of this language and in fact it was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="4412.273" offset="17752482">It said that all the statute required is that you be an alien at the time of the deportation proceedings and that you be a person who has been convicted of such a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="4437.283" offset="17852479">Its decision rests primarily on the lack of any reason why Congress would have made the prior status relevant, the anomaly or irrationality of -- if prior status were be relevant of looking to the time of conviction rather than a time of commission and finally the anomaly of allowing an alien who had fraudulently obtained citizenship and had it cancelled to plead his fraudulently acquired and since cancelled status as a defense to deportation and those reasons we say are equally applicable to this case and Eichenlaub fully controls this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4546.933" offset="18291127">Before I leave my first point, I like to acknowledge the Eichenlaub decision was decided by four to three Court and does not represent an absolute majority Court nevertheless we urge that it is entitled to be followed based on three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.098" offset="18359777">First, because it's right, secondly because it -- even though it's four-three decision, it is the decision of this Court and the reason why that need to be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.794" offset="18394572">And finally, because I think since it is more real here than usually is the case, Congress has relied upon in enacting the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.615" offset="18445876">It not only did reenact the very provision involved in Eichenlaub in Sub-section 17, but I think it is a fair, at least possibility, I would think, I would be quite confident, that had the Eichenlaub decision been decided the other way, and the Court had felt that the tense maybe implied that he had to be an alien at that time, that Congress would have revised the provisions using that kind of language to remove the possibility of that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.493" offset="18601357">The Eichenlaub decision, however, removed in a reason to rescan the provisions to take out any provisions that would pose that problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="4809.259" offset="19340413">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.222" offset="19352221">Section 340 (a) is the basic denaturalization provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.044" offset="19367581">It provides seniors to denaturalize persons who obtain their citizenship by willful misrepresentations and then add in a provision which is new to the 1952 Act that such revocation and setting aside of the order admitting him for citizenship shall be effective as off the original date of the order and certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.263" offset="19452426">Thus in this case denaturalization order shall be effective as of 1925 and we think giving that literal and natural meaning, it means that Costello must now be deemed to have been an alien through out the period of time that he held a naturalization certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.629" offset="19521912">Now I want to hasten to add that we don't argue that the relation back provision can be applied quite that simply or mechanically and if you do have to look to its purposes and to some extent can confine to an area which Congress seems to have intended it to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.988" offset="19595368">What I want to show is that in fact this is the central purpose of the provision was this application in this very context.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.103" offset="19651793">Now as I take a basic agreement between us and the petitioner but the relation back petition was at least in some sense a codification of existing law, it didn't spring new born.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.273" offset="19700485">But what that existing law consisted off is very important and we say consistent basically four court of appeals decisions plus a reservation from the question by this Court in Eichenlaub.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.090" offset="19759731">Now to be sure there were some earlier decisions of this Court not all involving really an application of relation back, language that suggests that one who acquires a grant by fraud takes nothing by his paper grant, that sort of general language you find might be the nullity but the first real application of the relation back doctrine came in 1932 in a decision by Third Circuit in Rosenberg versus United States, 60 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.298" offset="19884596">In that case the Court held or at least opined because in fact I don't quite see the relevance of that what it said to the issue within Court, but it at least said that a woman who had been married to a naturalized citizen whose citizenship was later revoke because of fraud was herself not a citizen and she would have been – had he been a citizen when she married him and in doing so, it simply said that since the citizenship was cancelled for fraud, he never was a citizen and therefore she could never been the wife of a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.129" offset="20059930">The next case at the appellate level was the decision by the Second Circuit in the Eichenlaub case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.957" offset="20091173">That's the same case I discussed which is reported at 167 F. 2d and in that case in response to the claim that Eichenlaub cannot be deported because he was not an alien at the time he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.080" offset="20147702">The Court of Appeals responded simply that the degree of naturalization relates back at least for that purpose and disposed of the case specifically on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.382" offset="20192946">By the year later in the Willumeit case, again in the Second Circuit, the Second Circuit reaffirmed that holding after full argument on very issue and beside of that case and the relation back that involved exactly the same issue as Eichenlaub deportation and time of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.665" offset="20265984">About 3 months after that the Second Circuit decided another case, the Battaglino case at 172F 2d, that was a derivative citizenship case and the court held that the son of a naturalized citizen, the son being born and brought and his father later been denaturalized for fraud in that case presumptive fraud, but the son was not a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.707" offset="20374235">For this simple reason that since the father's citizenship was revoked because of invalidity ab initio that father was not a citizen where their son was born and therefore he was not a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.187" offset="20428152">Now I want to emphasis that all of those cases the courts applied simply a monolithic concept of the retroactive effect of denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.876" offset="20470888">They reasoned simply that since the father's citizenship was revoked for initial defects, he never was a citizen and therefore was not a citizen either at the time that his son was born or at the time he was convicted or whatever was the relevant time and no one could justify slightest distinction and the application of that principle as between the two purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="5202.293" offset="20912567">Now the next step as I say was this Court's decision in Eichenlaub and Willumeit, they were combined and because this Court as I pointed out decided the case rather on the basis that the statute did not require alienage and did not rely on the relation-back theory as the Court of Appeals had.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.706" offset="20986232">It did however, at least stayed the relation-back issue and because what it said about that provided the final prelude to the legislation we set it forth in full in our brief at page 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.324" offset="21044642">What the Court, after stating the issue, says is that the government suggests that one route to a conclusion on this issue is to hold that the relators as a matter of law were “aliens” when so convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.047" offset="21091558">The basis it suggests for so holding is that the judicial annulment of the relators naturalizations on the ground of fraud in their procurement deprived them of their naturalizations ab initio, citing Rosenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.405" offset="21144952">They thus would be returned to their status as aliens as of the date of their respective naturalizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.616" offset="21169821">And accordingly, they would not be liable to deportation if you read the statute it was requiring aliens and then they say in our opinion it is not necessary, for the purposes of these cases, to give a retroactive effect to the denaturalization orders but rather we can decide it on the ground they did decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.538" offset="21241501">Now it seems to me clear that the effect about what the Court there said, was to leave the relation-back doctrine which after all was that well settled in any event, it's only been these four cases rather than really giving very extended treatment to it, was to leave that question entirely up in the air, nothing was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.593" offset="21341706">The Court preferred not to rule on that question and it provided I suggest more than ample occasion for Congress which was now already engaged in a complete restatement of the law of integration to settle the matter, once and for all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.932" offset="21415058">And I suggest that it is exactly what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.006" offset="21431359">Less than 20 months after the Eichenlaub decision, senator McCarran in introducing revived version of the bill that ultimately became the law, included for the first time the express provision that such revocation shall be effective as of the date of the original naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.512" offset="21513383">I might note that the language parallels the opinion in the sense the opinion refers to the argument as been that they would be returned to the status as aliens as of the date of their respective naturalizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.252" offset="21564374">And what I suggest is that the only explanation for the edition of that provision of the statute was to settle the question the court had not settled and to write it into the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="5747.805" offset="23094627">Now the further answer is that the original bill contained for the first time what is now in Section 348 (f) expressly proving affirmatively for the consequences of denaturalization upon derivative citizenship that was no longer left the relation back doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="6713.080" offset="26955734">Now if the Court please, Mr. Barnett with his customary forthrightness says to the Court, if the language of the statute is determined, what the statute means then, and if that's the sole criteria as to what the statute means, then the service is out of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.533" offset="27053537">And I say to the Court when we test the constitutionality of the statute against the void for vagueness principle, certainly it is the language of the statute with which the citizen or the alien is expected to be familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6753.681" offset="27118111">There is no fiction in the law which requires them or assumes that he is cognizant of all the legislative debate or the legislative history that went behind the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6763.665" offset="27158026">If you read the statute and it means from its language one thing to a reasonable man, he is entitled to rely upon that and if he relies upon it reasonably to avoid the penal consequences of the conduct that is (Inaudible), and we say in this case that the language certainly lends itself to the construction that we place upon it, the government doesn't countervail that, and the language, as we construe it, requires the concurrence of alienage with conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.260" offset="27292400">Now the government in the relying upon the Eichenlaub case is relying upon language very different as the circuit courts have already found.</text>
            <text syncTime="6812.561" offset="27353631">Different from the general deportation statute, because the special statute in the Eichenlaub case says that an alien is deportable if after hearing by the Secretary of Labor he is found to be undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.652" offset="27414026">And then an undesirable alien is one to wit who may have been convicted or hereafter may be convicted of these various statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6837.788" offset="27454568">When the Ninth Circuit considered the relevance of the Eichenlaub case to a case where the verb was couched in the present tense, it said we don't think the Eichenlaub case controls here for the reason that the statutory language there construed read quite differently than does the present act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6857.518" offset="27533458">It goes on to point out that the Mangaoang statute was in the present tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.833" offset="27550699">And again in the Brancato case, addressing myself to the question posed by Mr. Justice Stewart, you will recall that in that case, the language as in the case at bar was couched in present tense was an alien who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for more than one year within five years after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6885.069" offset="27643695">Not only did the court reject the relation-back theory, but the Court did not say that that language could possibly mean one who did not have the status of alien at the time that he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6899.463" offset="27701269">So on both force the Brancato case rejects the position that is advanced by the government in this case and when the Court said at the very end of the opinion the ruling ordering deportation in United States ex rel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6918.476" offset="27777233">Eichenlaub v. Shaughnessy was based upon the statute of May 10, 1920 which was a special statute dealing with sabotage and espionage during the first World War and applicable to some 650 aliens then in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="6933.442" offset="27837106">We do not believe that the construction given to the different wording of that statute is applicable to the general deportation statute which we are now considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="6943.064" offset="27875662">We could only admit in context that whereas we're dealing in the general deportation statute with language couched in the present tense which requires concurrence of alienage with conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.609" offset="27929788">In the Eichenlaub statute that we're dealing with language couched in the perfect tense which did not have this requirement and of course the relation back theory was rejected in the Brancato case.</text>

            <text syncTime="7429.291" offset="29820531">But certainly, the legislative history of 340 (a) not only does not support that construction, but it supports that construction as I read it and so it would been simpler I think to simply amend that the 241 (a) (4) and say here's what have been convicted of the crime at any time since entry and we wouldn't have the problem that we have here.</text>
