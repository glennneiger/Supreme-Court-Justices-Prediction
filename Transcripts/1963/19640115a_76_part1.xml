            <text syncTime="39.461" offset="261204">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.405" offset="276982">This matter is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Louisiana Supreme Court and there is basically involved the constitutionality of vagrancy statute of the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.834" offset="338735">I suspect that a succinct statement as to the surrounding facts will be helpful and appreciative of the full import of the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.201" offset="384188">The petitioner is an illiterate person and a poor person and in April 1961 was engaged as a farm laborer by a resident of Lafayette Parish, Louisiana and the employer in question happened to be the father of one of the arresting deputies who arrested the petitioner on the charge of -- in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.611" offset="505814">The agreement for or rather control in a working arrangement was that, the petitioner was to be paid $4 a day for his services and to be provided with his food and also lodging, the lodging consisting of a small building approximately 8 by 10 in which he was permitted to reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.632" offset="589928">The employer paid the petitioner for about a month and thereafter discontinued paying his wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.641" offset="613961">The petitioner continued to ask payment, but on each occasion he was told that he would be paid later.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.237" offset="640293">As a consequence of course the petitioner was, had no funds with which to leave and seek out other employment and he lived in virtual peonage for approximately eight moths.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.326" offset="684701">And then on one day approximately eight months after the initial engagement of his services the -- an argument arose between the employer and petitioner as to chores to be performed as a result of which the employer told him to leave his premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.869" offset="758888">He agreed to do this and he asked permission of the employer to leave his personal belongings in this little one room shack that he occupied, his small amount of clothing that he had and this permission was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.240" offset="808312">And he took leave to go to Nevada in search of employment where one of his sisters lived but because of his lack of skill he was unable to obtain employment in Nevada and returned Lafayette Parish and on his return however, he found other employment on a farm not to far removed from his previous employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.410" offset="893053">He returned to his shack to pick up his meager belongings and night time was had already come about and after he was in this little building for approximately ten minutes he heard a rap at the door and upon opening the door there were four deputies from the Sheriff's office there to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.104" offset="975809">They told him that there were there to arrest him on the instruction of his employer on a ground that he was trespassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.273" offset="1004440">He surrendered himself to them and they brought him to Parish jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.344" offset="11944730">And I think repeatedly this Court has held that such a statute when so vague is absolutely unconstitutional is depriving party of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.365" offset="11976808">Now also I might state that the classification itself, the theory behind the vagrancy statute Your Honor is that part is found in this type of situation or not doing anything intrinsically criminal but because of a status they occupy or the mode of existence which they pursue, they create a ferment that the breach undefined crimes and therefore they should be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.371" offset="12096867">Well we submit that the classification itself is unreasonable, it's discrimination that is not reasonably related to the purpose of the statue because there is evidence to demonstrate that the theory correct and therefore yes.</text>
