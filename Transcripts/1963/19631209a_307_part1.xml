            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="9.333" offset="141751">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.582" offset="154708">This is the appeal of the state election officials in the Delaware reapportionment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.921" offset="180099">I shall cover three topics, none of which simply repeat what was argued here last month in the other state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.554" offset="214580">First, I will discuss the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in this connection with particular reference to contemporaneous construction and enforcement of that Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.157" offset="269019">And second, I will discuss the contemporaneously articulated reasons underlying the 1963 amendment of the Delaware Constitution which the judgment below struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.672" offset="327116">And finally, I will discuss with Your Honors the haste with which the District Court proceeded allowing the State of Delaware 13 calendar days to amend its Constitution which worked out to two legislative days.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.254" offset="409454">Now, I'll start with the contemporaneous construction of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the Equal Protection Clause and I'll start there for the same reason that any construction of the Constitution itself, the instrument -- the basic instrument must start with the records of the Federal Convention and must face some heat to what the -- its framer said in the federals.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.642" offset="518959">Now the date and points for the Fourteenth Amendment on the Due Process Clause are these, first is June 1866, when the Fourteenth Amendment was submitted to the States for ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.855" offset="591788">Second is March 1867, when the first Reconstruction Act was passed and the third is June 1868, when seven former Confederate States were readmitted or at least their readmission was outright.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.000" offset="676425">These steps had been very recently reviewed by this Court in the case of United States against Florida in the 323rd United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.618" offset="718848">But I think it will be helpful if I recall just what it was -- just what the four steps were that the basic Reconstruction Act lay down.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.435" offset="770152">First, it was required that these 10 Southern States which had been subjected to military government would draft and ratify new State Constitutions in conformity with the Constitution of the United States in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.684" offset="847161">And the second step was that these Constitutions would be examined and approved by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.010" offset="876419">And the third step was that the several States seeking readmission to Congress would ratify the then pending Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.679" offset="919155">And the fourth requirement was that the Fourteenth Amendment become a part of the Constitution and then and only then would those States be readmitted to representation in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.375" offset="969937">One of the States that drafted a new State Constitution in conformity to this command was Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.978" offset="1000344">The boundary clause of which was before Your Honors in U.S. v. Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.305" offset="1021659">And under that Constitution, each county was entitled to at least one representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.831" offset="1051752">Now, the counties varied in size from some 12,000 people down to 83 and I am using the 1860 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.308" offset="1101594">Solicitor General says well, we'll use the 1870 because the Civil War brought grave relocations of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.124" offset="1132941">True enough, we recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.952" offset="1144226">But the Congress in 1868 couldn't pierce the veil of the future and look at the 1870 census reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.774" offset="1175468">So looking at the 18 census figures, the last available, with these population figures that I have indicated for the high and low of the Florida Counties and making three deductions, first for minority, second for femininity because women couldn't vote that time and third, for apathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.930" offset="1256135">We came up with the figure of 24 voters in the smallest county which meant a ratio in the lower House of 74-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.009" offset="1300438">Now, the omnibus bill which readmitted six States had originally not included Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.223" offset="1349339">Florida was added by the Senate and when the Senate amendments came back to the House for concurrence or rejection, the gentlemen in the House got up and it moved to strike out Florida from the Senate objection -- from the Senate amendment saying, "I might refer to the apportionment of representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.411" offset="1442022">By this Constitution, representatives in the legislature of Florida are apportioned in such a manner as to give to the sparsely populated portions of the State the control of the legislature."</text>
            <text syncTime="348.067" offset="1496670">Skipping a sentence, "By this Constitution, every county in that State is entitled to a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.427" offset="1526136">There are in that State counties that have not 30 registered voters, yet under this Constitution, every one of those counties is entitled to a representative in the legislature while the populous counties are entitled to only one representative each with an additional representative for every thousand inhabitants."</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="377.084" offset="1612758">That is in our replied brief, Your Honor, starting at page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.453" offset="1630208">It is from the congressional flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.189" offset="1653196">Well, the -- his motion to strike Florida out of the omnibus bill was rejected and among those voting to reject his amendment were Mr. Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, and certainly was no southern sympathizer or copperhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.514" offset="1726443">Mr. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania who was the father of the reconstruction and Mr. John A. Bingham of Ohio and Mr. Bingham was the man who was the draftsman of the second sentence of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, the one that contains the privileges, immunity -- and Immunities Clause, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.127" offset="1832918">Now, when he presented his amendment during the drafting of the Fourteenth Amendment, this is what he said, reading from page 25 of the reply brief, "The amendment does not give, as the second section shows, the power to Congress of regulating suffrage in the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.114" offset="1916824">The second section excludes the conclusion that by the First Section, suffrage is subjected to congressional law."</text>
            <text syncTime="461.920" offset="1952037">And this was concurred in, I have it on the next page, by Senator Howard of Michigan who was a radical Republican and the proponent of the Fourteenth Amendment but served the first section of the proposed amendment does not give the right of voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.188" offset="2013163">The right of suffrage is nearly the creature of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.480" offset="2026329">It does not regarded as one of those fundamental rights lying at the basis of all society and without which the people cannot exist except as slaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.943" offset="2072200">And that representative, if the Court please, that represented the general contemporaneous understanding because if it happened, why did they bother to pass the Fifteenth Amendment which dealt specifically with the right to vote?</text>
            <text syncTime="512.496" offset="2154329">And the part of which would've been plainly surplusage if the right to vote without discrimination had been extend by the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="529.866" offset="2223815">-- I cannot tell if there was provision for senatorial districts to be created by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.107" offset="2248788">It is not clear at all from the face of the Constitution whether it was to be apportioned according to population or according to political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.524" offset="2294450">Now, Congress in proposing the Fifteenth Amendment of the States obviously thought that something more was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.423" offset="2326110">And more than that, by the time that the Fifteenth Amendment had been proposed to the States, there were still four former Confederate States that were in fact in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.167" offset="2373026">And Congress passed two statutes laying down an additional condition for the readmission of those four States, namely, the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.482" offset="2442303">And that understanding was plain also to this Court and I refer to the case of Minor against Happersett in the 21st of Wallace and this is what you -- the Court said, "And still again," page 30 of the reply brief."</text>
            <text syncTime="602.984" offset="2516281">And still again, after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was deemed necessary to adopt the Fifteenth as follows," and then they quote, "The Fourteenth Amendment had already provided that no State should make or enforce any law which would've bri -- which should've bridged the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="623.524" offset="2598515">If suffrage was one of it, these privileges or immunities, why amend the Constitution to prevent its being denied on the count of race et cetera?</text>
            <text syncTime="633.596" offset="2638744">Nothing is more evident than that the greater must include the less.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.690" offset="2655148">And if all were already protected, why go through with the form of amending the Constitution to protect the party?</text>
            <text syncTime="645.125" offset="2684928">Now, Minor v. Happersett was the claim of a Missouri lady, Mrs. Minor, to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.246" offset="2713349">She said, she was a citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment and she had a right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.600" offset="2734770">And this Court unanimously held that she had no rights either under the Fourteenth Amendment or under the Guarantee Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.653" offset="2762982">And as a matter of fact, women had no federally protected right to vote until the Nineteenth Amendment and part of that would've been surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.574" offset="2798717">Now, if the Equal Protection Clause of its own force had wiped out all discriminations in respect to the exercise of voting rights, why was it necessary to bother with the Fifteenth Amendment and make those last Southern States ratify it and why was it necessary to follow with the Nineteenth Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="776.140" offset="3208944">I just -- I just was not able to run it down with the data at hand and certainly, it wasn't before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.954" offset="3244262">But going back to 1868 and I think the contemporaneous construction of the Fourteenth Amendment is particularly significant in view of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment which gave the Congress power to enforce the entire amendment by appropriate legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.517" offset="3322420">Now, Your Honors' opinion in United States v. Florida shows the care with which these Constitutions were examined and there are three other aspects of that careful meticulous microscopic, I think, one member of Congress said examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.108" offset="3400788">When Florida, as I've indicated state in the bill, when the senators from Florida presented themselves, there was violent debate not over the malapportionment in the legislature, the debate extended for 10 printed pages over whether Florida which had adopted the Fourteenth Amendment, quote adopted, in conformity with Section 5 of the Reconstruction Act but hadn't ratified it in conformity with using the language of the Omnibus Readmission Act of 1868 whether that was a compliance and they talked for 10 printed pages about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.698" offset="3575181">Then, the South Carolina Constitution came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.523" offset="3594512">The South Carolina Constitution of 1868 arranged its legislature basically on the federal pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.896" offset="3623978">The lower House according to population, the Senate according to counties, one senator for each county except Charleston County which would have two, applying the 1860 census figures conscious that those were not accurate because after all, Carolina -- South Carolina was that they are a seed of the theatre of war but they were the only ones available.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.297" offset="3713630">We find a discrepancy between senatorial districts of 5.2-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.147" offset="3737036">In the same way, Georgia had a Constitution that follow the fed -- that constructed its legislature on the federal pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.809" offset="3775592">Its House according to population, its Senate by groups of three contiguous counties each.And the discrepancy in respect of the senators to which came to 5.7-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.260" offset="3829405">Now, it is even more significant in the case of Georgia because it took three separate acts for Georgia to get back into the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.645" offset="3870992">First, they would -- it was permitted in under the blanket of the Omnibus Act of June 1868 and they went to work and they drafted their Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.186" offset="3909130">They set up a legislature then they admitted of a -- ejected a Negro member and they substitute it in his place an ex-confederate brigadier and that rouse the Congress and they put Georgia back under reconstruction the second act of December 1869 and added the condition of ratifying the Fifteenth Amendment also.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.540" offset="4018531">And then General Meade and his officers went through the Georgia Legislature with the fine-tooth comb and finally they got a legislature that satisfied at least those who examined it and then Congress passed a third act in July of 1870 to readmit Georgia finally and the Georgia senators finally took their seat in -- in the Senate in 1871 but nowhere during any of those discussions on the Omnibus Act of 1968 on the further Reconstruction Act of December 1869 or on the final Readmission Act of July 1870 was there a word said by any one anywhere?</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.276" offset="4181535">We cannot readmit the State of Georgia because its legislature's inconsist -- is formed in a manner inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause on the multiplication tables.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.708" offset="7267224">The House of Representatives has passed a bill to repeal the Mallory Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.165" offset="7285091">That bill is in the Senate and according to those who are pretty good prognosticators that hasn't got a chance of passing the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.572" offset="8910639">And as an essential similarity between the construction of the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause, both are generally -- generalized commands in -- with very vague contours, the problem is essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.442" offset="8974169">Now, under the Due Process Clause, we think there are four standards for well developed and familiar standards to be drawn from the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.131" offset="9012935">In the first two things and most important of these is that the Equal Protection Clause should -- cannot properly -- should not properly be used as a vehicle to erect personal preferences and sociology or economics or political theory into constitutional absolutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.779" offset="9087540">And the second principle is that we don't use the Equal Protection Clause to stop experimentation in the insulated chambers of the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.759" offset="9127455">And the third principle is that we don't use the Fourteenth Amendment to overturn long settled principles particularly fourth in the area of poli -- the exercise of political rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.659" offset="9183044">And it seems -- seems to me that this admonition is particularly significant here, where the holding of the court below would overturn the -- diametrically the conception of the Equal Protection Clause held by those who framed it nearly a century ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.887" offset="9267994">This Court has, as I've said, only very recently reviewed in Ferguson and Skrupa a very unfortunate period of its history when the Due Process Clause was used to write personal preferences sincerely held, sincerely held by dedicated judges writing those preferences into the Due Process Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.941" offset="10512154">And let me explain that because it's one of the factors that condition may work of the people who drew the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.097" offset="10544755">The Delaware Constitution provides that for the Constitution to be amended leaving out of account -- a con -- a constitutional convention, it is necessary for an amendment to be passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the General Assembly, then followed by a -- an intervening General Assembly and then be repassed by two-thirds vote of both houses of the next General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.243" offset="10657395">The Constitution also provides that this amendment must be published at least three months before the coming general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.665" offset="10699086">The -- because of that, while the bipartisan committee, which I will refer to in detail, was work, the election officials asked for a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.330" offset="10757705">The District Court gave them from July 25 to August 6 because there was an election coming up in -- in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.937" offset="10804099">Actually, they had only until the 30th of July because the constitutional requirement for publication in the newspapers of each county involves some counties or at least one that has only a weekly paper which went to press on the 31st of July, so that actually the legislature -- the -- the Court's opinion came down on the 25th of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.687" offset="10911096">The legislature was immediately convened in the Special Session on the 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.371" offset="10937846">The 29th was a Sunday and they had to be through by the 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.210" offset="10957281">Now, if the District Court has said, “Alright, we can't make it in a hurry now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.357" offset="10977865">Why not take the first leg of a constitutional amendment for the 1963, 1964 session and get the next one passed by 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.725" offset="11015272">That would've given ample time but the Court never allowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.856" offset="11031782">And -- and that was up the -- that was -- that single factor conditioned all of the defects which were recognized but in two -- in three weeks work by the committee in two days work by the legislature was not sufficient either to redistrict the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.619" offset="11114851">Either they come up with a formula for redistricting or even to consider the District Court's original suggestion of letting reapportionment in Delaware be regulated by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.198" offset="11177232">Well, the -- the idea may have merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.464" offset="11186218">It has certain demerits also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.574" offset="11194681">Demerit number one, it reencountered to 106 -- 186 years of Delaware tradition having it in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.576" offset="11226655">Demerit number two, it added an element of political instability because demerit number 3, it lasted in the power of a party temporarily in control of the -- of the legislature to divide up the State to its own advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.397" offset="11301992">Now, there is a lot to be said for the District Court's suggestion but I submit that two legislative days isn't sufficient to make at a -- a knowledgeable informed choice on such a fundamental and far reaching step.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.933" offset="11832174">First -- first, let me state what the apportionment was when the suit was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.875" offset="11851922">That was under the 1897 Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.279" offset="11869477">“Rural” New Castle, Kent and Sussex County each had five senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.847" offset="11887762">The City of Wilmington had two additional senators so that New Castle had seven, the other two had five.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.856" offset="11991834">Now, the suit was brought in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.401" offset="12013986">The Governor appointed the bipartisan committee to look into reapportionment and draft an amendment early in July.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.625" offset="12046900">The committee met throughout the month of July and here were the factors that condition their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.258" offset="12085457">First, as I've said, Delaware has three counties only, one of which has 69% of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.088" offset="12112729">Second, in Delaware unlike the other States, and I'll take that up in just a minute, in Delaware, the counties had made the State, the State didn't make the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.942" offset="12168213">Third was the time limit, the short time limit and fourth were the amending requirements of the Delaware Constitution to which I have already adverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.194" offset="12205202">Now, this -- this commission came up with a new pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.313" offset="12221607">First, they equalized the Senate seats so as to give each county seven, then they divided up the largest representative districts on a quotient with the result that New Castle County got 25 instead of 15 so there are now 45 representatives in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.776" offset="12295481">And third, there was provision made for future redivisions dividing up of the largest districts after each census.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.617" offset="12326828">At the same time as the committee was acutely aware, the retention of the existing districts made for the continuation of the disproportions -- population disproportions in the existing districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.678" offset="12391090">And that plan because largely -- well, partly because of those disproportions and partly because of the adoption of the federal pattern was held neither reasonable nor rational by the District Court and it is similarly denounced by our opponents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.939" offset="12452112">Our plaintiff say it's half hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.129" offset="12460889">They denied the existence of any pattern, it has no reasonable basis, it has no rhyme or reason, and the Solicitor General chimes in with a loud “me, too”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.940" offset="12504148">He says it's without rational foundation in policy, there's no explanation, represents a disingenuous efforts as no policy to support the capricious discriminations italicizing “no”, says there are gross inequalities and finally winds up by triumphant peroration that it's a crazy quilt having neither rhyme nor reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.910" offset="12595994">But none of the people, whose denunciations I have quoted, ever looked at the reasons given by the people who grew up the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.764" offset="12631416">Now, it's true, they extend to 240 printed pages in this record and they extend it to 375 typewritten pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.779" offset="12683557">They were somewhat summarized by the Chairman of the committee when he testified but there isn't a single reference to the proceedings of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.210" offset="12721277">The word for word contemporaneous discussions not rationalizations after the event, we have something that looks funny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.308" offset="12757640">Let's see if we can justify it somewhat.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.315" offset="12789614">Now, I don't need to recall to the Court's mind that some of the Court's decisions have not always met with complete acceptance in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.061" offset="12856592">I don't suppose they ever will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.297" offset="12865578">But recently, some members of the Court have said and there he justly you can disagree with us if you like but read the opinions first.</text>

            <text syncTime="3784.836" offset="15243766">They could go their own ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.688" offset="15251184">And certainly, I mean, that the bond linking them was far more tenuous and far less specific than the bond linking these States under the Articles of Confederation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.262" offset="15301444">Going back to the committee, they decided to keep the existing senatorial districts and then, in order to give the lower county, the downstate counties two additional, they device floterial districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.654" offset="15362988">That took care of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.079" offset="15368735">Now, the House was more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.313" offset="15377617">There was the same impossibility of redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.854" offset="15391828">There was the strong probability of tremendous population growth in the near future because between 1950 and 1960, Kent had nearly doubled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.788" offset="15435504">And there was the same difficulty of the imbalances which they recognized so their solution was to add one more representative in each of the representative districts that had over 15,000 in a major fraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.150" offset="15489003">And that, then they came up against their biggest problem, House subdivide and that took a considerable discussion and it -- it was finally settled at the suggestion of a -- a motion of the Wilmington member, namely, subdivide the existing districts on this basis and let Kent and County and Sussex keep their own and after each census, subdivide them again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.658" offset="15590985">In other words, if a district -- if one of the new districts had 15 -- had 22,000 people which wouldn't entitle it to two representatives, that wouldn't be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.530" offset="15662561">The existing constitutional 1897 districts would be redivided after each census.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.674" offset="15695057">That was the best they could come up with then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.147" offset="15704984">And then the remaining steps were very easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.642" offset="15715015">They provided for a redistricting commission to set up these new districts, they set up anti gerrymander criteria, they set time limits for redistricting, they made it subject to judicial review, they made it enforceable by mandamus and finally they unanimously approved the entire plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.887" offset="15791919">And all agreed that it was a step forward and all agreed it was imperfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.688" offset="15815116">Well, it was a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.447" offset="15822221">The Constitution of the United States in the well-worn phrase was a bundle of compromises and yet the District Court criticized the plan because it represented the compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.201" offset="15869241">Now, in the light of these criteria which we have summarized to point three of our reply brief beginning at page 42 of that document ease somewhat the task of going through these voluminous materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.357" offset="15929846">We don't think that the plan deserves the strictures either of the District Court or of our plan because after all, what is -- what do we mean by reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.082" offset="15972686">As a definition by Mr. Justice Brandeis, which I think as good as any, we call that action reasonable which an informed, intelligent, just-minded, civilized man could rationally think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.252" offset="16045411">I think that if any other eight persons trying to reapportion the State of Delaware in this short time period would've come up with a very similar plan and I don't think we can charge them with being irrational or unreasonable because in the time available, they didn't come up with a better plan or because in 1962, they didn't come up with the plan, the -- the equalization features that they came up with in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.349" offset="16193787">Now, I come to the matter of the haste.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.793" offset="16207579">This, after all, represents a stately -- what is involved here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.111" offset="16228791">The principal litigant will not -- the docket litigant is the state of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.735" offset="16255331">And Your Honors indicated in the long and bitter and hard-fought Virginia versus West Virginia suit, how litigation involving a state of the union should be carried on slowly with all deliberate speed that's the source of this oft recently repeated expression with all deliberate speed as Virginia versus West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.259" offset="16357418">And we will wait for the next session of -- of the legislature and we will wait even when there is only sought a money judgment, even when the liability of the defendant is clear, even when we know down deep that the defendant is dragging its feet, its feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.439" offset="16434113">Even then we go slowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.426" offset="16442055">Now, here, here where we had a matter affecting the very structure of the State's Government where we had a situation where the guidelines have not yet been determined, where this Court has not spoken on the guidelines that governed legislative apportionment within a state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.711" offset="16535259">We have first, what Mr. Justice Clark called “blackjacking” because that's what it amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.091" offset="16560755">And we have not the standard of Virginia versus West Virginia but rather the circus barkers' “Hurry, hurry, hurry!”</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.787" offset="16607566">As I've indicated, I got two calendar days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.560" offset="16630659">And then the -- the Court on two occasions said, "We must proceed promptly."</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.814" offset="16655632">On -- throughout the trial and in the later opinion that talked about the -- people of Delaware being caught in the box of time, they were constricted by a box of time but it was that box was constructed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.496" offset="16726371">And then in its final opinion, the Court gave the legislature until the 1st of October to come up with a statute that would follow its guidelines and after the appeal was noted, they refused to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.403" offset="16802022">They required -- the Court required the Delaware General Assembly to come up with answers on the 1st of October, answers that haven't been found here yet two months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.082" offset="16844758">Take the question of the federal analogy and principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.768" offset="16859491">The -- the House chosen -- one house chosen without regard to population used in precise language of the reservation in Gray v. Sanders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.382" offset="16889898">The District Court rejected that in toto.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.221" offset="16913304">The -- there were some suggestions that there -- they said there can be no wide deviation from the principle of population representation in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.633" offset="16962936">Now, in the -- in the bipartisan committee's second report, they endeavored to correct these disproportions to which Mr. -- Justice Goldberg adverted by equalizing the districts within each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.333" offset="17025735">And such a -- a bill for that purpose actually passed the Senate on the day that the stay pending appeal was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.534" offset="17058544">And there were some suggestions in -- in the opinions that what was bad was the lack of equalization of the -- of the districts within each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.856" offset="17103788">And now, for the first time in the -- in the brief amicus, we're told that their redistricting within counties would be wrong because that wouldn't be the federal analogy, that to follow the federal analogy, they all have to be elected at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.417" offset="17162094">Well, the bipartisan committee was strongly opposed to elections at large within counties or anywhere else because it defeats minority representation where your parties are equally divided and you have districts, the minority party can get some representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.209" offset="17237222">But if all the seven senators regarded the elected at large, then one party is going to get all of them even though it only controls 51% of the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.230" offset="17281317">These are -- these are unsolved questions on the federal pattern or principle or model.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.190" offset="17321127">As I say, these are unsolved questions but the -- the Delaware General Assembly was directed to come up with answers to them two months ago.</text>
