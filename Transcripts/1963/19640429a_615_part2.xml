            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">-- Crooker versus California five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.841" offset="159723">In the case of Crooker versus California, some of the problems were similar and some were dissimilar.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.218" offset="193264">In that case, the petitioner, a college graduate who had one year of law school, was picked up by the police and at the beginning of his interrogation requested that he be allowed to call an attorney for the purpose of arranging to have that attorney represent him if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.020" offset="284484">The police officers of California refused this request and thereafter -- after a period of questioning which lasted some 15 hours, the petitioner gave a statement which was then introduced in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.925" offset="360135">This Court held that the admission of that statement into evidence did not violate that petitioner's right to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.893" offset="399945">In so doing, this Court laid down the standard that it's definitely agreed that the refusal of the right to consult with counsel is one of the factors to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.723" offset="455325">But, in the Crooker case, this Court found that because of the petitioner's experience and education, because of his obvious knowledge of his rights, he had told the people that, “Well, the lie detector test you plan to give me won't be admissible unless I stipulate to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="108.368" offset="537872">This Court held that the presumption of voluntariness was overcome by the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.138" offset="576951">Thus, this Court, in that case, held that the totality of circumstances must be looked at and under the totality in the Crooker case, they found that there was no prejudice, that the statement did not flow from the refusal of the right to consult with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.349" offset="653751">There was a vigorous dissent, to which I have averted in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.359" offset="681859">It is our contention today that either of two propositions should be announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.571" offset="710698">One, that under the standard set forth in the Crooker case, as applied to the factual complex of this case that the requirements of Crooker have been complied with and that the statement under the totality of circumstances has been shown to be the result of -- as Justice Frankfurter said in Rogers versus Richmond, constitutionally impermissible methods or as stated in the Haynes case, whether this was the -- not voluntary whether it was the result of the interrogation.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="188.537" offset="858551">Can you distinguish this case in Cicenia against Lagay?</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry L. Kroll</label>
            <text syncTime="193.930" offset="880076">The Cicenia case is a harder case to distinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.639" offset="894913">The Cicenia case, it would appear that the sole aspect that was there present was that the young man had been told by his attorney to turn himself in and then he had asked to be allowed to consult with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.426" offset="962100">And the attorney had requested also, but it appeared that there was no claim of overreaching during the period of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.246" offset="1005359">There was no claim made that he would not have confessed but for the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.483" offset="1030332">There was no showing how this refusal to allow him to consult worked to his disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.152" offset="1056977">In our case, we have a young man who was denied the right to consult with his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.050" offset="1084562">This is common.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.146" offset="1093026">We have a young man who was failed to be advised of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.394" offset="1117999">The state's attorney, who ultimately took the question-and-answer court reporter statement which was a practice that was questioned in the Spano case, the state's attorney admitted that he didn't advise the man of his right to have counsel or of his rights not to give a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.474" offset="1186335">And although the -- the petitioner was informed by his attorney, advised, “don't say anything,” he -- there is no showing in the record that he was advised that he had a right not to say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.364" offset="1237849">And, indeed, he was lead to be -- to understand by the denial of the police of his attorney's request that he really didn't have this right because here was the attorney, to his own sight, attempting to see him and he hears the police tell the attorney, “You can't see the man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="306.497" offset="1330427">So, what we have here is a man who wasn't told of his rights and if he would -- had been told of his rights by the attorney, which is a grave question, he was shown by the police that they weren't going to accommodate his rights, that they were going to refuse him.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.858" offset="1411824">We held the fact that he was -- seeing by writ -- by successive police officers, starting from three police who picked him up and told him, “You might as well confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.279" offset="1465532">We've got the goods on you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="341.923" offset="1472115">He was seen by an elderly police officer when he arrived at the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.669" offset="1491028">He was seen by three or four different police officers, among whom was this Officer Montejano.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.809" offset="1519658">He was confronted with a person who accused him of having committed the offense and even the state admits or their theory is that Danny never committed the actual offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.928" offset="1564066">That Danny was a mere accessory before the fact and that he had counseled the commission of this murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.723" offset="1607325">But they told him, “Well, we've got a man here who says you did it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="381.326" offset="1629686">This is similar to the Bram situation where he was placed in a situation of almost being forced by the nature of the accusation against him to either -- to make some sort of statement and almost lead to believe that, “You're not going to see your attorney until you do cooperate,” which is --</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.339" offset="6569754">Our position is that the constitutional right to counsel should be recognized in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.879" offset="6599952">When a suspect in police custody makes a specific request for an opportunity to talk to a lawyer, when he asks to talk to retained counsel where the police deny the request and proceed to interrogate him, as they did here, in a manner which was clearly seeking a confession, where the interrogation is secret, that is, no one is present who is either neutral or loyal to the interests of the prisoner, and where no satisfactory record is made of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.661" offset="6735057">We say that under this combination of circumstances, all of which were found in this record, that there should be a constitutionally protected right to counsel under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.046" offset="7076530">I would not stop by remarking on the fact that the question of what, if any, waiver rule would apply in these cases is not raised in this case because here we have a specific request for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.698" offset="7123237">I will go beyond saying that the shaping of any such waiver rule is for future cases which raise that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.024" offset="7152494">I'm not prepared to delineate all of the contours which such a waiver rule may take if and when it is developed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.716" offset="7191259">I would, however, add a few observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.117" offset="7200872">First, I think that Mr. Justice Douglas' dissenting opinion in Ashdown against Utah was clearly correct in indicating that a person in police custody should always have the right, certainly, to waive any right to counsel that he may have under the constitution and elect to talk to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.077" offset="7264716">It certainly seems clear to me that there would always be some waiver rule that there would not be an absolute requirement that counsel would have to be provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.376" offset="7317901">The British practice that the police had stopped a person on the street engaged in conversation, who called at the door and engaged in conversation, that this right to advise them of their constitutional rights or their right to a lawyer arises only at the time -- point of time when the police decide to hold the man, to arrest the him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.716" offset="7391253">I -- I don't think we have to go that far in this case, Mr. Justice Douglas, because I think, in this case and this isn't -- these are circumstances of course not peculiar to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.117" offset="7424899">We have not only the arrest of the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.537" offset="7434512">We have the fact that the suspect is obviously in jeopardy because when the police arrested him, they had an accusation that he was the assassin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.381" offset="7461888">We've had coupled with that the circumstances that, after the police denied his specific request to retain counsel, they proceeded to interrogate him secretly and without making a record of the interrogation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.461" offset="7506192">Now, the English practice to which Your Honor refers has recently been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.053" offset="7520611">The March issue of the Criminal Law Review contains a significantly revised statement of the well-known judges' rules on interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.775" offset="7555511">It's not my purpose here to dwell on the particular changes which are made under the new circular of the Home Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.109" offset="7580797">There are however, significant changes and I think the Court will be interested in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.272" offset="7597516">To return to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, which I have not completed answering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.361" offset="7613816">I must say in candor that I do not find the prospect you described, a horrible prospect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.054" offset="7632624">It seems to me a just a and fair rule ultimately to say that the constitutional requirement of fairness is itself a requirement that an ignorant person in the custody of the police, who is in jeopardy in a common sense meaning of that term, should be advised of his rights if he doesn't know them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.322" offset="7709633">And therefore, I -- I agree with you, Mr. Justice Harlan, that, ultimately, if this Court takes the first step down this road of developing a rule of constitutional fairness protecting the right to counsel of a suspect in these circumstances there are certainly further steps that are going to have to be taken someday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.110" offset="7780791">There may also be turns on the road and there may be twists back.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.817" offset="7883713">At the same time, if I may be permitted, the Court has the opportunity to develop its rules one step at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.167" offset="7913075">And where the rule is as potentially important as this one is, that certainly, seems to me, wise procedure, this is one of the reasons why we suggest here that the rule may be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.139" offset="7956961">Now, Mr. Justice Harlan asked, can this case be distinguished from Cicenia against Lagay?</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.635" offset="7990920">However, I believe that, in terms of the legal arguments and the issues and the focus presented that it can be because it appears from the reported opinion in Cicenia that the case was argued as though the only choice were between an absolute right to counsel on request of a suspect in police custody and no such right at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.119" offset="8764876">As I mentioned a moment ago, when the police obtained DiGerlando's accusation that Escobedo was the assassin, arrested Escobedo and confronted him with the accusation, and it's worth noting here that on this record, Escobedo testified that in the detective car, when he was being taken into the police station on the night of the 30th, he was told two things one, that the police had a person who had accused him of being the assassin and, secondly, “You might as well admit the crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.502" offset="8882427">In his words, “We had you sowed up pretty tight.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.305" offset="8893607">The first aspect of that statement testified to by Escobedo is admitted to by the police officer, Sullivan, that he told Escobedo in the car in the way in that the police had someone who would finger him as the assassin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.266" offset="8941464">The second aspect is nowhere contradicted and therefore, it seems to me it's an undisputed aspect of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.327" offset="8965705">This, it seems to me, is significant because of the fact that the police, not only confronted him with the accusation but made it clear to him that in their subsequent interrogation what they were looking for was a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.004" offset="9008441">It seems to me, there could be no reading of this record that the police were engaged in a casual or a neutral inquiry endeavoring to under -- discover the circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.854" offset="9055775">Now, it may be asked, well, the police had DiGerlando's accusation, wasn't it a reasonable thing for them to do to confront Escobedo and find out whether he admitted it, if he didn't, who was telling the truth?</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.166" offset="9105095">This, it seems to me, is a plausible argument but it rests upon a fallacious principle and that is the police should be the triers of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.241" offset="9137382">Because it seems to me that if that is accepted a proper delimitation of proper policed work in these circumstances where the police clearly have sufficient evidence to arrest and charge formally with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.208" offset="9189209">That then, what we have said is that the courts are unnecessary in a very meaningful sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.264" offset="9209480">Now, when Escobedo was arrested under these circumstances by the police he was in every sense of the word in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.681" offset="9235080">He needed a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.960" offset="9248246">And this was a critical stage in the proceeding which culminated in his conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2380.818" offset="9627648">Let me come immediately to the question to which your question refers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.237" offset="9645307">Was Escobedo prejudiced by the denial of his request to talk to his lawyer in the police station on the night of the 30th?</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.565" offset="9674668">Or, putting it in a slightly different way, did he, as the state contends here, have the effective assistance of counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.166" offset="9705075">Now, the state bases that argument upon two circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.040" offset="9716569">One, the one to which Your Honor refers, and that is the fact that admittedly during the interval between his first arrest on the 20th and his second arrest on the 30th, he had spoken to his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.246" offset="9761395">There's nothing in the record about the content of that consultation except for Escobedo's statement on page 20 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.595" offset="9790757">That a few days before he was arrested the second time, he talked to his lawyer and his lawyer told him, if he was arrested again, not to answer -- not to talk to the police without first, having the advice of his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.404" offset="9842061">The second fact on which the state relies in arguing that Escobedo had the effective assistance of counsel is the fact that when Escobedo saw his lawyer being barred through the open doorway, Wolfson, the lawyer, made a gesture to Escobedo which Escobedo testified, oddly enough, on redirect examination by his own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.375" offset="9925862">He took to mean he should not talk to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.102" offset="9944775">Those are the two facts that the state relies on to argue that he had the effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.079" offset="9964732">Now, as to the first, I think the testimony of Wolfson, the state says Wolfson talked to them every day, I think I will not take the time to read the testimony but I think, if the Court will look at Mr. Wolfson's testimony, and I believe it appears on page 10 of the record, it's in the hearing on the motion to suppress, it will be apparent that when Wolfson said he talked to his clients every day that he was making a lawyer's offhand answer to a question which by implication raised perhaps a question about whether he discharged his responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.784" offset="10083537">Escobedo's testimony on page 20 is much more specific, that they talked a few days before and Wolfson told him not talk without a lawyer's advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.111" offset="10112794">That only puts that into perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.581" offset="10118750">I think the daily consultation theme in the state's brief has to be cut down to size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.575" offset="10138708">But coming to the more important second point, when Wolfson made a sign or shook his head to Escobedo through the open doorway which Escobedo took to mean “don't talk, don't say anything to the police.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.342" offset="10181757">Was that the effective assistance of counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.237" offset="10193356">It seems to me that it would be a joke to say that that is the effective assistance of counsel because if that is, then the constitutional principle and the constitutional right can be satisfied by a gesture, by a shake of the head or by a finger to the lips, and it seems to me that the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments mean more than that in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.259" offset="10277470">We suggest that this was a critical stage for Escobedo's proceeding in every sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.867" offset="10303906">That within the logic of this Court's decisions in Hamilton against Alabama and White against Maryland, he was entitled to a constitutional right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.400" offset="10509960">Now, as to the question of whether or not Escobedo was prejudiced, I've spoken of the one aspect of that and that is whether or not he had, as the state claims, the effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.644" offset="10558966">There's one aspect -- one other aspect which should be referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.381" offset="10573908">He was of course, perhaps prejudiced because he confessed and maybe he wouldn't if he talked to his lawyer first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.766" offset="10595432">He was prejudiced, I think, in a more meaningful way because of the fact that the secrecy and the absence of a record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.920" offset="10636079">The secrecy and the absence of the record are conditions created by the affirmative act of the state which is an entire control of this proceeding and they have the effect of depriving him of a fair trial on the question of the admissibility of his confession because it means that the only witnesses are the defendant and the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.791" offset="10711521">The state knows that there are going to be disputes about the conduct of such an interrogation and yet, it sets the stage in such a way as to make objective evidence of what actually happened unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.203" offset="10761258">It seems to me that this type of unfairness rises to a constitutional level of unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.702" offset="10783201">And that's why I stress, as one of the circumstances under which the constitutional right should be recognized, the conducting of a secret and unrecorded interrogation by the police after it is apparent that they are looking for a confession and that they have sufficient evidence to justify an arrest and a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.446" offset="10854149">Now, the state says that a critical stage, within the logic, not the factual holding on the facts of Hamilton and White, that a critical stage in a criminal proceeding can come only after the judicial process has been invoked, that is after there is some kind of formal charge, if only, by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.162" offset="10921023">We say this is altogether unrealistic because of the fact -- if only because of the fact that the timing of such action is entirely under the control of the police and the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.564" offset="10970655">And under those circumstances it seems to me that whether we have an indictment as in Spano should not make a critical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.273" offset="11001480">It seems to me that the way to evaluate the -- that the critical dividing line is in terms of whether or not the defendant is in jeopardy in a practical and common sense way and here it appears that he was once the police arrested him and undertook the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.086" offset="11072742">I would like to stress that there are a number of ways in which this case does not necessarily raise the broad issues to which Mr. Justice Harlan's first question referred and which the state's brief stresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.031" offset="11116523">We have here a specific request for retaining counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.438" offset="11134182">We have the conduct of a secret and unrecorded interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.612" offset="11150796">It is not necessary therefore in this case to explore the ultimate reaches of what constitutional rule of waiver may ultimately be developed for cases in which there is either no request for counsel or in which the defendant is indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.146" offset="11221013">I would like to speak very briefly of the matter of the practical consequences for law enforcement to with which the state's brief stresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.835" offset="11251733">The state says that a ruling here that Escobedo had a constitutional right to talk to his lawyer would mean an end to police questioning, an end to confessions, and would cripple law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.747" offset="11299380">These arguments of course are traditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.294" offset="11309620">One recent example is referred to in the Court's opinion in Mapp against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.812" offset="11327592">Another example, of course, is some of the reaction to the Court's decision in Mallory against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.614" offset="11350894">In 1957, Assistant Attorney General Olney told the Committee of the House that “the police could not observe Mallory or else they would have to close up shop.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.731" offset="11387361">Those were his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.563" offset="11394675">The local United States Attorney, Mr. Gash, told the same committee in 1957 that the Mallory decision created an emergency situation which required immediate lesi -- legislative correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.098" offset="11436784">But in 1960, Mr. Gash, in a speech referred to in the article of Professor Comisar, cited in our brief, took the position that Mallory had actually contributed to an improvement in law enforcement work in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.987" offset="11488298">That because they had been trained to observe the Mallory rule, the District of Columbia were laying more emphasis on pre-arrest investigation where interrogation is not subject to any serious question of principle and were making better cases and relying less on confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.250" offset="11557366">Now, it is also significant, I think, that the Justice Department apparently takes the view that affording the opportunity to talk -- call a lawyer and talk to him before you're interrogated would not cripple law enforcement because this is the position reflected in certain amendments proposed by the Justice Department to House Bill 7565 or is it 7525, now in the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.824" offset="11647645">That bill has not yet been reported out but indications are and advised that the Senate will incorporate the amendments proposed by the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.375" offset="11677947">In conclusion, it seems to me that the predictions of a breakdown in law enforcement should be taken with a grain of salt, to put it mildly by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.017" offset="11712428">These are extravagant predictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.993" offset="11720370">I do not candidly suggest that it is possible on the facts available to us now to say that these predictions are correct or that the opposite predictions are correct, that a more restrictive rule would contribute to more efficient police work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.425" offset="11774077">I do say that the suggestion in the state's brief that we would have a breakdown in law enforcement is an assumption which is not based on facts and that there is no sufficient showing to justify the kind of unfairness --</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.336" offset="12421705">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, and counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.978" offset="12452321">This case involves the crime of murder for hire, the defendant before the Court, Daniel Escobedo, being the one who counseled the commission of murder for hire by his codefendant, Benedict DiGerlando.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.374" offset="12505924">He was found guilty by a jury and sentenced by that jury to a term of 20 years in Illinois State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.758" offset="12539465">There are two issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.347" offset="12545735">First, whether or not under all of the circumstances of the case, the confession of Escobedo to the state's attorney, at about 11:50 pm on the night that he was arrested for the last time was voluntary or as sometimes I think put in the brief and the argument here whether under the totality of circumstances he might have been overreached or whether under the totality of circumstances, there was fundamental unfairness because of the presence or absence of a number of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.675" offset="12671122">And the second issue specifically raised in the petition for certiorari and in all the briefs and upon which this Court granted certiorari was whether or not the absence of counsel or the refusal to allow the defendant to consult with counsel before he confessed compels by itself the exclusion of the confession and whether or not Crooker versus California and Cicenia versus Lagay should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.581" offset="12766730">Now, as to the first issue, I think the discussion of the various factors which the defendant says go to the voluntariness of the confession are fairly well done in detail in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.693" offset="12815214">Let me go at once to some of the questions raised by Your Honors during the argument of opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.528" offset="12846456">I think the first one that ought to be dealt with is whether or not this case is distinguishable from Haynes against Washington, the latest confession case to be handed down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.079" offset="12880729">I think that it is, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.105" offset="12892850">First, I think we're only forced to even approach a Haynes versus Washington kind of situation because of the first opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.239" offset="12941333">If there had been no first opinion in this case, I think it pretty clear that we would not need to discuss Haynes and its applicability at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.619" offset="12970904">But there was a first opinion and that first opinion did find or conclude, one judge dissenting an opinion to follow, that promises were made to Escobedo that if he confessed he would be used only as a witness and allowed to go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.140" offset="13032970">Now if that was true, if the evidence in the record supports that position and that finding, then there is no question but that that confession could not be used under the rule of Haynes and under the rule of Lynumn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.841" offset="13079782">There's no dispute about that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.935" offset="13088141">The central question now, it seems to me, is whether or not there was any evidentiary support for the finding of the first opinion or whether we must confine ourselves solely to the conclusions of the second opinion which is after all the official opinion now of the Illinois Supreme Court in which we review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.808" offset="13151671">It seems to me that the first opinion found evidences of promises or could have found evidences of promises only by believing the testimony of the defendant on a motion to suppress and disbelieving the only officer to whom promises were attributed, Officer Montejano.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.793" offset="13235576">Now, I don't need to cite the decisions of the Illinois Supreme Court or indeed the decisions of any State Supreme Court for the proposition that on review, courts of review will not reweigh questions of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.800" offset="13283641">In their brief in this Court, the defendant has conceded that promises were specific or said that promises were specifically made by Montejano and has conceded that specific denials were given by Montejano.</text>

            <text syncTime="4302.272" offset="17313499">And the opinion specifically refers to an oral confession made shortly after the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4621.838" offset="18591723">The first is that this was not a case of arrest with warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.508" offset="18602381">It was the case of arrest without warrant and Escobedo, himself, specifically testified that at record 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.291" offset="18629548">It is true that the same trial judge which refused to suppress Escobedo's confession, suppressed Chan's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.959" offset="18668210">And although he attempted to distinguish the two cases, I would not for one moment, suggest to Your Honors that the two cases can be distinguished with any meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.331" offset="18709692">And all I can say to Your Honors is that, in suppressing Chan's confession, the trial judge was wrong and that the only person harmed by that error was the state because then they were forced to nolle the case against Chan and he was not convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.625" offset="18766848">It does not follow, however, I -- as I think the petitioner seems to imply, that this Court should compound the error by also suppressing Escobedo's confession because as we all know, two wrongs do not make a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.601" offset="18818779">And the suppression of Escobedo's confession in this case, I don't think, would be a right result, so that we are not governed by the error made by the judge as to codefendant, Chan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.552" offset="18854619">And it is not true that Escobedo was represented by the public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.901" offset="18871965">Escobedo was represented by private counsel, Mr. Novak, at the time of the motion to suppress because the public defender had withdrawn prior to the decision on the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.579" offset="18918672">There was also a question raised about the participation of the state's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.945" offset="18936226">The evidence is I think clear that the particular state's attorney, Mr. Cooper, who took the confession did not know that the attorney was attempting to see the defendant in the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.409" offset="18978022">As a matter of constitutional law, when we get to the second issue, I don't think that has relevance by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.607" offset="19002786">It is of course, offensive to us as lawyers to think that one lawyer, a government lawyer, would tell another lawyer “go get a writ” or use some other expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.887" offset="19043955">I don't think our sensibilities as lawyers, particularly can govern this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4782.271" offset="19233499">Now, there is some question raised that Cicenia was a -- in a different posture before this Court for the constitutional issue reached because there was not a plea of not guilty in that case with a contested issue on the confession but, rather, what New Jersey call a plea of non vult.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.150" offset="19297029">But as I understand the majority opinion in the Cicenia case, the issue before the Court on the validity of the confession because of the absence of the counsel was the same as it would have been had there been a plea of not guilty and had the issue gone to trial on a motion to suppress because there was reference made in the majority opinion in Cicenia in a footnote to the case of Herman against Claudy which seems to imply that where there is a coerced or incompetent confession which precedes a plea of guilty, then the court may still reexamine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.726" offset="19435269">In fact that doctrine is involved in a case now pending before this Court, also from Illinois, on the question of whether or not a plea of guilty forecloses an independent reexamination of constitutional violations that may have preceded the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.266" offset="19489499">And we took the position in Illinois in that case, and we take the position here in our answer, that a plea of guilty will not always foreclose consideration of constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.267" offset="19529415">And as I understand Cicenia, the court in that case was taking the same position that the plea of non vult did not foreclose an independent examination of whether or not that confession, I suppose, was a circumstance that prompted the plea of non vult if it was in fact, incompetent because no lawyer was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.216" offset="19601304">So, if the legal issues are the same, it's clear to me that the facts of this case cannot be distinguished from the facts of Cicenia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.645" offset="19630979">The ages of the petitioner are substantially similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.668" offset="19643099">He consulted with an attorney before he went to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.200" offset="19657206">The attorney was present at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.981" offset="19664311">He asked to see his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.223" offset="19669326">The client asked to see him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.620" offset="19674864">Admission was refused and the confession followed, and those are the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.147" offset="19692941">So, I think that if this Court is to decide the case on the broader issue of whether or not the question is incompetent because of the lack of counsel, Cicenia must be overruled, Crooker must be overruled and certainly, the cases of Baker and Groban, the language in the majority opinions must also be severely limited.</text>

            <text syncTime="4977.661" offset="20015083">As I remember, of both Groban and Baker, and certainly Groban, there was the element of compulsion of being held in contempt if you did not go in and answer questions without a counsel which, of course, is not present in a police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.691" offset="20059178">Be that as it may, I think this Court, on examination of the record by itself will conclude as did the Illinois Supreme Court the second time around, that the confessions were voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="5005.027" offset="20124484">I don't think there is any question under the intervening decisions of this Court, since Crooker and Cicenia and notably, Gideon versus Wainwright, that if this Court were to hold that Danny Escobedo had a constitutional right to consult with his counsel at the police station upon request, then that constitutional right is not only extended to Escobedo who had money enough to retain counsel and who had retained counsel banging at the precinct doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.848" offset="20239736">That constitutional right, it seems to me cannot help but to be extended to a man who does not have the money for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.813" offset="20263664">This Court said in Gideon that all persons, at least in felony cases, are entitled to the appointment of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="5453.968" offset="21920246">Well, to answer that, there's no doubt that this Court has the power to hold that, as a part of Fourteenth Amendment due process, if a state's lawyer participates in the investigation, that is the stage at which counsel must be given to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.186" offset="21973117">You can hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.619" offset="21978864">And there is, as you say, a policy argument for holding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.876" offset="21991926">I would be of the different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.235" offset="21997359">I would take the position, and the State of Illinois takes the position, that the mere interjection of a state's attorney at the end essentially of the interrogation process to take the final confession is not such an interjection of the adversary system that requires the appointment of counsel for the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.796" offset="22063606">And let me make one point in conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.640" offset="22074995">It should be very clear that we're not talking merely about an opportunity to consult counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5499.352" offset="22101849">Now, it's true, as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, that I ended up my brief by saying if Danny Escobedo had consulted counsel, he would not have confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.809" offset="22131628">Perhaps that's a little too broad, but the concurring opinion in Spano and the New York decisions make very clear that it is not the absence of consultation with counsel that is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.772" offset="22179485">It is the absence of counsel that is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.643" offset="22194949">And so, I take it that if Mr. Justice Stewart's concurring opinion were the majority view, if the question arose again, that a man under indictment who clearly has the right to counsel who was questioned at all by the police, no matter how many times he had consulted with counsel since his indictment, if the confession came in the absence of counsel, and those were the words used in that concurring opinion, “the absence of counsel”, the confession would be incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.204" offset="22297245">So, if this Court were to hold that a defendant under arrest and in -- under interrogation in a police department has the right to counsel, this Court must hold the confession incompetent in the absence of counsel which means, essentially, there will be no more confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.346" offset="22353774">Thank you.</text>
