            <text syncTime="32.043" offset="231528">This case arises under Section 9 of the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.841" offset="266742">That Section and its predecessor provisions which go back constant -- continually to 1940 draft act give veterans certain reemployment rights on their return from military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.145" offset="324002">Stating the facts of the case requires making clear the relationship between three of the many categories of employees in the railroads, maintenance and repair shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.591" offset="377710">The first category is that of carman.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.467" offset="389204">Carman does the most skilled work of the three.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.766" offset="402474">Gets paid the highest pay and has its own seniority roster.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.546" offset="425566">The second category is that of carman helper that does less skilled work, gets paid on a lower scale and has -- the carman helpers have their own seniority roster.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.234" offset="480319">The third category is something of a hybrid between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.623" offset="501844">Because of shortages among carmen, sometimes helpers are upgraded to do carman's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.180" offset="528071">An upgraded carman helper does carman's work, gets paid a carman's wage but doesn't obtain carman's seniority until he's worked 1040 days, “a 1040-day training period as an upgraded carman helper.”</text>
            <text syncTime="121.670" offset="590033">In the meantime, he retains his seniority as a helper and he also obtains something very much like seniority as an upgraded helper.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.450" offset="629217">He gets a date when he's upgraded and that date determines his right to demand work as a carman, work towards 1040 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.577" offset="673729">In terms of these three categories, the facts of the case can be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.087" offset="695672">Tilton, Beck and McClearn were already upgraded helpers when they went into the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.354" offset="720750">The only discretion that management has had been exercised at that point in their -- where there is apparently discretion in upgrading but they'd already been upgraded.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.460" offset="765262">During the time they were in military service, they were passed in the number of days work towards 1040-day requirement by a number of junior upgraded helpers who would've had a subordinate right to work had these veterans been present.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.815" offset="1002663">But -- when -- because they were passed by when they return and completed their 1040 days of work, they found that formerly junior upgraded helpers already had carman status and seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.537" offset="1069537">They asked to have their seniority dates set back so that they would maintain the same relative seniority position with regard to these people that they had had when they were -- when they had gone into the military service, at the time when they were all upgraded helpers.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.240" offset="1128364">The employer refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.482" offset="1137351">The suit resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.516" offset="1145396">The District Court held for the employer and the Court of Appeals affirmed saying in substance that the veteran can only claim on his return what would've been his absolutely, certainly and forseeably at the time he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.823" offset="1222614">As it were the employees to be -- the veterans to be treated as if he had been on leave of absence and accrued only those rights which are near functions of lapse of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.867" offset="1278830">I'd like to begin my argument by stating what we conceived to be the issue of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.576" offset="1301713">One of the central functions of Section 9, perhaps the central function is to grant to veterans, as a matter of statutory right, those benefits of seniority in position that would've come to them as a matter of contract right had they not been away in military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.336" offset="1380707">In the words of this Court, in the words of Section 9 (c) (2), had they been continuously employed and I -- I now use those words in quote so I don't mean to say anything by them, had they not been away.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.276" offset="1428459">Perhaps the most important of these benefits of seniority in position is the relative seniority position of the veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.859" offset="1466807">The importance of this benefit of course flows from a large number of other rights that are a function of relative seniority position.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.547" offset="1501602">Security on the jobs, security against layoffs, preferences in work, vacation times, each of these is a function of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.367" offset="1540890">The issue in this case is whether the veteran is entitled to be protected in his relative seniority position not only in the position he left but also in the position to which he and his fellow employees have advanced and been able to claim as a matter of right on completion of a 1040-day work period.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.361" offset="1620825">Our contention is very simply that the seniority these veterans claim would've been theirs a matter of contract right had they have been continuously employed in a sense of continuously present and on the job whenever they would've had a right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.007" offset="1695431">The Eighth Circuit agreed that they would've had a right to a seniority position they claim had they have been continuously present and on the job whenever they had a right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.216" offset="1740257">But the Eighth Circuit said that when this Court has said, “continuously employed” or when we're trying to figure out where the veteran would've been -- had he not been absent in military service, he's not entitled to be treated as if he had been at work whenever he had a right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.324" offset="1800652">He should be treated as if he had been on leave of absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.608" offset="1813817">Now, that that frame is the issue as we see it, does continuously employed means continuously on leave of absence, or continuously at work when the veteran had a right to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.762" offset="2518392">There's no place at all where management discretion comes into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.398" offset="2540962">The question is whether the infirmities of what -- of being a human being which can interfere with work when a man has a right to work, prevent him from maintaining his relative position.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.911" offset="2591013">But I'd like to go to furlough and leave of absence, if -- if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.490" offset="2605328">I was going to go on to say that the heart of our case is that the Tilton case is almost a mirror copy of a case decided by this -- by this Court in favor of the veteran after full briefing and oral argument in 1955, Diehl versus Lehigh Valley Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.151" offset="2696025">Now, that's a square precedent as -- as one can have.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.741" offset="2718386">In Diehl, like as here -- oh, let me take -- let me use the name Diehl.Diehl like Tilton was an upgraded carman helper when he went into military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.166" offset="2771989">Diehl like Tilton apparently had rights -- had prior rights to work when work -- when carman's work was available over those who had been upgraded after him.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.801" offset="2814621">He was passed because of his service time.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.922" offset="2831026">On his return, the employer and the union entered into a collective bargaining agreement saying that upgraded helpers should be given carman's status and seniority after 1160 days of work instead of 1040 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.951" offset="2899153">Diehl claimed that his date should be set back to preserve his relative position.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.010" offset="2927365">He should be given the position he would've -- he had when he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.502" offset="2945337">The Third Circuit -- the employer refused, the District Court agreed with the employer in grounds very much like those in the Eighth Circuit opinion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.572" offset="2981700">The Third Circuit affirmed saying, in a way that reflects Justice Stewart's question, the Third Circuit said, “If this man is entitled to be treated as if he were continuously employed” and the Third Circuit said, “That's the language the Supreme Court has used in Oakley,” that was one of the leading preceding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.375" offset="3068844">If he's entitled to be treated as continuously employed in the language that Congress used in 9 (c) (2) then Diehl was entitled to be given credit, given the seniority position he claims because he would have had it if he was continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.590" offset="3133733">However, we believe the leave of absence in furlough language controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.606" offset="3153795">There was full argument and full briefing in this Court of Appeals -- this Court reversed per curiam citing Oakley where the Court had said that the veteran should be treated as if he'd been continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.931" offset="3215130">Now, we know of no distinction between the Diehl case and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.500" offset="3241357">The respondents have suggested that maybe this Court thought in Diehl that the 1160-day period wasn't actually a work period but that's simply impossible in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.705" offset="3282213">The Court of Appeals had called it an experience period repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.327" offset="3300707">In there briefs in this Court, the parties made absolutely clear that the 1160-day period was a required work period.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.065" offset="3335607">The Eighth Circuit suggest that Diehl maybe different because there was a stipulation upon what date Diehl would've completed his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.431" offset="3377089">One answer to this is I think, the Eighth Circuit was misled in thinking there was -- unintentionally misled in thinking there was a stipulation, there wasn't stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.291" offset="3408541">The facts were that Diehl had alleged that he would complete his work on a certain date and his complaint was dismissed and for purposes of the complaint it was taken as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.415" offset="3449083">But this was by no means equivalent to taking as true what was palpably and always will be untrue and that is that there are -- that there were no contingencies that could interfere with Diehl's completion of his work period.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.623" offset="3505821">Obviously, sickness and even number of things could.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.315" offset="3524629">Now, since we believe that the Diehl case is this case, the only question is whether the -- this Court's only case since Diehl, the McKinney case overruled Diehl.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.348" offset="3584815">I -- I would be inclined to think that that was at the heart of the Eighth Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.916" offset="3602996">The Eighth Circuit wasn't really trying to say that Diehl was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.317" offset="3616684">It ended up saying if -- how Diehl and McKinney are irreconcilable, it's up to the Supreme Court to say so and not us.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.594" offset="3653778">But McKinney didn't have anything to do with what is continuous employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.407" offset="3673004">McKinney was concerned with the very different issue, whether the veteran is entitled to claim as a matter of statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.777" offset="3714487">Everything that he would -- the he probably would've obtained had he been “continuously employed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="910.303" offset="3744580">And here I can just put those words continuously employed in quotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.870" offset="3754820">McKinney doesn't talk about what continuously employed means even though some of these benefits that he probably would've obtained would've been in the discretion of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.816" offset="3794631">Or, was the veteran only entitled to what he could have claimed as a matter of right under the collective bargaining agreement or customs of the parties, had he been continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.113" offset="3847816">This was the position of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.608" offset="3857847">The McKinney facts indicated that the employer's discretion was required for a promotion that McKinney was asking that McKinney was asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.728" offset="3902255">The Government argued in behalf of McKinney that he probably would've gotten the promotion in the employer's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.062" offset="3931617">The railroad responded, “He can only claim it if it could've had it as a matter of right had he been continuously employed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="963.447" offset="3957112">It distinguish Diehl saying that the Diehl was entirely consistent with their -- with their position in McKinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.423" offset="3985115">Diehl, the railroad said was entitled to the seniority he claimed as a matter of right had he been continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.255" offset="4016358">McKinney wouldn't have had any right to the promotion he claimed even if he had been continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.805" offset="4042585">This Court adopted the railroad's position in McKinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.495" offset="4061393">Oh, that's right, the railroad's position in McKinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.758" offset="4074454">It said that the veteran can only claim what have -- what have been his as a matter of right, had he been continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.718" offset="4110294">It continued to use the very language of continuous employment that this Court had used in Oakley which had been interpreted in Diehl to mean continuous -- continuous presence on the job whenever the veteran would've had a right to work and it stated and which was now incorporated in 9 (c) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.914" offset="4211022">There is absolutely no indication that intended to overrule Diehl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.993" offset="4227323">Diehl, I should point out was not even mentioned in McKinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.303" offset="4240593">It's not even cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.338" offset="4260760">I should -- I'd only like to add that I think that the result we contend for in this case is almost dictated by the McKinney decision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.779" offset="4310497">McKinney had an alternative claim that he would've been entitled to his promotion as a matter of right had he been continuously present on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.347" offset="4348740">This, he said was the actual way that collective bargaining agreement had been interpreted by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.411" offset="4372982">The Court agreed that if he was entitled to his promotion as a matter of right and not discretion, he should get it and remand it to allow him to try to prove that's what the collective bargaining agreement meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.251" offset="4420420">Well, what our veterans are claiming in this case is the improvement in status that would've cont -- that they had a right to claim had they been continuously employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.382" offset="4468903">Their status as upgraded helpers improves everyday they work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.112" offset="4487816">They move towards carman everyday they work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.013" offset="4499414">They had contract rights to work ahead of those junior to them exactly the same as McKinney's claim, contract right to be promoted ahead of those junior to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.892" offset="4542986">And we're just claiming that they should be given the benefits of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.208" offset="4564198">I would like to reserve whatever the time I have Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.413" offset="4612995">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.363" offset="4628773">I want to compliment Mr. Heymann on a very fair presentation of the facts and the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.010" offset="4659388">And I'll try to avoid repeating too much but I think it is essential to have a clear understanding of the facts in the case and what the court below found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.533" offset="4705468">In the first place, there were these two entirely distinct classifications of work under the collective bargain agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.759" offset="4742457">One was the carman helper and the other was the carman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.990" offset="4763355">Now these veterans were classified before they went into military service, after they went in the -- after they came back from military service as carman helpers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.077" offset="4807659">They were not classified as carmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.414" offset="4821034">These two classes of work had different job descriptions which were provided in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.495" offset="4849351">The carman helper was confined to doing the unskilled tasks involving repair of cars and the carman was a skilled craftsman who had all the responsibilities such as the master carpenter has in building a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.136" offset="4915911">The carman helper never had the right to do the carman's work and the carman never had the right to do the carman helper's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.367" offset="4948825">These were entirely different categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.346" offset="4960737">There were separate seniority as providers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.672" offset="4974111">The carman helper was on one list and the carmen journeymen were on entirely separate list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.882" offset="5014862">These veterans then had no seniority whatever as carmen when they went into military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.329" offset="5040671">They had no way, there was no possible way under the contract for them to do carmen's work or to transfer to a carman's seniority escalator except under the provisions of the specific agreement that was adopted in December 1953 between the collective bargaining agent and the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.255" offset="5136384">And that is what I want to get into primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.830" offset="5150699">I'd like to mention before that that this -- this Court has recognized that seniority is not inherent in the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.110" offset="5187793">It is a matter of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.331" offset="5196675">Seniority grows out of contract and contract alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.250" offset="5220394">I might quote this one statement in the case of Aeronautical Lodge against Campbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.585" offset="5257697">"Barring legislation not here involved, seniority rights derive their scope and their significance from union contracts, confined as they are almost exclusively to unionized industry."</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.818" offset="5310673">Now, what was the contract of 1953?</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.522" offset="5329481">First of all, it said when the qualified carmen were not available, then, the railroad could utilize the services of the helper to do the carmen's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.928" offset="5391130">It was only when these qualified carmen were not available that these helpers could work as carmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.003" offset="5419342">And that vary with conditions, jobs maybe cut off and there would be ample carmen available or jobs might be added to the situation at a particular point and there would be fewer carmen and therefore more helpers would be able to do the carmen's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.425" offset="5505024">It provided also that if they were selected to do the carmen's work, and incidentally, an answer to your question Mr. Justice Goldberg, they were selected on a basis that they have the aptitude and were willing to take over the job, they were not considered qualified at all as carmen when they started out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.890" offset="5598960">They were just like beginning apprentices who were beginning their apprenticeship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.513" offset="5625396">It provided that if they were selected to do this carman's work, they would retain their helper's seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.453" offset="5657161">They did not go over on the carmen help -- on the carmen's seniority list and they were not considered qualified carmen at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.324" offset="5716720">Having retained their helper's seniority, they could exercise it at anytime they chose to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.151" offset="5743992">In other words, they didn't have to take this carman's work that became available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.856" offset="5762800">They could go back to working as a helper and many times they did that very thing because they might have a better hour, you see they were higher up on the carman helpers list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.157" offset="5803969">They were at the very bottom of the -- of the working group of carman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.999" offset="5823404">They could only take the worst positions as carmen and so they might have better hours, they might even work more overtime so that they would earn more pay as helpers and sometimes they did exercise their helper seniority in preference to doing the carman's work.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip B. Heymann</label>
            <text syncTime="2697.558" offset="10893563">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.232" offset="10912266">I'd like to address myself to three things I hope without to a great length and rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.227" offset="10944240">First, I hope it's clear that we of course are not claiming that the veteran could use his military service as time that would actually satisfy the employer's requirement of a training period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.326" offset="11004635">He had to complete that when he got back, I think Justice Goldberg stated the position as -- that we are espousing and that is that for -- only for seniority purposes, he's entitled to have this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.730" offset="11058343">In line with this, I'd like to say something about 1948 House bill that was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.293" offset="11080495">There are lots of reasons why Congress can choose one bill rather than another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.295" offset="11100557">I think it's almost not worth speculating when they both are -- when they both grant a similar protection as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.211" offset="11140263">But I would like to point out that the House bill would've given the veteran the right to be promoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.014" offset="11163460">Not just have seniority date reflect the promotion but to be promoted, although the employer only wanted trained men on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.198" offset="11196165">Now that's a good enough reason for me to explain why the House bill was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.042" offset="11215496">And another reason that is mentioned in the Senate Report is that Congress didn't want to grant veterans after 1948 rights that might take precedents over what they've granted before 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.521" offset="11265442">A neat way of avoiding doing that was to declare it sense and its -- and declare its sense in terms that this Court had used those with continuous employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.552" offset="11309537">That's my first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.899" offset="11318941">My second point is I think that the -- the heart of the case can be stated more adequately now than before when I was standing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.479" offset="11357288">McKinney definitely holds that the employee can't claim what is in the discretion of the employer to withhold from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.529" offset="11389471">What would've been in the discretion of the employer to withhold them had he not been -- had he -- even had he been present on the job, that's certainly the heart of McKinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.425" offset="11429073">It also -- it also holds that the veteran can claim on his return a promotion that he could've had on the basis of seniority alone had he been present on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.673" offset="11478079">He can claim what he would've had as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.702" offset="11498141">Now, what this case is about -- in -- in this case, the veterans are claiming the -- the increase in status which comes with exercising the rights they had in their absence to work as carmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.735" offset="11562297">Justice McKinney exercised -- McKinney claimed that he was deprived of his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.206" offset="11584240">This Court found it was probably discretionary about his right to a promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.767" offset="11606392">These veterans are claiming the benefits of the rights they had to work during their absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.481" offset="11637321">What the case is about is whether -- it's agreed that the veteran -- it's agreed that veterans can claim what would've been theirs as a matter of right had they been present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.953" offset="11679222">It's agreed they can't claim what would have been theirs only as a matter of discretion had they been present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.519" offset="11701478">This case is about what happens to the acts of nature that fall in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.213" offset="11724257">These veterans had a right to claim work on everyday but they had no right not to be sick nor it was not -- sickness was not a matter of discretion and not a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.504" offset="11773367">What happens to those -- what happens to the things that could've interfered with what the -- the veteran claims but is not interference as a matter of employee or his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.596" offset="11825716">To that, we answer that the Diehl case has said that if the only thing as long as what the veteran is claiming depends only upon as being treated as if he had worked when he had a right to work, he's entitled to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.258" offset="11896456">This we say is the holding of Diehl.</text>
