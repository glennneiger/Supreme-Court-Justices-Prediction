            <text syncTime="459.012" offset="1939414">Well, it depends on what is required to convert it to the other size.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.460" offset="1961253">Now, here, in order to convert the original machines, after they had been cleaned up to the 5-ounce can handling size, it was necessary to either resize or relocated six parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.650" offset="2033977">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit characterized the total number of parts as being in the order of 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.755" offset="2062399">This would cover essential parts, and I use the word “essential” in the sense that the parts which are essential are recited in the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.649" offset="2097925">They are elements of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.447" offset="2105135">35, undoubtedly, includes both essential and non-essential parts but the 35 parts were in the machines which embodied the patented entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.062" offset="2155604">Now, the Court might be interested in the extent to which each of the five claims of the patent was affected by the changes of the six parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.945" offset="2219133">Now, for example, claim one was directed or is directed to the combination of nine elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.024" offset="2255496">When I say elements, I should explain it further in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.285" offset="2276498">It calls for means for delivering produce to the receivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.446" offset="2293112">Now, the means may embrace a number of elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.394" offset="2304920">It calls for a plurality of radially disposed arms, so that were -- when we're talking about nine elements, we're really talking about nine classes of elements here.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.581" offset="2345671">And, out of those nine classes of elements called for in claim one, six out of nine were either resized or relocated in order to adapt these machines to handle the smaller cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.152" offset="2400005">Claim two calls for the combination of some-seven groups of elements and, in order to modify the machines to handle the smaller cans, three out of those seven groups of elements were modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.409" offset="2473044">Claim three calls for a combination of four groups of elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.427" offset="2489031">It is interesting, I believe, to advise the Court that no one of the four elements of claim three was affected by these resizing or relocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.950" offset="2543156">Claim four calls for a combination of seven groups of elements, three of which were modified as to size or location.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.173" offset="2576071">Claim five calls for five groups of elements, three out of the five having been either resized or relocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.461" offset="2617240">Now, as I represent it to the Court and as the record and the findings will bear out, the four machines in question were sold outright and unconditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.316" offset="2676590">Hence, they had become fully released from the patent monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.886" offset="2698951">This Court has held that many times in connection with cases of this general type and cases which are fairly closely related, among such cases, the earlier -- among such earlier cases of this type decided by this Court was the case of Chappie versus Boston Building wherein, and I'll just quote briefly from the Court's opinion, “by a valid sale and purchase, the patented machine becomes the private individual property of the purchaser and is no longer protected by the laws of United States but by the laws of the state in which it is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.381" offset="2860910">Hence, it is obvious that if a person legally acquires a title to that which is the subject of letters patent, he may continue to use it until it is worn out or he may repair it or improve upon it as he pleases in the same manner as if dealing with property of any other kind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="708.333" offset="2936665">In other words, having been fully released from the patent monopoly, the machines in question took upon the full and complete nature of general personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.106" offset="2983790">As an owner of general personal property, I may destroy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.467" offset="2997269">I may do anything I wish with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.254" offset="3012420">Here, the machines were not destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.577" offset="3025690">Instead, they were cleaned up to put them into operative use and less than the entire patented entity was modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.585" offset="3077726">To me, the courts below took the wrong bend in the road at this juncture and when the District Court said that it is the right of the patentee to either put the invention of his patent into use or not to put it into use, and this is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.839" offset="3182738">This has been decided by this Court in the Paper Bag case.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.247" offset="3476355">Now, in the Motion Picture case, their movie projectors were sold outright in the sense that the seller obtained the full consideration for the equipment but he put a notice on the equipment saying “limited to the use with film to the -- to use with films covered by another patent owned by the seller of the equipment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="867.884" offset="3574888">And, just like the District Court here, the Court there -- I think both courts there, both the district and the court of -- the Appellate Court held that that was already -- it could attach such a condition to the use of that equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.813" offset="3642598">However, the Court said this, and they had reference to the decision by the court immediately below which had approved that type of an arrangement, “This decision proceeds upon the argument that, since the patentee may withhold his patent all together from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="918.300" offset="3776554">The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting of inference and argument for the language of the statute and from failure to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an infringement proceeding and rights which he may create for himself by private contract which, however, are subject to the rules of general as distinguished from those of the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.609" offset="3885850">While it is true that under the statute, it says they were and now are, a patentee might withhold his patented machine from public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.091" offset="3919705">Yet, if he consented to use it himself or through others, such use immediately fell within the terms of the statute and, as we have seen, he is thereby restricted to the use of the invention as it is described in the claims of his patent and not as it may be expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it imposed by mere notice to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.838" offset="4014686">And, I might carry the Motion Picture case one point further in this sense, that it perhaps is even closer to the case at bar than the Aro case because, while respondent here is really complaining about a making in the sent -- in the sense of a reconstruction, at bottom, what he is really complaining about is a conversion of the machine to a new use, which new use was never made in the machine by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.171" offset="4132028">In that sense, named -- in talking about 1-pound cans, and so forth, as compared to 5-ounce cans, this case is not unlike, in too great a sense, the motion picture case because they are now talking about the materials that go through or which are processed by the machines covered by the patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.628" offset="4473919">However, it referred to the District Court's decision as a well-reasoned one and the Circuit Court fell in with the First Co -- Circuit and the Eighth Circuit where you -- where the courts were faced with the matter of resizing or relocating or enhancing capacity of patented machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.709" offset="4566183">In the George Close versus Ideal Machinery Company case, which is a First Circuit case, you had a candy-wrapping machine adapted as it was made and sold to wrap -- to cut and wrap caramels of a specific size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.258" offset="4632430">The owner of the machine changed the machine by re-spacing the cutting knives and whatever else was involved so that it would produce a slightly larger caramel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.904" offset="4683003">And, of course, he was charged with infringement, suit ensued, both courts held that that type of thing amounted to an infringement by way of reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.170" offset="4736084">But, there, the First Circuit, they said the test was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.541" offset="4757504">The test was whether the identity of the machine had been changed and they -- the court equated change in identity with change in capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.952" offset="4803166">Whereas, in reality, when we're talking about what is covered by a patent, identity has reference to the patent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.397" offset="4853008">The court made no reference -- no controlling reference to the claims in that case, neither did it do so, that is the Eighth Circuit Court, in a fairly parallel case entitled “Miller Hatcheries versus Buckeye.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.841" offset="4902745">There, you had a matter of enhancing the capacity of an egg incubator by adding things and relocating elements and that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.846" offset="4946735">So, our position here is this that neither court below has properly applied the criteria which call for application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.116" offset="4987800">And, in failing to do so, both courts below have violated the constitutional standard as to the -- as to protection of the rights of inventors and, of course, the implementing statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.506" offset="5377442">No, these very same machines which were originally made for the 1-pound tall cans, Mr. Chief Justice, were in the hands of two -- of sardine packers up and down the west coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.475" offset="5429269">Now, I wouldn't be here today had not the sardines disappeared from the Monterey area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.154" offset="5447973">That's what caused the canneries to close down in Cannery Row.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.038" offset="5463542">And, the available machine -- the available sardines, excuse me, became a little smaller so they wa -- required smaller containers to pack them in and so, after this episode of the closing down of the Hovden Packing Plant, some of the packing plants in Los Angeles area, Del Monte area, remained in operation but they, too, required that their machines be adapted to fill a 5-ounce can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.730" offset="5562284">Now, they went to Mr. Kuther, the respondent here, and paid him money to receive permission to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.889" offset="5590915">Now, when I say though that both of the courts below have violated the constitutional provisions and the implementing statute, this is what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.607" offset="5625814">Article I, Section 8, of the constitution gives the sole power to Congress to protect, for a limited time, the rights of inventors to their respective discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.549" offset="5677537">And, under that constitutional provision, there has been a whole succession of patent Acts commencing in 1790.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.519" offset="5717452">The key ones were 1790, 1836, and 1870, and the latest in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.658" offset="5742007">Now, the statute, 35 -- Title 35, United States Code, Section 154 defines what the grant of a patent means and it means that the patentee is given the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling his invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.005" offset="5827375">Section 271 (a) refers to infringement and says “he who, without authority, makes or uses or sells an invention shall be liable for infringement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.199" offset="5880142">So, that we have this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.375" offset="5888920">There are three ways in which a patent can be infringed - making, using, or selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.525" offset="5909504">Now, Section 112 requires the applicant for a patent to particularly point out and distinctly claim his patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.839" offset="5942732">That's the patent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.080" offset="5947643">It's like a real estate deed in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.458" offset="5961226">So that, when all those are taken together, and it's always the claim which is looked to, to see whether there has been a making, or using, or selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.382" offset="6000933">Now, so that you cannot have a making by way of reconstruction unless you have the entire patented entity or the entire combination remade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.625" offset="6053909">That I think is the full sense of Mr. Justice Black's concurring opinion in the recent Aro case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.752" offset="6086405">He -- Mr. Justice Black did advert to this marginal type of thing where, perhaps all else except a bolt and a nut might be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.568" offset="6129664">But he said “Let us leave that to the time when we reach a situation like that,” but that is not this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.008" offset="6155368">As I have pointed out to the Court, in respect of each of the five claims of the patent in suit, at least two to three essential elements of the combination were left unmodified and, hence, unmade by the activities of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.946" offset="6219107">And, we say that this cannot amount to reconstruction or infringement by way of reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.926" offset="6251081">That to reach such a conclusion is to accord or confer patent monopoly on something which was not the discovery of Mr. Kuther.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.477" offset="6293295">He didn't discover the sub-combination, namely, the six out of the nine elements which were modified with respect to claim one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.329" offset="6332688">If he had discovered it, he should've claimed it, but he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.238" offset="6348361">So, to say that claim one or any one of the other five claims ha -- we're infringed by the modifying activities of the petitioners is to confer patent monopoly where it is not deserving to be conferred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.982" offset="6471346">Yes, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.560" offset="6477615">These claims refer to packing machines completely independent of the size or capacity of the cans which go through them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.803" offset="6514604">The cans are not an element of any one of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.943" offset="6527143">The claims are referred to by way of background or environmental description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.060" offset="6559640">So that, both before and afterwards, the 1-pound packing machine and the 5-ounce packing machine were embraced by the language of the claims but, as I pointed out earlier, by virtue of the outright and unconditional sale, the machine, in the 1-pound sense at least, had been fully and for all time released from the patent monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.055" offset="6659636">Now, the question is did the machine get back into the patent monopoly so as to require a further royalty, and that only raises this question as to whether there was a remaking in the sense of substantially the entire patented entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.843" offset="6726719">This, we submit, did not occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.871" offset="6822849">The knob of our case is that the petitioners here have made additional unauthorized exploitation of respondent's patent without any obligation to respondent for this increased exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.787" offset="6906546">The facts of this case are quite simple and authority had been stated in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.272" offset="6936430">As far as the patent is concerned, I again want to emphasize that it does cover a 1-pound machine or a one -- or a 5-ounce machine or any other sized can machine that acts in the way described in the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.623" offset="6997870">It's the same as in the Aro case wherein the claims weren't limited to Chevrolet's or to Ford cars or any other specific cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.156" offset="7048025">Now, what happened here originally was that respondent or rather respondent's licensee, I -- if I may, I will refer to them both as respondent because they're essentially the same person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.226" offset="7112286">They made four 1-poundmachines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.696" offset="7126183">That's all these machines could do, was pack 1-pound cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.332" offset="7144678">They're in no way adjustable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.268" offset="7152410">It could pack no other sized can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.610" offset="7165785">These machines were bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.345" offset="7172786">The purchase price for the machines of course would include two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.787" offset="7190549">They would include the sale of the physical machine and then they would include the royalty for the use of these machines to practice respondent's invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.283" offset="7260453">Now, the patent rights which passed by the sale of a machine are well defined by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.070" offset="7291695">First of all, a sale of a patented machine does not convey all the rights of a patentee that he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.461" offset="7333177">The rights are specific to the particular machine that is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.765" offset="7350418">The buyer of the machine gets the right to use that machine to practice the invention for as long as the machine is operable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.891" offset="7390960">If the machine needs repair, the owner may repair it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.577" offset="7413635">That's clear from the Aro case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.096" offset="7427741">However, if the machine is destroyed, again as from the Aro case, the license which ran with the machine comes to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.129" offset="7483852">The purchase of a machine does not give the purchaser the right to make a second machine.That, I believe, too, is clear from the Aro case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4315.606" offset="17365765">I merely have a couple of observations to make, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.156" offset="17395963">There are two anomalies as I see it, here in the situation as supported or contended for by Mr. Moore and, in the position we find ourselves in, in the light of the decisions of the two courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.482" offset="17469315">The first one, of course, is the one that Mr. Justice White just had reference to, that when one buys something that's covered by a patent and he acquires it by way of outright sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.605" offset="17513827">There is no longer a tether between the patentee and the item which now belongs, 100% in all of its aspects, to the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.203" offset="17556146">He, therefore, is entitled to derive as much use out of that as it is possible to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.886" offset="17582895">The second anomaly is this, that in holding that it was -- would not have been infringement for us to have replaced the six units with units precisely the same in size as the original ones but, on the other hand, it was infringement for us to resize those six units or relocate them, that patent monopoly was conferred on an aggregation of those six elements but only when they're used not in conjunction with the 1-pound can.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.368" offset="17752795">On the Cotton-Tie case, there again, I think the court in Aro observed, and properly so, that it was the strap that was patented and not the combination of the strap and the belt, and I think that pretty well covers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.025" offset="17811519">I thank the Court.</text>
