            <text syncTime="52.136" offset="311881">Mr. Krotinger.</text>

            <label>Mr. Myron N. Krotinger</label>
            <text syncTime="54.036" offset="319509">If the Court please?</text>
            <text syncTime="58.461" offset="337168">This case arises out of the declaration of unconstitutionality by the Ohio Supreme Court of the nonsigner clause of the 1936 Ohio Fair Trade Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.197" offset="408116">In January of 1958, the Supreme Court of the United -- rather, of the State of Ohio, in the Bargain Fair case, declared the nonsigner clause as null and void on the ground that it was a deprivation of due process of law, it was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority, it was unrelated to the police power of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.408" offset="520965">The Court, however, left unprepared the doctrine that a contract, a resale price maintenance contract, directly between a manufacturer or other authorized person and a vendor, would continue to be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.564" offset="601631">Hudson established its business in the City of Cleveland, downtown Cleveland in the summer of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.188" offset="632142">Hudson is on the business of buying and selling trademark and other commodities at a price which renders it a profit, however, below the fair traded prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.952" offset="691179">Hudson acquires all of its merchandise from a wholesaler in the State of Michigan, on the other side of Lake Erie, so that, for example, Upjohn products would first be bought by the wholesaler, then resold to Hudson, then resold to the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.942" offset="775189">In the summer of 1959, the State of Ohio passed a new fair trade law, June 29th, 1959, to take effect on October 22nd, 1959 and on July 31st, 1959, Hudson got a letter from Upjohn calling attention to the new law and stating that Upjohn was in light of its passage, calling attention of contracts that had been made under it and Hudson came to our firm and asked what was the situation and so we checked this new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.007" offset="947388">In this new statute, Your Honors, defines a contract as a contract arising either by agreement or by the act of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.208" offset="1012172">And the act of the parties which brings this contract into effect is the acquisition of a trademarked item with notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.013" offset="1063476">Well, if the Court please, the -- we've never seen anything quite like that in any other fair trade law.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.982" offset="1091271">We subsequently found something like it in the Virginia statute but prior to that time, there was nothing like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.654" offset="1121991">And then we looked at that statute a little further and we found it did other odd things.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.363" offset="1148844">It, for example, provided that a proprietor might also fair trade at the wholesale level, although it competed with its wholesalers, provided that the proprietor did not sell at a price different or other than the wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.886" offset="1246960">We also found that there are various provisions that a buyer could be required to sell only to persons with whom it made a resale price agreement and demand to the buyer that it too get a comparable contract from its sub-vendee.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.375" offset="1324910">We found another provision that the seller could agree to bind itself on making a sale to -- that it would demand of the next buyer that it, too, observed the resale price maintenance agreement and make a contract of a sub-vendee.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.718" offset="1402232">We also found a provision for the first time in any State fair trade law that it was a full defense to the action, that on the removal of a trademark, this would be a defense to the resale price maintenance contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.132" offset="1459911">Is the full scope of this statute been authoritatively construed by the Ohio courts?</text>

            <label>Mr. Myron N. Krotinger</label>
            <text syncTime="346.028" offset="1487496">Mr. Justice Harlan, we raised these constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.546" offset="1509543">The questions must have been passed upon in accordance with the Ohio statute which requires the appellate courts to pass upon all questions raised either by assignments of their -- or by brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.718" offset="1574222">What -- what the Supreme Court of Ohio did was to apply the premise in a minority -- in a minority ruling, in a 3-to-4 ruling --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="389.816" stopTime="391.078">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="389.816" offset="1662621">I beg your pardon, excuse me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="myron_n_krotinger" startTime="391.078" stopTime="1125.899">
            <label>Mr. Myron N. Krotinger</label>
            <text syncTime="391.078" offset="1667636">Sorry, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.863" offset="1678817">What the Supreme Court of Ohio did in its minority ruling, a 3-to-4 decision, was to apply the premise that such a statute achieved validity and authenticity solely as a matter of state law that the -- the Court also noted the completely novel nature of the statute, that for the first time, the conception of proprietary interest was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.283" offset="1800547">In other words, that a trademark holder or trade name owner must, as the statute says, retain a proprietary interest in his product and that upon giving notice, a contract eventually, the doctrine of implied contract, therefore, once the Supreme Court of Ohio started with the premise that this was wholly a matter of state law, it must necessarily, by the statute of Ohio, have overruled our contentions and I respectfully submit, Your Honor, that the judgment which was put on the books by the minority of the Court could not have been arrived at unless the very clear arguments as to conflict with the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution have been overruled by the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.303" offset="2028544">So, not to leave your question, Your Honor, as to whether there had been a construction, my answer is that there was an overruling of the contentions that we've made concerning the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.006" offset="2087372">So, Your Honor, then we looked a little further and we found that the only comparable statute, length and breadth that we could find was the Harris Bill, the first Harris Bill of 1958 which had been proposed in the Congress of the United States and where the Ohio statute followed most of the provisions of the Harris Act in the conception of proprietary interest, in the conception of notice, in the conception of the abnegation of the McKesson &amp; Robbins Doctrine, in the conception that a good merchandizing practice at all levels of commerce required the overruling of Section 5 (a) (5) of the McGuire Act and in the conception that a cooperative enforcement to avoid intra-brand competition was most desirable because I think that some of the literature has shown that following the decision of this Court in McKesson &amp; Robbins in 1956, wholesalers were discounting goods in commerce, particularly to change which thereby achieved a competitive advantage over the individual retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.130" offset="2387884">And so, with these propositions, we advised the client that we should obtain a declaratory judgment action in accordance with a time-honored practice that in a situation of this kind where injunctions might be obtained pursuant to the words of the statute, the client might well be put out of business before it constitutionality could be determined, this action was so filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.292" offset="2488508">The action specified both state grounds of unconstitutionality, federal grounds of unconstitutionality and Your Honors, in the Spring in 1958, on the second amended petition, followed by an answer in cross-petition by Upjohn in which enforcement was sought and where the Upjohn answer admitted and the policy and the practice of establishing and enforcing fair trade, the matter came on by motion for immediate trial into a courtroom with Upjohn having filed a motion for summary judgment, accompanied by 18 affidavits and Judge McNeil in that courtroom said, “Now, gentlemen, we have had one declaration of unconstitutionality by Judge Gusweiler in Cincinnati, we've had the Bargain Fair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.799" offset="2706578">My suggestion is that you'll sever this litigation so that you determine constitutionality on the petition and the responsive pleadings and leave the cross-petition for one side" and, may it please the Court, we also have another peculiar quirk in Ohio practice whereby we have no mandatory counterclaim procedure whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.780" offset="2802500">There is nothing like Federal Rule 13 of the FRCP.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.155" offset="2827995">In fact, the Ohio statute say that at any time prior to trial, a defendant may move to either discontinue his cross-petition or cross-claim when there is no difference under the Ohio practice, he may, thereby, achieve a separate docketing if the trial court so directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.842" offset="2922768">He may, upon direction of the trial court, thereby avoid special supplementary service or he may even start the case later on as a separate proceeding altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.849" offset="2978774">Perhaps, a very old-fashioned sort of practice rule, but one firmly embedded in the practice of the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.714" offset="3018271">And so, Your Honors, the parties in this proceeding proceeded accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.703" offset="3042200">We did just that and we proceeded to go to trial upon a stipulation of evidence, and this stipulation of evidence included affidavits filed by the appellant, a deposition filed by the local manager of Upjohn, counter-affidavits as to whether or not the Upjohn method of wholesaling disclosed actual competition between the wholesalers and Upjohn and in fact, Your Honors, the evidence disclosed the del credere agency pursuant to which many wholesalers in the State of Ohio and Northern Ohio did actually go after the business of retailers with whom Upjohn sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.779" offset="3222444">And we took the position back in 1958 and continuously down to the present time that within the teaching of Masonite and the more recent pronouncements of this Honorable Court, the del credere agency clearly can establish a competitive relationship between a manufacturer and an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.058" offset="3315649">Now, within the clear intent of the parties, Your Honors, every constitutional issue was thrown wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.246" offset="3344384">Therefore, the briefs -- the briefs in -- from the Court of Common Pleas on raised the issue of whether, within the meaning of 5 (a) (2) of the McGuire Act, this kind of contract could be a “contract or agreement” within the sense which the history of the McGuire Act taught us, in other words, that 0it had to be in the nature of something consensual, something consensual.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.328" offset="3456711">As this Court held in Schwegmann, contracts and agreements follow a congressional intendment, not to be decided by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.688" offset="3498088">We checked very carefully the history of that statute and we found that there isn't a word in the legislative history whereby the term "contract and agreement" might be given a different meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.674" offset="3550020">In fact, in the section-by-section analysis of the statute, Section 5 (a) (2) is described as referring solely to contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.629" offset="3593906">The amendment of 5 (a) (2) describes a permissible vertical contract manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer, they're not in so many words, but whereby the fair trade contract might require the contractee to enter into another contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.174" offset="3672064">The section-by-section analysis further made perfectly plain and clear that the reversal of Schwegmann by the Congress took place in terms of Section 5 (a) (3), dealing with nonsigner clauses, nonsigners.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.115" offset="3747819">In other words, that where a policy of the State provided that a remedy of unfair competition might be given equally against both signers and nonsigners who are not parties to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.480" offset="3801318">Such policy might be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.627" offset="3813857">Well, now, in the State of Ohio, we no longer have signers and nonsigners.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.753" offset="3830366">Signers and -- we didn't have those at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.675" offset="3842069">We only had contractors and we wondered about that, and so we got the reading about the Harris Bill and we found that as the State Supreme Courts continued to knock out the nonsigner clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.777" offset="3894523">On the suggestion of Professor MacLachlan in the December 1957 Vanderbilt Law Review on a new method of fair trade, Representative Harris had introduced this bill whereby a mechanism would be established, whereby, upon giving notice of a proprietary interest, everyone would now be bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.696" offset="3974144">There wouldn't be -- there just wouldn't be anymore nonsigner problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.020" offset="3991489">And this proprietary interest, by shifting the basis of fair trading throughout the United States would create a method, the rationale and a new basis of interstate commerce for being better able to have an orderly marketing of goods within the fair trade laws free of rulings like Vessel, like the -- like the Master of Discount House of Washington D.C. cases which held that goods might be shipped from a nonsigner state into -- rather, into an non fair trade area into a fair trade area, but if the contract were closed outside the fair trade area, then the discounting by means of catalogue shipments was perfectly good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.021" offset="4183437">It would also give a rationale basis for overcoming the ruling of this Court in McKesson &amp; Robbins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.631" offset="4205902">It would also give a basis for the cooperative enforcement of fair trade where, if this Court please, any cooperative enforcement of price maintenance in commerce would be suspect and interdicted as a boycott, none of which the McGuire Act permits, but which was sought by the proponents of fair trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.742" offset="4302346">All this was in the Ohio statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.230" offset="4312273">This was argued, Your Honors, in the Court of Common Pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.873" offset="4322826">These issues were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.463" offset="4329200">These issues were carried up to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.867" offset="4342888">The judge in the Court of Common Pleas agreed with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.861" offset="4354800">He thought there was an unlawful delegation of the Ohio Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.000" offset="4371414">The Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.173" offset="4388028">And in its extended ruling, specifically mentioned that there were no federal issues with which it found difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.795" offset="4434526">Then, we went to the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio and I might add, Your Honors, that we filed a -- an application for rehearing with the Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County in which we raised federal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.714" offset="4490219">And the Upjohn brief, a certified copy of which has been filed with this Court, in opposition to our petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County on the ground, perhaps, that Court had really now encompassed the federal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.563" offset="4549674">We were told by Upjohn that our position was ludicrous and in fact, the Court of Appeals had considered such issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.130" offset="4583842">Then, we filed our motion to certify to the Supreme Court of Ohio on the grounds of great and general public interest --</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.802" offset="5534595">“Apparently, from your House Bill 318, you have attempted to get around the provision or to write in the law a corrective feature whereby notice to anyone by mail or otherwise or perhaps markings on the package would be sufficient to bind a nonsigner and the very acceptance of his product for sale by him would be deemed to be a contract with the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.470" offset="5625292">Am I correct on that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.655" offset="5677955">” Mr. Sweeny: “And one further thought arising from my ignorance, under what theory of law would you bind the third party to a contract where he had no communication whatsoever with the manufacturer?</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.652" offset="5805955">" The Court has said that is a pretty adequate, the doctrine has refused to apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.147" offset="5823927">I think the same thing would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.406" offset="5836988">This Court knows the implied warranty theory is a theory of tort recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.062" offset="5871574">It's tort recovery, a means of facilitating recovery by an injured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.971" offset="5895293">In fact, Mr. Gorrell also recognized that if this weren't recognized in contract theory, there would be a constitutional amendment required in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.806" offset="5946598">And at page 269 of legislative record, and Mr. Robinson, one of the sponsors, said to Mr. Gorrell, “If the Supreme Court would deny fair trade, as you set it forth here, you have the feeling or is it your opinion, we're dealing with opinions this afternoon, in your opinion, there is only one other answer and that would be to have a fair trade amendment of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.615" offset="6473853">In presenting this case on behalf of the appellee, Upjohn Company, I beg to call the Court's attention to the parallel and, yet, slightly different position of these two appellees in 489 and 490 where Mr. Krotinger will argue for appellant in each and Mr. Willis will follow me in speaking for the appellee, Lilly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.456" offset="6601226">These cases are essentially similar and yet, there are differences in details which may be important on the two appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.450" offset="6781158">At page 380 of the large brown record in the Upjohn case, we have the statement of the Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.013" offset="6827447">In the two cases, Lilly and Upjohn, in the fifth line of Justice Skeel's opinion, both cases involved some of the facts and with the questions to be determined by this Court the same in each case, the appeals will be considered together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.237" offset="6896306">The assignment of error is identical in both cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.169" offset="6916054">You've heard Mr. Krotinger paint at large the numerous constitutional points he raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.579" offset="6937684">The quotation by the Ohio court is “For its assignment of error, defendant-appellant asserts that the Court of Common Pleas, the trial court, of Cuyahoga County erred in declaring, I interpolate the statute, to be in violation of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.256" offset="7024410">Now, I, therefore, deem it our duty as appellees to present to Your Honors the facts of the record bearing on the settled doctrine of this Court, that the Court will not act under Section -- of the section of the code where the judgment of the state court to be reviewed lacks the requisite finality and that this Court has jurisdiction or takes jurisdiction only of federal questions passed on by the highest court of the State being reviewed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.006" offset="7683427">He says that's been construed in our favor against him by the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.831" offset="7710699">It's not to be found in the language but that's an inferential construction, as they are told.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.512" offset="7733373">Nothing else, I think, comes out of the Ohio Supreme Court except the final determination as to the Ohio Constitution and its impact on this new statute of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.529" offset="7781439">Your Honors will appreciate how that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.142" offset="7791992">If you gather from Mr. Krotinger's history that in Ohio, the prior nonsigner statute and the Bargain Fair case so-called of the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court, declaring the prior statute unconstitutional as an undue delegation of legislative power, how those preempted the entire foreground of the -- of the litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.366" offset="7956877">Now, since that part is raised by the question, may I at once go to that and refer Your Honors to the place in this comprehensive record where the Supreme Court dealt with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.952" offset="8003166">It's at page 413, and I skip any further references to the prior decisions below.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.052" offset="8231581">He quotes the definition of contract in the new Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.409" offset="8245060">Then, he says, at page 417, "This provision is the core of the Act, the definition of contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.171" offset="13024005">And the reason they do show, they're showing it elsewhere in their briefs because in Ohio, they were confronted with this Court's decision in the Old Dearborn case that upheld the enforcement of a state non -- nonsigner law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.432" offset="13269138">And it construes the Ohio statute, we say, authoritatively in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.846" offset="13610715">None of the plans raised by the applicant for reconsideration in the instant case are moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.910" offset="13630986">All were treated far more extensively in the original briefs submitted to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.274" offset="13652511">All were argued orally by counsel for the applicant at the hearing before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.572" offset="13673618">Applicant's first contention was at the Court, does not appear to have considered the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which applicant asserts, requires the observance by this Court of the McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.911" offset="13718967">Applicant's argument does not include a single authority not brought to the Court's attention initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.752" offset="13746343">Starting on page 1 and continuing on page 22 of applicant's initial answer brief in the Upjohn Company case, counsel for the applicant opened up the very same attack he is now asserting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.405" offset="13792946">More importantly, the majority, in its opinion, clearly considered the question raised by federal statutes, so that applicant's assertion that this Court missed the “impact of the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution” boarders on a ludicrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.721" offset="13858252">This Court in its majority opinion discussed the evolution of federal statutory law and the significant federal decisions regarding fair trade and paying state in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.111" offset="13903809">The Court properly concluded that the implied contract provision of the new Act did not offend constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.421" offset="13933066">I might add, I omitted one sentence in which the Court's attention was also pointed out, that in the initial answer brief in the Eli Lilly case in the Court of Appeals, 12 pages are devoted to development of the same point, namely, the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.332" offset="13992730">We then go to our brief in support of motion to certify where the broad gauge second issue is stated in accordance with sound Ohio practice to “Is the Ohio fair trade law inclusive violative of the Constitution of the United States or of any law of the United States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.470" offset="14093249">The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County answered, “No.”</text>
