            <text syncTime="28.023" offset="215437">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.725" offset="246262">This is a death action brought by a widow for the death of her husband who was killed on Grand Isle which is on the shoreline of the State of Louisiana, the action being brought under Article 2315 of our Civil Code which is our death action statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.766" offset="342392">It was brought in the federal court on the ground of diversity of citizenship as the widower is a citizen of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.859" offset="386800">A jury trial was held and the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.356" offset="424835">The facts of this case briefly stated, the deceased, (Inaudible) Mercer was an offshore worker, working out in the Gulf of Mexico and he lived in a trailer on Grand Isle and he go to and from his work out in the Gulf by boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.513" offset="517413">He came in, docked on Grand Isle -- that docked there on December the 18th, 1955 at approximately 7 o'clock of that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.338" offset="564746">As a rule, he would ride with coworkers who drop him off with his trailer where he lived with his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.503" offset="593377">But on this night, he decided to not ride with his coworkers and he would walk home, it's about four miles to the East.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.400" offset="632978">There's only one road on Grand Isle being Highway 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.024" offset="651473">He was found on the right hand side of the road on the shoulder of the road the next morning, 6:00 or 6:30 am, faced down some two or three feet from the asphalt portion of the highway on the shoulder of the road, dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.212" offset="728168">There were tire marks showing that on the shoulder of the road, at and near his body, a -- a pool of blood in the tire mark on the shoulder of the road and he was severely injured, his legs were broken, liver, spleen ruptured, spine chord injury, skull fracture, brain damage resulting in his death as shown by the coroner's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.565" offset="861602">There were no eyewitnesses to this accident that caused his death.He wore a -- a denim overalls of blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.984" offset="923355">The -- when he -- when his body was found, the investigative officers were notified and they came to the scene and made some pictures of the body there on the shoulder of the road which pictures are introduced into evidence and are before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.784" offset="1006529">The officers also made an -- an investigation and determined that there was a man that had been on the island as they would call it down there, in a bar, a fisherman's bar wharf and drinking scotch and water all afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.135" offset="1083956">This man was Paris Theriot and he owned an automobile agency and he came down there to sell, the owner of the business there, an automobile which he did consummate the sale that afternoon, drinking scotch and whiskey during the course of the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.066" offset="1163682">And he left the bar at about 7:30 of that night, 7 pm.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.547" offset="1201612">It was foggy and rainy, drizzly evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.442" offset="1225122">Immediately, the officers -- he became the suspect and the officers went to his -- where he lived, he got a home on Grand Isle as well as in Golden Meadow, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.341" offset="1276740">And they went up to Golden Meadow and found him and asked him if he'd been on the island and he first denied that he hadn't -- hadn't been there at all but then he later admitted that he had been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.409" offset="1325014">And they asked him where his car was and he pointed out to it across the bar there.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.211" offset="1352182">And the officers got the car and made some pictures of it in an investigation, examination of the automobile and found that the right rim of the headlight was missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.733" offset="1402337">That the front fender was dented on the front and that there was a dent on the hood of the automobile, about near the windshield and that in this denture -- indentations on the automobile, there was a blue coloring.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.941" offset="1475166">And so the officers took scrapings of this coloring which was fabric-like and matched according to the testimony of the officials, the -- the denim overalls that this deceased was wearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.465" offset="1533262">Mr. Theriot was then asked if he had washed his car and he denied that he had, although he --- he said that it always been washed every morning but this morning, it hadn't been washed.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.136" offset="1583940">Yet the officers found some powdery -- powdery substance, one of them described, it looked like Old Dutch Cleanser on the automobile indicating that it had been washed.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.775" offset="1630438">The officers also found a towel -- stuff behind the seat cover behind the back -- the front seat up between the seat and the seat cover of a brown substance which appeared like blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.136" offset="1683937">They put the car on a rack and found underneath the car some hairy substance and -- and blood under the steering mechanism, underneath the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.859" offset="1722807">Putting all of those bits of evidence and envelops for marking, they took it to the courthouse of Jefferson Parish for it to be taken to the laboratory for testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.522" offset="1789471">All of these evidence disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.417" offset="1801070">The only thing that remained was these photographs that were made by the investigating officers showing the deceased and the car itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.746" offset="1866376">Faced with this evidence as to the damage to his automobile, confronted with that, he was asked by these officers."</text>
            <text syncTime="451.427" offset="1909112">Well, how did that happen?"</text>
            <text syncTime="456.722" offset="1930219">His answer to them was, "Well, I hit a cow."</text>
            <text syncTime="461.360" offset="1948818">And then they kept pressing him about that and then he changed the story and said, "No, I ran into a truck before I went down to Grand Isle, I was going along the road and ran into rear of a stake body truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.112" offset="2003780">And I damaged my car that way and a piece of wood fell out of the truck and hit my car and I ran off the road but I came back on the road."</text>
            <text syncTime="485.937" offset="2047143">So the officers took him out there to the scene where he said he had this wreck before he went to Grand Isle and asked him to point out where it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.980" offset="2087267">And the officers testified that if he had -- there's no marking there at all of showing a car going off the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.024" offset="2115480">He -- he estimated 100 -- a 150 feet, he went off the road but there's no tire marks at all showing that the car had -- any card had gone of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.105" offset="2151842">And had there been a car that -- going off the road at that point, it was so soggy and mud -- muddy that the car couldn't have gotten out itself and it would have been pulled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.506" offset="2193429">But yet, he stuck to that story.</text>
