            <text syncTime="17.501" offset="173328">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.441" offset="197151">As I was pointing out yesterday, we have involved here two touchable transactions, I say, involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.055" offset="239574">We only have one involved and that is the estate tax on the estate of Lowell Stapf.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.523" offset="273429">The other taxable event or transaction that will give rise to taxes would be the gift by Mrs. Stapf to the trustees of a portion of -- for community property as a result of her election.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.521" offset="353468">That would be subject to such gift taxes as -- or imposed by the gift tax statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.245" offset="384397">So -- but that is not what we are here concerned with, it's not involved in this case and it's not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.619" offset="421804">We have only the issue of the estate taxes in the estate of Lowell Stapf.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.019" offset="455450">Now, of course, prior to 1942 and since 1948, the community property States, only the one-half share of the community property of a decedent is included in his estate for estate tax purposes, that is the -- the share and part of the community property of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.878" offset="582928">Of course, during the period from 1942 to 1948, the entire community property, both halves, was subject to a federal -- estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.954" offset="631202">Now, in 1948, the marital deduction provision was adopted to the remedy and the situation that existed and put all estates on a parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.990" offset="699329">In that, there would be only one-half of the property tax either in a community property State or in a non-community property State to the extent that the property passed from the deceased spouse to the surviving spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.860" offset="790862">Now -- and that was put in by putting in the marital deduction.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. M. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="183.184" offset="836106">It is deductible, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.694" offset="842167">In determining the estate tax, it is deducted just like administration expenses or funeral expenses or debts and claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.337" offset="884694">It is deducted to the extent of one-half of the adjusted gross estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.237" offset="920325">Now, the adjusted gross estate, to determine that, you take the total estate both halves in the community, deduct from it all community property, makes other adjustments for administration expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.035" offset="999528">And the substance of -- roughly, what you come out with, the adjusted gross estate is that -- is -- in a community property State, only the property that is a separate property of the spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.774" offset="1082493">Now, in a non-community property State, you do not have that -- you do not have that limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.937" offset="1123140">It's amounts to the same thing because it's one-half of the gross estate, adjusted gross estate that is the limit of the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.518" offset="1181445">Now, that was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.480" offset="1213315">The marital deduction was passed in 1948 to equalize the community property States and the non-community property States by allowing this deduction of one-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.766" offset="1290428">The -- what we're concerned here with today is the value of the property that passed from Mr. Stapf to Mrs. Stapf.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.662" offset="1358033">For a property to qualify for the marital deduction, there are several things that must occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.676" offset="1394082">First, the property -- the -- or value which is to be deducted and qualified for the marital deduction, it must be included in the estate of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.073" offset="1443715">That's the first requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.201" offset="1452178">The second requirement is that the property must pass from the decedent to his surviving spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.994" offset="1491362">Of course, there are other limitations such as the terminable requirement but we're not concerned with that because the property that passed to Mrs. Stapf, passed to her absolutely -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.258" offset="1564400">In Mr. Stapf's estate, he owned real property in the City of Amarillo, value that $65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.638" offset="1609958">He also owns some hand properties described in the will, his hand tools, value at $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.444" offset="1653112">He owned one-half interest in community property of a total value of $258,000 that is, both halves of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.274" offset="1708492">Now, the hand tools passed out of the picture because they were -- it was subject of a special request.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.469" offset="1745272">Then he left to Mrs. Stapf one-third of the gross estate, both separate property and community property and put her to an election to take under the will or not to take under the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.466" offset="1813191">So, one-third interest in this real property valued at $65,000 passed to Mrs. Stapf under the will, that's the separate property.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.116" offset="1867839">Additionally, she took or retained a one-third interest in the total community estate, both halves.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.309" offset="1924577">Now, there is no question about the separate property being included in Mr. Stapf's estate and being subject to estate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.355" offset="1976822">There is no question but what the one-third interest in this separate property passed to Mrs. Stapf.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.682" offset="2018095">It passed to her absolutely, so you'll have the first two requirements under the gift tax -- under the marital deduction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.745" offset="2062399">Then you come to a question of determining how much is to be deducted in determining the estate that is subject to estate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.695" offset="2130108">Now, we submit that the full $22,000 or one-third of the $65,000 is deductible under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.777" offset="2210461">It's by virtue of a regulation of the Commissioner that it is claimed that the property so passing to Mrs. Stapf cannot be valued at its full value for the purpose of the deduction.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="559.818" offset="2342640">I repeat my question.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.221" offset="2348283">You concede that the regulation, that the words of the regulation cover the facts of this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_m_sutton" startTime="566.435" stopTime="1006.409">
            <label>Mr. W. M. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="566.435" offset="2369076">Yes, it -- it's designed and directed at the -- at this.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.991" offset="2395303">The -- of course, the trial court and the Court of Appeals both held the regulation to be invalid and an extension beyond the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.818" offset="2442637">Now, turning -- turning to the -- the statute itself, 812 (e) (1) (E) (ii) is the part of the statute that refers to the valuation of the property that passes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.343" offset="2580773">It says, "Where -- where an interest or a property is incumbered or any manner -- in any manner or whether the surviving spouse incurs an obligation imposed by the decedent with the respect to the passing of such interest, such incumbrance or obligation shall be taken into the account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to such spouse of such interest were being determined."</text>
            <text syncTime="650.463" offset="2705220">Now, we have here a question of determining the amount that is passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.245" offset="2736358">Mr. Barnett puts emphasis on the words to such spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.904" offset="2759032">But that is not the subject matter of the section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.401" offset="2784946">It is the amount that presses.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.420" offset="2801037">Now, the regulation has a specific provision in it that deals with a community property estate that is section -- Regulation 81.47c.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.709" offset="2894242">After referring to an interest that is subject to a mortgage or other incumbrance, they say the passing of a property interest subject to the imposition of an obligation by the decedent does not include a bequest, devise, or transfer in lieu of bower, curtesy, or other statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy or other marital rights in the decedent property or estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.447" offset="3009181">Then, specifically directed out of community property State, the regulation says, "The passing of a property interest subject to the imposition of an obligation by the decedent does not include a bequest in lieu of the interest of his surviving spouse under the community property laws unless such interest was immediately deprived of the decedent's death a mere expectancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.140" offset="3159960">Now, that is -- that regulation is directed particularly toward community property States.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.564" offset="3201651">Under its language, it would apply, as far as the language is concern, only in a community property State.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.370" offset="3232893">In answer to the question that was asked yesterday as to whether or not this problem could rise in a non-community property State, I'll say that it cannot arise except where the surviving spouse has property of her own over which she has control except for the property of her own and can dispose of it by will gift for the other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.149" offset="3343966">As in other words, that's -- it would be something that would occur in other States but only where the wife has property of her own is subject to her control.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.024" offset="3395480">Now, the question here is the amount of the property that passes and it is to be determined as if a gift was being made -- being valued for gift purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.903" offset="3474996">Now, the Commissioner takes the position that what Mrs. Stapf gave to her children should be offset against what she received in determining the benefit from her.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.085" offset="3563708">Now, there are two things wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.699" offset="3582203">In the first place, if that is allowed to zero out the value of the property that passed under the estate tax, you're going to be subjecting that property to two estate taxes, one, when Mr. Stapf died and the other, when Mrs. Stapf dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.650" offset="3689932">That is contrary to the expressed purpose and intent of the adoption of the marital deduction provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.633" offset="3729951">So, if -- if the Government's position is maintained, you'll be taxing this property, this separate property of Mr. Stapf.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.788" offset="3782510">You'll be taxing it for estate tax purposes twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.227" offset="3796302">Once in Mr. Stapf's estate and again, when Mrs. Stapf dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.480" offset="3821275">There is one other fault and trouble with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.094" offset="3855757">Actually, what she would be -- what the Government is saying should be done is that a tax should be levied upon what Mrs. Stapf gives to her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.590" offset="3913749">Now, if that is subject to any tax at all, and we don't deny that it is that it's a gift and it's subject to such gift taxes as are applicable to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.162" offset="3960038">Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.319" offset="3968606">If it is a taxable gift, it is taxable at gift tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.869" offset="3994833">Yet, if you take that value and put it over in the estate, you're going to be taxing that gift, not at gift tax rates but at estate tax rates and subjecting it not to a gift tax but subjecting it to estate tax in Mr. Stapf's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.960" offset="4083231">Contrary, we submit to the clear intent purpose and language of the marital deduction provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.137" offset="4431914">Now, of course, there is a provision in the gift tax statute that authorizes if it's purchased for a bona fide consideration, it's taxed only to the extent of the above the amount for which it has given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.334" offset="4512684">Now, this Court decided some years ago in the Wemyss case, I take it that's the way you pronounce it, W-E-M-Y-S-S, that a -- in valuing a gift from a donor to another person, that only a consideration moving back to the donor and measured in money or money's worth, was to be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.607" offset="4669837">In that instance, in that instance, the donor gave to his intended bride certain stocks in consideration of her agreement to marry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.561" offset="4753638">As a result of her marriage, she gave up a beneficial interest in a trust that had been created for her by her former husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.637" offset="4813928">So, when they got ready to determine the value of the gift from the husband to his intended bride, it was the taxpayer's contention that what she gave up should be offset against what she received to determine the value of the gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.172" offset="4900028">But this Court held that that was not the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.368" offset="4916851">That it had to be a consideration passing to the donor and measured in money or money's worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.080" offset="4955721">And therefore, the value of the stock that passed from the donor to his intended bride was to be valued at its full market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.967" offset="4995218">Now, the Court held that the mere deposition to the donee didn't satisfy the requirements of the gift statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.394" offset="5036910">Now, that is the statute obviously that Congress is referring to in the adoption of the marital deduction provision and the provision where it says that it shall be determined as if a gift was and if an amount of the gift was being determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.486" offset="5109321">That was the basis of the holding of the trial court and that was the basis to the holding of the Court of Civil Appeals in this case relying upon the Wemyss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.796" offset="5166582">Now, we have that kind of situation here because when Mrs. Stapf elected to take under the will and therefore, surrendered a part of her property to the trustees for the benefit of her children, there was nothing that passed from her back to the donor or -- or the testator in this case, Mr. Stapf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.294" offset="5312554">It was a benefit that passed from her to a third party and not a consideration that moved from her back to the donor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.561" offset="5357589">So, the Wemyss case would certainly require the valuation of the interest that passed from Mr. Stapf to Mrs. Stapf under the will at its full market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.591" offset="5433762">That's the only question we have is how to value this property of the passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.980" offset="5455287">There's no question about what it passed and qualifies in every other respect for the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.849" offset="5482768">Now, when Mrs. Stapf elected to take under the will, her half of the community property did not go back to or become a part of the estate of Mr. Stapf or subject to estate taxes in his estate for gift tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.864" offset="5566777">There is a GCM ruling on that that has been in effect for many years that where a widow is put to an election, her property, her half of the community does not become a part of the community of the decedent for estate tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.629" offset="5653922">So, that property passed to -- passed to third parties and it's not included into the estate -- estate tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.413" offset="5713063">Now, the Government takes the position that the election was an obligation, I mean the provision in the will requiring Mrs. Stapf to exercise an election, was an obligation imposed upon by the decedent with respect to the passing of this interest under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.822" offset="5834689">We submit that the word "obligation", as there used, refers to an obligation in the nature of a -- in the incumbrance or a charge upon the specific property that passes under the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.883" offset="5918908">We think that the Senate Report and the House Report explaining this provision makes that clear that it is an obligation or a charge that is on the property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.822" offset="6014621">And since this is not a charge upon this particular property, it is not an obligation within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.932" offset="6083062">We think that the Senate Report upon -- upon that point makes it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.002" offset="6123395">And the trial court concurred with us in that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.792" offset="6150562">The Court of Appeals didn't reach the question on whether or not the obligation was in -- in the nature of a charge upon the specific property, because the Court of Appeals concluded that under the direction in the statute that the amount of the gift be determined as if a -- I mean amount of the property passing, qualifying for the marital deduction, would be determined as if a gift were being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.787" offset="6326523">And that therefore, they did not find it necessary to reach and decide the question of the obligation because they thought the question was concluded and decided by the Wemyss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.363" offset="6424848">The Wemyss case has been followed and report that we're contending for here, is illustrated in some tax court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.013" offset="6495378">The Bartman case, it has a situation parallel to what we have involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.452" offset="6533204">Now, in the petition for writ of certiorari and in the brief, counsel for the petitioner puts emphasis upon what he says would be a loss of revenue if the opinion of the Court's -- Circuit Court of Appeals is followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.797" offset="6678549">The Circuit Court recognized that under the decision in Segal versus Commissioner by one of the Circuit Court of Appeals that in valuing the gift for gift tax purposes that passed from Mrs. Stapf to the children that she was entitled to deduct the amount that she gave up being her one-sixth part of the community estate or the difference between one-third and one-half which she would've had, had she elected to take against the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.522" offset="6893484">If that be true and the Segal case had been followed in a number of several other cases by the tax court, even if that be true, that is no reason for imposing an estate tax where the statute does not impose estate tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.449" offset="7929187">Now, under such a statute, you are not going to get uniformity in deductions because the deductions are determined by the state laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2627.445" offset="10613112">Now, the point here is upon the -- the marital -- on these debts and claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.266" offset="10732440">The Court of Appeals did not hope that all debts should be deducted from estate by a virtue of the provision in the will, I mean, it should be deducted in the determining estate taxes by a virtue of provision in the will, for the reason that the statute, authorizing these deductions, says, with respect to claim, that it maybe deducted only with respect to the -- the -- where there is a consideration in money or money's worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.821" offset="10934627">Now, the debts and claims in this instance are in the main if not totally debts that arose by operation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.824" offset="10998680">Now, a claim to be deducted has to be a claim that is based upon a -- and based upon a promise, can be deducted only to the extent that the consideration was received in adequate consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.470" offset="11085302">Therefore, where you have a community debt, you would only deduct one-half of it under this statute even under our position as -- and under the holding of the Court of Appeals because a community debt is chargeable to equal -- to each half of the community and so you would only include one-half of the community property or interest in that estate of the decedent that first died and so you would only deduct and charge -- I mean, you would deduct only one-half of the -- of the debts that are founded upon a promise and consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.834" offset="11326673">The -- that fact alone will prevent there being the opportunity for a person as to -- to manipulate the debts and liabilities to where it would zero out property or as far as estate tax purpose is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.654" offset="11449971">That was a matter of concern to Judge Wisdom in his dissenting opinion that illustrates -- it was used in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.882" offset="11506918">But when you read the Circuit Court's opinion in light of the consideration required, the situation or illustration given where a person owned a million dollars and went out and bargain another million dollars and then took the $200,000 or two million dollars and bought two million dollars worth of stock and then the husband assumed all of the indebtedness and this property supposed to -- to pass tax free, it doesn't -- it doesn't work out that way, the mathematics doesn't work out that way because only one-half of that debt would be deductible in the husband's estate, so you would have -- you have half a million dollars -- they originally had a million dollars from "inde" and they bought another million dollar worth of stock, wait a minute, they had bought two million dollars worth of stock, so there'd be a million dollars under this example that would subject to tax in the estate and you would have a deduction of only half of the indebtedness or $500,000 and so, there is not the chance of tax avoidance that is feared in the deduction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.541" offset="11901576">Now, in conclusion, let me say on the marital deduction that we have only the amount of the property that passes, the only question of valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.532" offset="12005543">Government counsel says that that just got a zero value simply because she gave away the property.</text>
