            <label>Mr. W. McLean Pitts</label>
            <text syncTime="57.860" offset="335788">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.450" offset="358149">It is with great humility that I appear before this Court in view of some of the propositions that we are going to make to this Court in behalf of the appellants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.155" offset="421052">I will briefly go through some of the -- the points that lead up to the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.849" offset="463788">We'll go in to historically a little of the Alabama history relative to its constitutional convention, the Acts of the legislature that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.187" offset="525124">On March the 26th, this Court gave the -- handed down the decision of Baker versus Carr which was somewhat a radical departure from the cases from 1803 to 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.847" offset="607775">Baker represents neither the familiar pattern of judicial review and occasional negation of particular governmental policies nor the newer pattern in some of the desegregation cases of impositions of -- it is to act or rather than to desist, but both of these patterns have this much in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.178" offset="717072">They leave essentially in fact the distribution and possession of political power by contrast.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.105" offset="748837">It is my position that Baker versus Carr is an invitation to the courts to sit in judgment of the structure of political power even to the effect of a judicial transfer of political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.614" offset="818845">Before the ink was drawn on Baker versus Carr decision and on April the 14th, 1962, the three-judge Federal District Court issued its ultimatum to the Alabama Legislature that it must reapportion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.005" offset="892406">On July the 12th, 1962, the Alabama Legislature produced two bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.498" offset="922394">One of them was the Sixty Seventh Amendment bill which was a constitutional amendment that was to be submitted to the people of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.768" offset="963459">Then they passed the Webb-Crawford Act which was a Savings Act that would have reapportioned the 1966 legislature provided that people of Alabama to hand down the Sixty Seventh Amendment Act as proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.327" offset="1049663">On July the 25th, 13 days after the passage of that -- of the Act, of these two Acts, the Federal Judge of the District Court declared both of these Acts unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.335" offset="1113715">And in their decision, they took the senatorial provisions of the way of Crawford Act and the House provisions of the Sixty Seventh Amendment Act put the two together and legislated for the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.674" offset="1211099">Now, my propositions to this Court are simply that the legislative reapportionment, there are four propositions I want to make to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.114" offset="1252895">One, legislative reapportionment should be resolved without federal interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.355" offset="1285810">The Court should reconsult Baker versus Carr or clarify Baker versus Carr and return to the original Constitution, proposition that courts do not interfere with the political structure of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.080" offset="1348712">Two, the courts should limit themselves under the time honored to constitutional provisions for checks and balances to the function of judicial review of Legislative Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.288" offset="1409526">They should not invade the providence of the legislature whether -- whether it is done by exacting new laws or whether it is done by a veto power.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.199" offset="1457173">Three, the Court should not have declared in that the proposed amendment to the Constitution of Alabama which by the Acts of a legislature -- by the Act of a legislature was to be submitted to the vote of the people of Alabama on a one man, one vote basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.835" offset="1543690">Four, even under Baker versus Carr, the District Court should not ever retain -- retained jurisdiction in this case because the factual situation in the case at bar is different from the facts in the Tennessee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.045" offset="1612549">Now, in order for you gentlemen to understand probably my argument, it is necessary for me to go back a little bit to the Constitutional Convention of 1901.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.028" offset="1668556">That convention brought together delegates in Montgomery, Alabama who have been recognized as the greatest minds of political thoughts and lawyers in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.290" offset="1741594">They came up and as -- as I heard the argument of the New York case yesterday, it brought me to mind in reading the proceedings of the 1901 Constitutional Convention of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.063" offset="1800631">That practically, every point that was made before this Court about the distribution of political power and districting was discussed in the 1901 Constitutional Convention of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.949" offset="1864161">That Constitution was submitted to the people on a one man, one vote basis and was adopted by the people.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.793" offset="1919540">I will -- come on down to that in just a little bit of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.084" offset="1932706">I'm getting to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.615" offset="1942841">In deciding to -- in -- in arriving at this, these men realized the great geographical distant differences that exist in the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.300" offset="2033643">Alabama is a state of great natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.652" offset="2033539">I'm not talking for the Chamber of Commerce, but I'm just pointing this out to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.042" offset="2052556">Across the center of the state around the Birmingham area, we have steel mills, coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.229" offset="2081290">You go into the North in the Tennessee Valley, you'd run into the great farming area, of course now you run into the hospitals which has greatly increased in population recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.747" offset="2119429">Then in the South it was not in this middle part of the state which is known as Blytheville which I am from, you'll run into a farm and in rural area then he should go on down to the Mobile, you run into the waterfronts, the coastal area and again an industrial section.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.938" offset="2192154">All of these were kept in mind, what I'm trying to point out to the Court in this 1901 Constitutional Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.866" offset="2227890">We of the Blytheville recognize that there was malapportionment in the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and I'm not standing before this Court in saying that there was not malapportionment before in the legislature in 1960, but we said per se that if the legislature of Alabama is to be reapportioned, then it should be reapportioned by the legislature of Alabama and not by a federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.650" offset="2419001">But, what I want to point out is -- the point that we want to make is that how we differ in the Tennessee case that although we waited from 1901 to 1962 when the District Court issued its ultimatum to the Alabama legislature, they acted promptly and they did pass a constitutional amendment to be submitted to the people of Alabama and even another Act known as the Webb-Crawford Act which is a Savings Act in Blytheville.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.856" offset="2643864">Yes sir, but I want to point out, it's my position in this was, getting back to the point of Baker versus Carr, which I believe, that under several Declaratory Act, I believe that the Court had jurisdiction to say that it was unconstitutional but I do not believe that the Court has the power to legislate for the people of Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.519" offset="2774476">Now, in passed -- in the Constitutional Convention of 1901, the legislature was set up so that that would be as House and a Senate, not more than 35 Senators and not more than 135 -- 105 members of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.140" offset="2884921">Then they proceeded that they -- to set up 35 senatorial districts and provided that each Senator was to have a district.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.004" offset="2928389">Then, there's another provision of Alabama Constitution that says that the Senate -- Senate shall not consist of less down one-fourth or more than one-third of the House of Representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.160" offset="3037059">No county shall be divided into two senatorial districts and no district shall be made up of two or more districts not contiguous to each other and those are the provisions in the Alabama Constitution that the legislature was confronted with every time it would start to reapportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.047" offset="3124621">There have been -- been many -- many others bills introduced, but those were the constitutional provisions of the 1901 Constitution and the point is that I'm trying to make this Court that it is not on a population basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.634" offset="3206959">The Solicitor General in his brief cites percentages and figures but actually, the Alabama Legislature is not based solely on a population basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.815" offset="9367677">The former Attorney General of Alabama was a party to this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.167" offset="9389098">As I understand, he was brought in because of some ministerial duty that he had in canvassing votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.948" offset="9420236">Naturally, he was brought in along with some other public officials in order for this suit to develop to -- for the action and alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.273" offset="9457539">The former Attorney General did not appeal this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.374" offset="9485855">Thus, I am here today as his successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.775" offset="9503514">I do not believe that there is a citizen or an official of Alabama that could argue under any shadow of fairness or justice that apportionment of the legislature of Alabama under the 1901 Constitution as it is here today or as when this suit started is anything but unfair, unjust and even approaches the ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.589" offset="9626708">On occasions, the Supreme Court of Alabama has even recognized this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.574" offset="9658681">Now, we come to the proposition that the lower court has taken jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.456" offset="9678221">Now, as stated in our brief, we argue under the presumption that Baker versus Carr will not be overturned in that event, or in case Baker versus Carr were overturned or were considered, we would want or expect or ask another day in Court, but we argue here today under the presumption that it will not be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.504" offset="9774456">If it pleases the Court, I have served a term in the State Senate of Alabama before -- naturally before I became Attorney General of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.103" offset="9828791">I represented and this maybe peculiar in that I represented a two-county district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.705" offset="9855227">My home county which was the most underrepresented county in the House of Representatives; the most -- Houston County, the most underrepresented county in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.024" offset="9912487">I also represented an adjoining county as its Senator, Henry County which is the second most overrepresented county in the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.476" offset="9966299">If you gentlemen will admit, that's a good job for one man to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.143" offset="9988974">Now, in my home county of some 50,000 people slightly over, we have one member of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.535" offset="10026486">We share the Senator with Henry County who had something over 13,000 people; they have two members of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.382" offset="10065878">Now, they were only surpassed by one other county, Lowndes County and being more overrepresented than they.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.609" offset="10102868">Lowndes has slightly over 13,000 people, they had two members of the House but they had a senator to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.336" offset="10141738">So as you can see, the apportionment under the 1901 Constitution at time they started approaches the absolute ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.915" offset="10188027">I argue not as to the validity or just how just or fair it was in 1901 because in 1901, my home county of Houston did not even exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.972" offset="10244242">We were born after the adoption of 1901 Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.100" offset="10280814">After the lower court took jurisdiction, then the legislature passed some acts that the three-judge District Court said were not acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.198" offset="10341209">So they then wrote a temporary measure as I understand they said it was as temporary measure that would serve until the legislature had passed a bill that was adequate. Now, the legislature has met and failed to act, I realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.696" offset="10403171">However, there are reasons for that action and I shall cover that later, but first let me state that I very strongly join the doubts that may exist here, if any, that a call for general standards to be laid down in all cases or in all states, I believe that to be unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.777" offset="10503481">Now while apologizing for not knowing the workings or the alleged troubles of the other states, I here today represent as I say, the State of Alabama and I strongly feel since I have actually engaged in these legislative facts, I strongly feel that our problem lies on having the one question answered whether the Alabama, whether Alabama can meet the equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment under the State Constitutional provisions, under our State Constitutional provisions providing for reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.265" offset="10677457">For instance, as you gentlemen well know, we have one section of our Constitution of States that our House shall be based on a population basis and shall be limited to 105 members giving any new county that's formed after the adoption the Constitution on additional member that's the reason our present House consists of 106 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.196" offset="10769199">We had one county -- my county, the baby county, Houston to be formed since the 1901 Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.936" offset="13808180">Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.739" offset="13827302">We have entered in the arguments during the last day, today and yesterday, I think the political picket and we've done this generally by adhering to standards of apportionment for questionings about standards of apportionment and comments on them, which vary from the shipping interest and their representation in the legislatures, the interest of labor and business, to mathematics and formula and really it seems to me that in the argument that if one fact becomes true, it is that the easiest judicially and most -- most easily judicially maintainable standard of apportionment can certainly be population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.045" offset="14036595">Regardless of all the problems that may develop and all the problems that may exist in many states, and may exist in many different counties and different districts, it would seem that surely, the one standard that is measurable in each instance leaving the less room for doubt and the less room for question insofar as each of the state legislatures of this nation are concerned, is the ascertainable standard of how many people are there in a legislative district or how many people are there in a representative seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.612" offset="14174835">Now in Alabama, the facts have been adequately noted with respect to the existing apportionment of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.247" offset="14213392">They have had no reapportion since 1901 and the people of Alabama have no place to go in order to seek redress for their grievances other than the United States Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.227" offset="14253307">The state courts of Alabama have refused to take jurisdiction; there is no initiative and referendum in the state; the legislature for 60 years refused to reapportion and there is of course no conception that they would change their minds except under a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.704" offset="14351214">And the constitutional convention provisions that are provided in our Constitution allow the state legislature, and provide for the state legislature to establish the method of representation of conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.561" offset="14398652">And it is inconceivable to me that over -- especially there might have been long lapse in apportionment that where we have or to have another constitutional convention, that the legislature of Alabama would alter in its default with respect to apportionment by selecting delegates for that convention who would apportion them out of their seats.</text>

            <text syncTime="3768.035" offset="15176579">Now, the 67-Senator Amendment also of course, in our judgment was complete nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.854" offset="15199775">The -- on its face, it purported to provide each county a little federal sort of plan with representation in the State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.155" offset="15245019">In the House of the 106 members of our House of Representatives, 67 of them are also allocated on the basis of political units or on the basis of some sort of little federal plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.162" offset="15297055">Now, we look at the -- the county argument and the use of -- and the use of counties and in the allocation of some weight for counties for representation purposes and it seems to me that -- as it has been stated by others that there is no comparison with the Federal Government, no proper comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.840" offset="15399769">There was no federal compromise with respect to counties, there is no and has never been any so-called sovereignty in the counties that are created by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.012" offset="15448461">The counties are have only such right that are granted by the state legislature and by the State Constitution and the effect of the utilization of these political units, it seems to me would be rather disastrous as far as the Government of our state legislature is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.051" offset="15516588">It would seem to me that over a period of history, as America has developed, the United States Senate has been an effective instrumentality of Government, but is extremely doubtful to me that if the United States Senate were totally fragmented with fractional interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.204" offset="15585238">If the Senators did not run statewide, if they did not -- in a state like Alabama for instance, have to take into consideration the industrial interest of Birmingham and shipping interest of Mobile, the farm interest, the plantation and perhaps the Black Belt, the Tennessee Valley authority area and the Alabama Power Company area, it would seem to me that the representation that we might get in the Senate of the United States might well be a mere blocking rather than a useful sort of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.747" offset="15715432">But in most states in the union, there is divergence inside of the senatorial districts, a divergence of interest that molds itself and measures into the senator who comes -- who comes forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.084" offset="15756706">Now inside of the state, the principal usage for representative districts is to break down into smaller and smaller units the area of representation and the place and the people have representation so that one representative may at least know the will of the people whom he represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.478" offset="15826296">Now to me, if you go into any sense of area representation or any sense of political unit representation, you quite naturally have in it a rural bias because it just seems implicit to me that there is more farmland than there are city lands and in this nation, there are fewer farmers than are the city people and if you use land, or if you use political units without population being the guiding factor, then we must of necessity with representative – reach a representative standard which would be non-responsive to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.208" offset="15977179">And the function of the Government, of course, should be the -- its response to the people whom it governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.749" offset="16007377">The difference -- it seems to me boils down to the question of trust in people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.716" offset="16071220">If there's -- if in this country as I think the country's (Inaudible) says "if we assumed that power of self-government is the power of people to think and to reason and to vote and to properly represent them, to get their own representatives, then the Courts it would seem would be standard to protect the minority from the majority" but the majority surely should have the right to elect representatives in both Houses of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.336" offset="16197757">For if that right doesn't exist in both Houses then they only have equal protection of one-half of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.571" offset="16246659">Now in the Alabama case, the -- of course Baker v. Carr was decided on March 26, on a March 30th the District Court issued an order setting a hearing in a motion for preliminary injunction we filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.822" offset="16311651">The case moves rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.787" offset="16319592">On April 14th there was a hearing and on July 16th, therefore a special session of the legislature there was reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.122" offset="16348850">I am quite convinced in my own mind that -- that in the middle district of Alabama, the Court viewed the would-be reapportionment case there and found an effective remedy and under Court order had an election held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.665" offset="16423037">Fashioned a remedy, perhaps better than we could dream could be fashioned from far away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.862" offset="16451877">I am quite certain from the opinion of the District Court, that in its mind at the moment before your decisions on future cases, that in its mind at the moment, population is the standard which must be met as far as an the apportionment is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="4148.401" offset="16697950">Now, under that assumption, your Senate could be apportioned on the basis of seven senators for Jefferson County, three for Mobile and so forth which would be on the basis of pure population.</text>

            <text syncTime="4548.834" offset="18299779">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.880" offset="18315870">We are intervenors in the case below and in the court below, we join with the plaintiffs and I believe all of the intervenors in proposing to the court below that this case had reached a stage where the remedy of provisional reapportionment, as we proposed it, was the only effective way to which the Court could deal with the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.422" offset="18462051">They had previously, there were three remedies considered by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.526" offset="18486502">One was election -- requiring an election at large after the legislature had failed to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.758" offset="18515446">There was a remedy proposed of proportional voting of existing legislators, and there was the remedy of provisional reapportionment, all of which, we felt, were within the discretion of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.124" offset="18572915">However, in practical impact, it was our contention that for the Court to set up a temporary plan which the legislature itself could change either before a legislature was elected under that plan or after a legislature was elected in that plan, gave to the state and to legislature the full range of discretion and at the same time gave the litigants a full opportunity and full protection for their constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.832" offset="18735710">However, as you have noted from our appeal, we are here, in this Court, unlike Mr. Morgan, to say that we feel that action by this Court at this time is necessary in this case, and that is the subject that I want to discuss with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.240" offset="18821392">We come from a state that has 10% of the natural resources of America, mainland America.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.204" offset="18861202">This state has been locked in an impasse for the expression of the popular will of the people for over 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.453" offset="18910208">In this case, while this case was pending, we attempted to utilize every single way that was opened to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.040" offset="18952526">We backed the Jefferson County Democratic Campaign Committee and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.388" offset="18969976">We backed to proposals in the legislature, and we petitioned the legislature.</text>
