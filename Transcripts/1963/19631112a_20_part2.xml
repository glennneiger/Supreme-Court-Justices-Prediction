            <text syncTime="5.067" offset="124615">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.323" offset="137676">Before the recess, I was attempting to indicate without defining precisely what I meant by permissive -- permissible objectives of legislative apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.357" offset="185846">And I was suggesting that if -- if a state drew a line, in a way rationally related to one of those permissible objectives, then the apportionment would not run afoul of either my first, second or third general principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.899" offset="260033">Whether it runs afoul of the fourth principle, the one introducing a question of degree, remains to be covered, but up to this point, my argument would not condemn any apportionment aimed in such a direction, having such a function.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.650" offset="327011">The point I was trying to make was that those rules are fundamentally different from differentiations or classifications among voters whose function is to give the farmer more representation than the city dweller, the shipping interest, more representation than the wage earner, the city dweller, more or less than the suburbanite and so forth, or the Protestant or the Jew.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.207" offset="425232">The latter kind -- that whole latter class when applied to political rights, including representation, we say is the very antithesis of the ideal of equality before the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.082" offset="476745">Now, I find support for that proposition that it's the antithesis of equality before the law, in four places.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.394" offset="513944">In the first place, I suggest that the principle that their polity, the people as a whole, knows no distinction in the political worth of one man as opposed to another, is just as fundamental a strain in our constitutional parity as the principle that it knows no distinction in political matters between the naturalized citizen and the natural born citizen, according to religion or according to the red-headed man and the dark-headed man or the bald-headed man.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.814" offset="643615">We filed an elaborate appendix to our brief in the Maryland case, in which we show the extent to which the ideas of equal representation per capita was accepted in the constitutional convention of 1789 and in the ratifying conventions, as a principle applicable to any government, dealing directly with its own citizens and drawing its authority directly from the citizens in the 18th Century philosophy, as distinguished from a legislative body representing sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.218" offset="793245">The practice in later years fell somewhat short of the theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.965" offset="808291">Indeed, it was short of the professed ideal and at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.262" offset="829398">But nevertheless, each stage in our history has brought us closer to wiping out the distinctions between one man and another in matters of his political worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.008" offset="880389">As Justice Douglas said, in Gray and Sanders, the conception of a politically equality from the declaration of independence to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Amendments can mean only one thing and one man --</text>

            <text syncTime="216.148" offset="968997">Occasionally, one finds a political figure, praising the unique virtue of the rural voter or defending the preferred power of some special interest, but I know of no eminent statesman or political philosopher who has avowed to view that it is proper to wait the legislature, so as to assign to the farm interest, the wage earning interest, the urban interest or any other class or interest, a political power disproportioned to its numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.416" offset="1106087">That may have done in other countries but I think no one has ever urged that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.182" offset="1129075">You're jumping from one thing to another it seems to me Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.644" offset="1142972">Your first principle Gray against Sanders would say that it would be constitutionally impermissible in the Montgomery County District for example, to give two votes to the farmers in that district and only, one vote to the people who lived in Rockville or in -- or in the suburban communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.456" offset="1230221">That's -- that's one principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.638" offset="1234923">That's one principle that was decided in Gray against Sanders.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.064" offset="1244641">But now, you're jumping to something else, when you're talking about representation of an electorate, all of those voters counted fully and fairly in the election in a -- in a representative legislative assembly in the state capital, these are two different subjects.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.689" offset="1315171">I recognize they are two different subjects, one of my four sources, I'd be glad to deal with now, is Gray and Sanders and I submit that on this point, Gray and Sanders is logically decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.289" offset="1373581">I see no rate -- if it is impermissible, if it is contrary to our fundamental ideal of authority to give one man more weight than another or one group more weight than another, in choosing a governor, it would seem to me it was equally contrary to the notion of fundamental political authority to deliberately give one group more weight than another in choosing a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.702" offset="1479220">It seems to me that Justice Harlan in this respect was quite right when he said that there was no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.552" offset="1506597">Now, this does not, Mr. Justice Stewart, argue that Gray and Sanders is decisive of this whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.256" offset="1537421">It clearly isn't because legislative apportionment serves functions that elections within a single constituency do not serve, and I was trying to indicate those at the latter part of my argument this morning, but in terms of valuing a man who's a wage earner more than a man who's a lawyer or vice versa or according to his religion or anything else, in that field, I see no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.789" offset="1667511">It would seem to me that the holding that you can't differentiate between them when it comes to weighting their votes, is exactly the same that you can't differentiate between them or exactly the same reason in selecting the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.247" offset="1733339">Now suppose for example, a legislature was elected at large?</text>
            <text syncTime="412.504" offset="1754446">Now surely no one would say that you can weight the votes giving wage earners, 10 votes, lawyers, seven votes, bankers, one vote, clergymen, no votes, in electing the members of the legislature at large.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.553" offset="2134580">I would've thought that the rules applied when people didn't vote by class just as some of the rules for permissive -- some of apportionments for permissive purposes, as I've defined them, permissible purposes, may result of course, collaterally in giving more weight to the people who live in the rural areas than to the people who live in the urban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.999" offset="2236353">But it's not phrased in those terms as I understand it, the system of proportional representation is not phrased in those terms and it operates where the people happen to vote by class or don't vote by class.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.598" offset="2330812">Now, I've mentioned two of the four legs on which I put this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.505" offset="2362368">I suggest to you that the history of the practice in making state constitutions conforms to this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.531" offset="2402492">If you examine the state constitutions of the early ones and as they are today, you will find that the central principle, the chief one, is to base representation primarily on population, their qualifications and limitations, but if you examine them, you will find that they are virtually all consistent with the basic distinction that I've been seeking to draw between permissible purposes as I have defined them.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.613" offset="2534881">The limitations are addressed with rare exceptions, there are some, New York is one, to making the legislature more representative in the sense by avoiding the creation of excessively large district, by recognizing the coherence and independent identity and nerve center quality of independent political subdivision, by preserving a measure of stability and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.515" offset="2638430">No state constitution so far as I know has ever espoused the view that it is a proper function of representation to allocate political power to different social economic classes out of proportion to their number.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.078" offset="2704677">Very few have provided for a discrimination against populous areas merely because they are populous.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.629" offset="2734874">There are a few of those and that classification, unless it can be related to something else, would fall under my test.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.278" offset="2765490">The practice has been somewhat different, but I've never supposed that our shortcomings were the measure of our constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.865" offset="2803837">The fourth support for my argument is that it is already claimed that in closely related areas, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits the kind of discrimination that our third principle would condemn.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.971" offset="2868308">No one would argue that the state may deny the vote to bankers or wage earners, or lawyers, or farmers on the ground that it wants to encourage one class or discourage another, Mr. Justice Goldberg, each must be permitted the same opportunity to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.551" offset="2934554">It seems equally clear as I suggested a moment ago to Justice Stewart that at choosing a legislature; you couldn't give 10 votes to the banker, nine to the lawyer, and so on in different proportions to different people according to your conception of their work.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.466" offset="3166312">I'm not -- I have not yet suggested that any -- that a discrimination and per capita representation, it results from the States pursuing some permissible practice violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.082" offset="3232768">I'm coming -- I'm going to discuss that but I -- up to this point have simply said that you may not create preferred classes of voters for the sake of having preferred classes of voters in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.481" offset="3290342">Now, if you're acting for some other function, some of these things that I've suggested are permissible, then you have another promise to which I -- I may get today but if not, I will come to it in the Alabama case where this is far more squarely raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.484" offset="3358365">That's the problem that by analysis this far leaves on unsolved which every way one thinks it should be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.713" offset="3395250">I suggested a moment ago that Gray and Sanders in our view was dispositive of this question that it is different from the ultimate question because you may have an apportionment of which is aimed at achieving some permissible function of apportionment whereas when you're conducting an election, you can't have that kind of per capita discrimination result because those functions don't apply to elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.110" offset="3532863">Let me try to make that point a little clearer again by resorting to what may seem a silly illustration, but I think these silly illustrations do help us to get general rules without getting lost in numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.432" offset="3598169">Suppose that -- well, let me backup.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.055" offset="3620634">It would -- the utterly whimsical I take it, at a denial of equal protection to give the voters in the western half of the State twice the representation per capita of voters in the eastern half of the State simply because they live nearer the setting sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.154" offset="3697016">It would be equally impermissible in order to encourage the economic growth of that half of the State because that is not a proper function of legislative apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.164" offset="3737036">Now, it might be so far as what I have been saying goes entirely permissible for a State to give each county two senators because her policy was to represent counties and this one might conclude and I assume for the moment, it goes to make the legislature work better as a -- as a representative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.277" offset="3829509">If it happened that all the counties with -- that were sparsely populated were in the western half of the State proving that that was arithmetically true -- proving that arithmetically the people who live there had doubled the representation of the people of the eastern half being simply a collateral result and not the criteria for the differentiation would be in that they didn't violate this third principle as I have tried the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.612" offset="3958868">At this point, I would like to address myself if I may to press it with Justice Harlan asked just before the recess and that is, "What has the Fourteenth Amendment to do with this problem at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="976.565" offset="4010695">" It would seem to me, first, that the Fourteenth Amendment that the burden is on anyone who says the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply because it is general in its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.276" offset="4065552">It doesn't say everybody's entitled to equal protection of the law except in voting or equal protection of the law except and that is a representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.957" offset="4100242">It says that everyone is entitled to equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.053" offset="4116647">I don't suggest that's conclusive but I think it bears heavily and throws the honesty of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.276" offset="4145486">Second, it would seem to me that this was implicit in the decision in Baker and Carr, that the point has really been adjudicated and I note that connection that Justice Frankfurter in his dissenting opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.884" offset="4267948">Well, I'm happy -- happy to find Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.640" offset="4282995">The lower courts have all thought that it was clearly indicated by Baker and Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.923" offset="4304102">I know too that Justice Frankfurter in his dissenting opinion assumed that the Equal Protection Clause has -- or stated that it has some application to some of the silly examples that I have put earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.417" offset="4350077">I have put them because it seems to me that we would all agree that the Equal Protection Clause has some application in this field and they really were directed to that point and finally, for reasons that I've stated a moment ago, I think that Gray and Sanders squarely resolves that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.278" offset="4433460">I would like to take the remaining moment to apply my third principle to the New York case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.842" offset="4479749">We submit that the apportionment of the New York Legislature violates the Equal Protection Clause because the rule of apportionment in the Constitution discriminates between the favored and disfavored classes of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.132" offset="4540876">On the basis of criterion having -- criteria having no relevance to any permissible purpose of legislative apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.957" offset="4576193">The Constitution itself provides that the per capita representation of voters living in any county was more than 6% of the population shall be limited to a fraction, now about 60%, of the per capita representation accorded to people who live in a county with less than 6% of the State's population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.283" offset="4673578">The sole function of the formula, I think it could be shown without any question, is to create politically favored, politically disfavored classes of voters classifying them according to the number of their neighbors that it lives here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.650" offset="4735018">Now, the State makes three arguments in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.964" offset="4748288">First, they say that there are many matters of legislative concern that are having importance to the counties that are handled through the counties and this I am sure is true, but this doesn't justify the rule in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.696" offset="4803145">That's taken care of by the one representative from each county in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.525" offset="4822476">There is no such purpose in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.309" offset="4829581">There are counties who don't have a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.589" offset="4842747">Second, the counsel says that the apportionment formula would limit the physical size of a district -- the physical size of the districts because physical size may have a significant bearing on a voter's capacity that influenced the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.549" offset="4910561">Well, I put it a little differently but nevertheless, I acknowledged earlier that physical size might be a permissible purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.297" offset="4941594">But the fault in New York's argument is that the formula for apportioning the Senate has no rational relationship to the goal of keeping down the size of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.604" offset="4990809">There's nothing in the formula that limits the geographical size of any district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.648" offset="5014946">There are states that do that and I couldn't make this argument with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.880" offset="5031873">California is one, Kentucky is another and perhaps there are more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.864" offset="5051831">The purpose of having somebody from every area is again served by the apportionment of the assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.567" offset="5082655">In addition, it can be shown that the rule that says that once a county grows and what's that first ratio county has more representatives than in 1894, those seats are assigned to the less populous or second ratio of counties is permanent even though the total number of first ratio seats diminishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.750" offset="5191429">So that you have a point of fact, a greater number of second ratio seats available today than you had in 1894 and if my calculations are right, they're available for a smaller area, so that this really can't be a direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.775" offset="5267498">It doesn't have any tendency to keep down the geographical size of district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.783" offset="5291530">In addition, if one examines the workings of this, he will find that what has been happening is that as the Constitution would permit, the geographical size of districts in New York has in fact been increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.745" offset="5351403">The people who have benefited are the counties that are getting two or more senators, but not enough to put them into first ratio the more populous county category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.238" offset="5409395">The rural areas are getting bigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.052" offset="5420575">The top three counties is now one senatorial district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.777" offset="5439488">In 1894, it was two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.018" offset="5448474">It is now a senatorial district that reaches from the Lake down to the Pennsylvania line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.109" offset="5468850">That used to be divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.467" offset="5474283">I got a list of the others that can be made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.895" offset="5487971">So that this rule, we say, does not tend to achieve either the purpose of keeping the geographical size of district small or any other permissible purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.519" offset="5534469">It is simply a classifying legislation aimed to give the rural voter more votes and our second principle, we think forbids that. The third argument is that New York must take into account, the unique concentration of population of political power in a few localities in order to assure that the wishes and needs of the rest of the State will not be ignored.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.921" offset="5736030">I should like to loose no time in coming down directly if I may to what it is to be a basic difference of opinion as to an issue which is cardinal I think to the determination of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.968" offset="5796216">I recall Mr. Sand saying on oral argument, pointing to certain pages of our brief that we express criteria, that we use arguments which actually support his views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.797" offset="5867583">Now, I want to make it crystal clear that on the matter of what constitutes equality of representation, we take sharp, very, very sharp issue with the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.353" offset="5921813">There is a basic difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.222" offset="5929336">I think it's beyond argument listening to the appellants, reading their briefs that they equate per capita representation with equality of representation and here, we disagree emphatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.603" offset="5994851">We only agree to the extent that we believe there should be equality of representation but what does that term connote?</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.874" offset="6035916">We see no necessary co-relationship between per capita representation and the equality of ac -- access to the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.085" offset="6084712">We don't regard per capita representation as the test, as the only test, or as the starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.586" offset="6118776">Basically, I think that difficulty lies in the question of the conception of a constituency and the -- the functions and purposes of a single member district system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.278" offset="6161512">Obviously, it's one thing to deal as this Court did deal only during the last term with a -- a statewide constituency in Gray against Sanders, and the Court laid down the rule while being careful in Mr. Justice Douglas' opinion to leave open the question of state apportionments, the Court did very definitely lay down the rule that insofar as a single constituency is concerned, a statewide election, there can be but one constitutional standard that they must raise one man, one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.849" offset="6307798">And there, the law has done everything it conceivably can do to guarantee to the 20 voters within the single constituency system the equality of access to the legislative process with every other citizen, but I submit that it's an entirely different matter when it comes to a single member district system with its series of constituencies leading to the election of representatives in a state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.323" offset="6429738">It's much more complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.530" offset="6438515">It's much more of a problem because you have -- in the very nature of this system, you have residents of different districts and indeed residents of the same district vying with each other for their legislator's attention and it's a matter which comes down to something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.092" offset="6520748">Isn't that a problem in reality of assuring that -- the man let's say in Schuyler County, the County with a citizen population of but about 15,000 has as much influence on his legislative representative as the man in New York or Kings County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.036" offset="6596504">Let's see how the question of physical size of the geographical area --</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving Galt</label>
            <text syncTime="1741.716" offset="7071305">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.514" offset="7074440">But assuredly, we -- we contend most vigorously that the Equal Protection Clause, when viewed against the rational that we will be discussing certainly will not and should not strike down New York's apportionment system in any respect and I was making some of these references to problems which exist irrespective of whether it's New York or another State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.612" offset="7174855">These may exist and I wanted to point out that for example, the physical size of the district to which so much reference was made in the Solicitor General's argument, in the appellant's argument, this matter of physical size of the district in reality is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.070" offset="7240683">You can take for example a citizen, let's call him A, who lives in a district of 5000 square miles and we have such a senatorial district in the State of New York, and a citizen B who lives in a district of one square mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.789" offset="7319573">Now, even if the populations were the same or they were dissimilar or anything else, it can hardly be said that the man living in the 5000 square mile county has equality of that access to his representative in comparison with the man living in the closely concentrated county with its much greater cohesion of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.894" offset="7411942">It's much more ready accessibility to the legislative representative, to the legislature itself and its ability to make its interest felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.784" offset="7455514">I can take for instance in the City of New York where you have high-rise apartment houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.140" offset="7480905">You can walk into the local movie house and you maybe in one or two assembly districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.160" offset="7501072">People may be coming one or two assembly in senate districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.563" offset="7514655">It's very easy for the people meeting in a PTA meeting to make their legislature know that they want a traffic light on the corner and they have no difficulty at all going to the very door of their legislature representative to tell him so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.173" offset="7577140">But it's quite a different thing when you take, for instance, St. Lawrence County up in the 40th senatorial district, up at the northeast part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.614" offset="7622802">That County alone is larger than the State of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.187" offset="7637117">I think it's something like 2700 square miles and the State of Delaware itself will be here on its own apportionment case, come the first week of December or so and yet, that has one assemblyman and it is part of a multi-county senatorial district, the three county-senatorial districts that expands an area larger than the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.552" offset="7730636">Now, what is important to a resident of St. Lawrence County for instance, who lives near the seaway, the St. Lawrence seaway or who's interested in the -- in the smelting operations that occur in one part of the county, is of no interest whatever to the fellow who lives on the other edge of that same county or elsewhere in that county or maybe a farmer or something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.423" offset="7978068">Here, we hear discussions and we hear arguments from the appellants and from the Solicitor General about the size of districts and we know that this still occurs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.905" offset="8036059">Well, obviously the enlargement of the senate rule is -- is intended to keep the size of districts down and with what New York has, we still have an occasional district which is that large and which does present the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.523" offset="8090499">And of course Your Honor can see that there will be several alternatives if we carry this idea of enlarging to a great extent that we add so many people to our house for example that there can be no room for -- for compact discussion or on the other hand, we enlarge districts and we have more enlarged districts such as the 40th senatorial district, we have a real problem on our hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.286" offset="8193526">How then does New York or any State to that matter guarantee to each voters so far as it reasonably and possibly can and consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment equality of access to the councils of Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.726" offset="8251308">Certainly, the State consistent with the Equal Protection Clause must think in those terms and when you consider New York especially with its extremely or regular population density, you can see the kind of problems with which that State must conjure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.049" offset="9672579">Now, of course the county also is instrumental in initiating legislation in the legislature and suggesting legislation for the State legislature, but let's come back to the example that I was giving Your Honors of the New York County voter for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.363" offset="9757842">He's represented by a senator, a state senator whose entire constituency is in New York County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.489" offset="9782397">Not only that, there are other senators in New York County and he obviously had easy access to the legislature, no particular problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.452" offset="9818237">But come back again to the St. Lawrence voter where the senator represents this vast area including these other two counties and I have no doubt that any voter in St. Lawrence County would rightly say under those circumstances that he's not equally represented with his counterpart in New York County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.729" offset="9899321">In fact, he has a situation in the senatorial district where two other counties are competing for State A for the attention of the State senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.116" offset="9940908">Now, I say all of this to indicate to some extent what Mr. Justice Stewart referred to during the appellant's argument as some of the complexities and nuances in the question of securing and achieving equality of representation in a single member district system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.928" offset="10016141">As a matter of fact, it goes further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.589" offset="10026799">New York County senator to project further the example is in reality, in a delegation of senators from New York County, senators and assemblymen and they very frequently vote in a block, not only in the county but in the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.240" offset="10089388">This is common knowledge and it's a perfectly natural and expected thing and the concept of neighborhood in New York County for example would be such that a so-called neighborhood might well encompass several assembly districts and possibly more than one senate district and it's difficult to say that equality of representation is achieved when one small, physically small area for instance of that time has such solid control of the legislature has such a -- an influential voice in the legislature through its block, through its delegation, through its solidity, through its institutional power that the interest of other areas may very, very easily be ignored.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.247" offset="12177408">In short, people who cannot be heard or whose voice is varying people, are people who are not equally represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.907" offset="12216069">And so we say that we can think of at least four factors which might well be taken into consideration in any apportionment system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.412" offset="12258074">There are maybe others, if we had a year to think about them, we'd probably find more but four that we can think of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.722" offset="12279286">First and foremost obviously, the one with so much reference has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.571" offset="12298721">It's an obvious one of the per capita representation idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.235" offset="12317320">And if the kind of problems we have been discussing a few moments ago were not present, there might be little justification for departure from it, but these problems assuredly all present, they can't be ignored, certainly not New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.750" offset="12383357">They do exist and although New York adheres quite closely to a per capita standard, there are other ingredients that it takes into account; for instance, the guarantee of one representative to one county, the minimum guarantee that each county should have a representative, which is the system used in our state assembly, in one of the two chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.934" offset="12476144">Now, I don't think it's all debatable, but that, in the light of the close relationship that exists between county and state governments and the problems such as I have mentioned them and that they must be infinitely more of access to the state legislature especially where the county governments are concerned makes this very often a vital feature and a few moments ago, we heard the Solicitor General very frankly concede as much and incidentally, his fire was directed virtually not at all against the assembly and this is one of the reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.753" offset="14031370">And the fact that it can do so in a State with such irregularity of population of such size, of such extreme problems, of such extreme comparisons of population, and do these and would still maintain its 12th ranking on a per capita stand at the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4097.585" offset="16494717">That's quite a different thing and in that connection, we referred I think, at pages 35 or 36 or 37 of our brief, page 51 of our brief, to certain figures which compared New York in this respect with all of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.881" offset="16551873">We took the David Maizenberg study, which was made in 1955 and reflected that an existing apportionment, which is still the apportionment 1950 -- under the 1950 census and it was found in this figure as accurate that New York ranks 12th in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.970" offset="16636301">But then there were figures that we used which might be somewhat misleading and I think I owe it to the Court, to tell them about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4381.550" offset="17630626">This is the reason why we have advocated for this Court in connection with its measuring of the situation, not the starting point of per capita representation, espoused by both the appellants and to some extent by the Solicitor General, but we have advocated that the starting point in the highest traditions of this Court and in accordance with the best concepts to develop decisional law under the Equal Protection Clause would be to see that the degree of responsiveness to the popular will, the degree to which citizens have access to the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.484" offset="17790286">We think they've for instance, in applying that, the application I think, is -- is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.346" offset="17817767">If you take a state like Tennessee, which was the subject of the Baker case, where it had a constitutional formula written many years ago, a formula which as I best desire -- I -- I can recall it at the moment, was more on an equal population standard basis, on a per capita basis would something like an apportionment of delegates to counties having two-thirds of the prescribed number and 60 years went by -- 70s -- almost 70 years went by and the State of Tennessee did not even reapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.670" offset="17951096">It didn't conform to the mandates of its own state constitution and there was as the opinion pointed out as the -- as the majority opinion pointed out and I recall Mr. Justice Clark's opinion speaking very emphatically about the lack of any such thing as initiative or referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.031" offset="18028523">The people had no remedy in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.064" offset="18040644">They're the legislature that locked itself into power as a self-perpetuating oligarchy, never mind the will of the people, and the people had no remedy, that's one kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.947" offset="18088187">Then very well, the State certainly would have to come along and justify the reasons behind the seemingly inexplicable situation and that I think, would be the Baker case, but New York is not Tennessee and the facts of the Baker case are not the facts of the WMCA case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5593.669" offset="22479057">It cannot be said to be dominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.426" offset="22486058">That recalls something that the Solicitor General said earlier today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.430" offset="22502149">He spoke of the difference between a theoretical majority of 41% in 1906, electing a majority and under the projected 1960 apportionment of something like 38% or 37 point something, just about 30% -- 37% or 38%, let's say 37%, but overlooked in that and the -- and the statement appears I think at page 35, page 23 of the Solicitor General's brief, is the fact that the 1950 apportionment, the one now, before the Court, the figure was 40.9% for the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.323" offset="22665676">Now, obviously, one-tenth of 1% is not going to cross the twilight zone and enter into the field of unconstitutionality and if what was a de minimis in 1906 with 41%, you have 40.9% in 1950 and 1953, surely no assault can be made from that standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.148" offset="22769016">And what great difference does 38% make?</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.440" offset="22782182">This is what I mean by the factor of population, not necessarily being crucial and determinative.</text>

            <text syncTime="6393.655" offset="25679057">Let me talk of what was evidently a -- a subject of some concern to many of the -- to those of the justices who asked questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6402.959" offset="25716255">What are these three criteria that we use?</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.459" offset="25726182">One is the guarantee of one assemblyman per county.</text>
            <text syncTime="6408.812" offset="25739661">I take it especially in view of the Solicitor General's concession that there is no need to labor that at any length.</text>
            <text syncTime="6418.325" offset="25777695">It -- but the Senate full ratio rule and the Senate enlargement rule were the two that -- the Court focused with it particular attention on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.357" offset="25821790">And I gave you as the reason for that was that it meets all three needs, the rules made all three needs of the State, confusion of representation, giving more seats to the less populous counties, promotes the possibility of single county, rather than multicounty districts and constituencies and it also restricts the tendency to overlord sprawling districts and in the essence of the provisions for enlarging the Senate, do very much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.807" offset="25947596">And these three rules represent the only departure, the only significant departures from per capita representation in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6470.132" offset="25984899">Now, we haven't argued from the federal analogy, but there's an interesting twist that has been given to that by the appellants and I'd like to refer to that for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6483.354" offset="26037770">They talk about the one-house situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.531" offset="26082492">They say, after first saying that it might be alright to have one house on a per capita standard and another using some deviations without expressly indicating what those deviations maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6509.749" offset="26143410">They, first of all, make an assumption which is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.385" offset="26157934">I think they are assuming that when they talk about the federal analogy in that respect, they are assuming that the House of Representatives which structurally is the model for our Assembly is based on a per capita standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6527.881" offset="26215926">And as Your Honors well know, every State is guaranteed at least one representative, whether it'd be Alaska or any other State, just as each county in New York is guaranteed one representative of the Assembly and oddly enough, the greatest source of disparity in -- in extremes, in disparity -- in extreme disparity occurs in the Assembly rather than in the New York Senate and -- which has as I say, the same guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.798" offset="26335566">But the Senate, where the attack has been sent at somewhat more great is actually much closer to a per capita standard than the Assembly which is modeled after the -- after the House of Representatives in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.714" offset="26407246">And we think it's relevant to note that the residence of the 6% counties who are the alleged victims of the urban discrimination do constitute a clear numerical majority capable of affecting a -- a change of constitutional formula.</text>

            <text syncTime="6616.513" offset="26570459">However, it's this -- it's only this -- primarily this one assemblyman per county standard which -- which takes it away to any extent from a population standard, to any significant extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="6671.907" offset="26791978">In 1915 and in 1916, votes were had one on say, constitutional convention, one on a proposal as I recall it, to amend the constitutional formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="6686.408" offset="26850074">We had it again in 1938, a constitutional convention had been voted on, had been called into a conclave and did put before the people a -- a formula, a new apportionment formula which was rejected and to come back to a question which was raised earlier by one of the Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="6709.446" offset="26942130">At that time, the Democrats were in control, in 1938, of the State legislature and yet the 1938 Convention, the election of delegates were mostly Republicans and the people rejected that proposal for a -- a -- an alteration of the constitutional formula and I come down to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.730" offset="27047351">Mr. Sand said that the people won't have an opportunity unless the legislature intervenes to vote upon the question of a constitutional convention until 19 -- 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="6746.401" offset="27089983">We had one only as recently as 1957, a vote put before the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6752.537" offset="27114538">Governor Harriman made as one of the issues on which that vote should be determined, he stressed it and we have indicated it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6762.230" offset="27153304">He emphasized the fact that he wanted to have a constitutional convention in order among other things to alter the apportionment formula.</text>
