            <text syncTime="126.300" offset="608528">Well, because the Courts haven't thrown the whole case out in similar situations in United States against Pink, in United States against Belmont, in the Court of Appeals in the Pons case.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.630" offset="649906">The Court proceeded, made no distinction between whether the expropriating government for the nationalizing government was a plaintiff for the defendant, and I think that the brief of the United States handles this question quite well, that this is purely a matter of accident in how the case happens to come before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.398" offset="720959">It really had nothing at all to do with the merits of the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.777" offset="886471">If the judge made rule in any event, but it's supported by a long line of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.466" offset="913220">I was discussing the Bahia de Nipe case, that being the name of the freighter that was brought into the Court in Norfolk and, as I said, the arguments there made by United Fruit were identical with the arguments that were made here by C.A.V.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.260" offset="980407">Now, the State Department moved in that case with the greatest rapidity and, in the argument before the Court of Appeals -- I don't know what happened before the District Court because I wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.936" offset="1015097">But, in the argument before the Court of Appeals, the United States Attorney pointed out the very great importance in political term that the United States could hardly refuse to do what Cuba had done the day before in returning property which had been hijacked, and it urged great speed upon the Court and the Court did, in fact, act with great speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.315" offset="1092629">Altogether, three weeks, I think, elapsed between the dis -- between the day that the ship came into the harbor and the denial of the State, pending a writ of certiorari by the Chief Justice here.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.200" offset="1136201">And, United Fruit argued, relying on the Sabbatino case, this case, that the property, the sugar, belonged to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.709" offset="1166190">And, the Government argued, as it does here, that the Act of state doctrine meant that the property belonged to the Cuban Government and the Chief Judge denied a stay, citing as authority, therefore, the Underhill and, I think, Ricaud cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.940" offset="1231182">C.A.V. apparently agrees with that decision and it says in a footnote that the decision was “compelled by urgent considerations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="292.873" offset="1274859">I think that's pretty important.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.428" offset="1285099">There's a question as to who is to decide what the urge and considerations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.972" offset="1299310">Are they the litigants to a lawsuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="301.215" offset="1308191">Are they the Court or is it State Department?</text>
            <text syncTime="304.156" offset="1319999">Who knows what the urge and considerations are in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="307.366" offset="1332851">Who is it that decides what is urgent and what is not urgent?</text>
            <text syncTime="310.839" offset="1346748">Are we to read the New York Times and, on the basis of that, decide that initial issue is an important political issue and that the Courts ought to decide one way or the other or are the urgent considerations more properly within the cognizance and the sole -- I suggest in this situation, sole cognizance of the executive department.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.826" offset="1430653">I submit that this is not the kind of an issue that a court ought to get into.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.689" offset="1446118">Not because it, in broad general terms, affects foreign affairs, but because, in a much more narrow sense, it affects the problem of the sovereignty of other nations and, in this case, it affects the rights, as I shall come to in a few minutes in discussing the problem of the freeze, if I get the time, the very mo -- very important question of the rights of other American property holders and the entire problem of settlement with foreign countries for a na -- with respect to the problem of compensation for nationalized property.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.504" offset="1585403">And, this isn't the first time this problem has arisen of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.704" offset="1610167">Now, the Court below, the Court of Appeals, relied on the Bernstein exception to the Act of state doctrine and I'm not going to discuss it, except to say that we don't believe there is any such thing as a Bernstein exception and that, even if there were, the respondent doesn't come into it and I'll leave that to the Solicitor General.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.588" offset="3665690">For example, it's suggested that the Court will have to determine what percentage of the corporation was owned by Cubans and what percentage by American citizens, and I don't even know how the Court will go about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.725" offset="3722324">Let me turn, however, to the question of whether, assuming that it was an American corporation, whether there has been any violation of international law here, and this is the last, assuming everything else is against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.798" offset="3786585">I submit that there is no violation of international law which here been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.016" offset="3807483">And, I would like just to point out that the world of today is not the world of 50 years ago and that the most striking feature of the world today, speaking in international terms, is a revolutionary search which has created scores of new countries and has brought about sweeping changes in the economic systems of many old ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.572" offset="3885641">No longer can we look to the law of the United States in Western Europe and, on the basis of that research, discover what is international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.142" offset="3919914">If international law is the practice of civilized nations, and so the Courts so text write it at least and I guess the Courts have also held the decision by Chief Judge Marshall in the Antelope, I think is a very good example, we have to look not only to our law but to the law of Eastern Europe, the law of Africa, the law of Asia, the law of Latin America, to Ceylon, to Indonesia, to Egypt, to Cuba, to China, to name only a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.443" offset="4029106">And, we can't just look at American presidents, and German presidents, and French presidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.008" offset="4051362">I submit that there is nothing to show that international law, namely the practice of civilized nations, makes what Cuba did here a violation of any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.602" offset="4097755">On the contrary, it seems to me that a very large proportion of the nations of the world, perhaps representing a substantial majority of the population of the world, have done exactly what Cuba has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.217" offset="4140283">It certainly has been done in Indonesia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.267" offset="4844440">Now, we have here an Act which is trying to be statutory, retaliatory, and no compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.095" offset="4871711">Now, I would like to save some time for rebuttal and I really don't have time to consider all of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.499" offset="4897416">They're fully discussed in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.259" offset="4908387">I might say that, so far as the discrimination is concerned, this is was one of a series of decrees which nationalized United States property, Cuban property, English property, Canadian property, Taiwan property, and lots of other property that was located in Cuba and, while this particular decree was directed to a particular group of companies, other decrees were related to other ones and I don't think that there was any difference of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.810" offset="5014653">All of them were rela -- were expropriated in exactly the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.270" offset="5036492">Also, there's been no determination anywhere, no facts have been taken to determine whether this was a discrimination and what the -- whether the discrimination was a proper one, that is, equal treatment is not always the same as discrimination because, sometimes, equal treatment is not appropriate where the parties are unequal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.443" offset="5105142">The Government has al -- or the respondent has also claimed that this was retaliatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.392" offset="5128965">The Court of Appeals said that, well, this was a retaliation for the Sugar Act of 1960 and, whether the Sugar Act was fair or unfair, nevertheless, Cuba had no right to retaliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.030" offset="5183509">Well, whether it's fair or unfair, in the Court of Appeals' own opinion, is a rather important thing and I don't think we can brush off the standard of fairness just because it's a matter that it is applied to the law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.761" offset="5226454">If the standard of fairness is to be applied and that's a reason for a court's decision, then it should be applied to all of it and I don't think that the issue of fairness can be applied only to the Cuban decrees and not to American law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.910" offset="5275042">And, finally, I would like to get very briefly to the question of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.467" offset="5297194">the Court of Appeals says there is no international law on the subject of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.208" offset="5320182">The respondent and C.A.V. don't accept that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.217" offset="5336273">I suspect that's the issue that they are mostly interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.766" offset="5346408">If they could get compensation, I don't think they'd be worried too much about the discriminatory or retaliatory aspect of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.925" offset="5375039">There are extensive citations in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.755" offset="5382353">I think most of the extensive nationalizations of the world in the past, well, since 1917 and perhaps before that, were without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.993" offset="5415372">Now, it's true that in many cases, compensation was worked out ultimately, but it was worked out by diplomatic methods and, as the Solicitor General suggests here, perhaps, someday, compensation would be worked out by diplomatic methods now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.219" offset="5468244">And, now, I'd want to get to Your Honor's question on the freeze because I think it ties in with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.351" offset="5488828">In the first place, the freeze is not an absolute freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.197" offset="5500113">It's a freeze subject to license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.688" offset="5510144">If we worked to secure a judgment in this case, we would applied to the Treasury Department and we would seek to get a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.979" offset="5535326">And, the Treasury Department would decide in determining, in the light of its then existing policy, whatever it happened to be, whether it would give us a license on that or not, and that would be handled in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.594" offset="5617768">I don't know whether it will be the policy the day that this Court hands down a judgment in our favor or whether it will be the policy 2 years from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now, or whenever an application for a license is made, because it is a policy question the Treasury Department will have to determine policy on the basis of the facts as they exist at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.563" offset="5689657">The second answer is that our previous experience has been, in the case of blocked funds, that when blocked funds are accumulated, and this would be the beginning or at least part of the beginning of an accumulation, it has been the experience in the past that those blocked funds have frequently been used in the future, 5 years, 10 years, in the case of the Soviet Union, 25 years later, to work out some sort of a diplomatic settlement, whereby, all American property owners receive that -- receive some sort of a share of the funds -- the blocked funds that had accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.207" offset="5860185">Perhaps that will happen in this case if we prevail but, if we don't prevail, it means that those funds presumably will belong to Farr, Whitlock and that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.119" offset="5895816">Now, there are many, many aspects of the freeze which could be discussed and which, if it ever becomes appropriate, will be discussed but I don't think that the freeze makes the matter moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.950" offset="5947120">It may raise some question as to how soon, if ever, we will realize the fruits of a victory we may win here and it may take a long time and it may be hard for us to get the fruits of those victory -- of that victory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.349" offset="6000724">But, the alternative is to hand the money over to Farr, Whitlock and, that, we believe, is not justified on the record here and it is not going to be affected by the freeze one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.726" offset="6054327">Those frozen funds may someday come in handy and, as I say, in connection with the diplomatic settlement or some other kind of settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.677" offset="6162056">Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.483" offset="6173341">The United States appears today as amicus in this litigation to argue only the act of state question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.513" offset="6209390">That question is phrased on page 2 of the Government's brief, “whether a court of the United States is free to examine the validity of the decree of a recognized foreign government affecting title to property within its territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.504" offset="6293400">Now, as Mr. Justice Goldberg has raised the question, it was answered by Mr. Rabinowitz, I'd like, at the outset, to say that I agree that this case is not a moot case for the reasons essentially expressed by Mr. Rabinowitz that the Treasury Department regulations do prevent the transfer, and so forth, of any assets except under a license and that those assets are presently frozen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.359" offset="6412831">However, a judgment is not prohibited and there is a long line of decisions in this Court that says that a -- where a judgment can be rendered to clarify title to something or the rights of someone, even if those proceeds are frozen at that point, that that case is not a moot case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.393" offset="6496946">I would also like to point out that the fact of that regulation has some relevance to matters, which I'll make later in my argument, because it demonstrates, to a degree, a -- an efficient way of dealing with problems of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.438" offset="6573119">That is to say, again Mr. Rabinowitz had paid some note of it, often, these claims for property which is confiscated by a foreign government can be paid from such frozen assets and, in any event, the fact of the frozen assets is sometimes an inducement to a foreign government to discuss the problem of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.986" offset="6679280">I think there's no need for me to go over the essential facts again, but I would like to give emphasis to the two facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.279" offset="6720449">One is that there is no question that the sugar involved in this case was in Cuba at the time of the relevant decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.493" offset="6761305">And, the second fact that I would like to give emphasis to is that possession of that sugar was taken on behalf of the Cuban Government and that the title of the Cuban Government at that time was recognized by Farr, Whitlock, at least for the purposes of releasing the sugar to get it on to the ultimate purchaser, so they we're not dealing here with a decree which simply was sort of a bruiting omnipresence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.066" offset="6887633">We're dealing with a decree which was in fact, where measures -- inappropriate measures by those standards were taken by the Cuban Government to reduce that sugar to its possession in Cuba.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.278" offset="9172511">Well, it is perfectly true that there's a whole line of decisions and authority with this respect to such decrees which says that courts in the United States will not enforce confiscatory decrees, will not enforce decrees which are penal in their nature, which will not enforce decrees which have public policy exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.875" offset="9258924">There's a whole -- just hundreds of cases to this effect, but this case is not a case of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.515" offset="9285465">This case is not a case of that kind because, here, the property was reduced to the possession of the Cuban Government while in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.949" offset="9323186">And, it's a mere accident that the case appears in the way in which it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.166" offset="9348054">As to say, if it had not been for the accident of some negotiable paper being in the hands of Farr, Whitlock in this case, then the only thing that C.A.V. could have done would have been to have attempted to enjoin that payment or to have sought the money from the -- in the hands of the agent of the Cuban Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.175" offset="9436035">In doing so, I think it would have been blocked either -- be it by sovereign immunity if this case was directly against an agent of the Cuban Government or the Cuban Government, or it would have been blocked by the Act of state doctrine if in the hands of somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.914" offset="9503013">There, it would have been used as a matter of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.752" offset="9510431">So, I cannot attach any great significance to the rather odd fact here in the rather unique circumstances that this happens to be an argument made by a plaintiff in defense of his title because the money seems to have -- or what represent of the money slipped out of his hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.066" offset="9575633">I don't believe it would be wise for this Court or for any court to make that kind of distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.279" offset="9604472">To say you contest the title if you are able to get hold of the property, however you get hold of it but, otherwise, it's barred because it makes a difference whether you appear as plaintiff or as defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.991" offset="9651388">I don't believe that would be a wise route.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.025" offset="9863502">And, in that case, this Court first pronounced that doctrine and said that, and the quote which is so often quoted in the cases, “that every sovereign state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state and the Courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.336" offset="10004668">In the case such as Underhill against Hernandez, it would seem look like a part of a sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.939" offset="10031104">And, the same argument can be made that if the State takes property and then gives it to a third person, since you couldn't sue the foreign state for it, you can't sue that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.202" offset="10072168">But, it isn't -- it isn't distinct from sovereign immunity because sovereign immunity can only come to play when the sovereign is in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.780" offset="10114487">It's a -- it's a jurisdictional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.121" offset="10123891">The act of state is not and, in addition to that, it would seem to me that the main motivation of those who are arguing this, derived from sovereign immunity, is to take the next jump and say “we don't like sovereign immunity anymore, so we don't like act of state anymore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.445" offset="10193168">Now the reasons that sovereign immunity has been cut down in some ways has been because of the extent to which governments were involved in commercial activities rather than in what we regarded as more purely governmental activities and, perhaps, the same exception could be made here, but I wouldn't know how to do it because, clearly, when the Government of Cuba takes this sugar there, it's not acting in a commercial way, even though the product may be commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.390" offset="10292955">It's acting -- affecting in a pretty sovereign way, perhaps, too sovereign a way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.767" offset="10402461">It does not seem to me that that applies to the acts done in its sovereign capacity and, certainly, expropriation is not an act done in a commercial capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.202" offset="10468185">Now, it's been argued that these cases, the -- primarily, the Underhill case and the Oetjen case and the Ricaud case which are the clearer statements of this -- by this Court, it has been argued by scholars for some time that perhaps this doctrine should be changed and perhaps it's no longer applicable today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.306" offset="10564629">There has been some efforts to distinguish those cases and, to a degree, they can be distinguished.</text>

            <text syncTime="2648.861" offset="10698794">I think they're respectable arguments, but I think that this Court ought to face the fact quite candidly that what, as I think, the respondents do, that they are asking for a change in this doctrine when they ask that an exception for alleged violations of international law be made to the Act of state doctrine because it is quite clear from those cases and from the way in which the Court spoke in those cases that it had considered this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.607" offset="10813837">At least it was aware of this fact, because, in each of those cases, there is a statement that the remedy, if it exists, lie through diplomatic channel, which is certainly a recognition of the fact that international matters were involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.355" offset="11016756">I think that the point that I've been making is that the precedent, as it exist, would very clearly apply to the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.389" offset="11052910">Now, let me use my remaining time, if I may, to deal with what seem to me to be the most important matter before this Court, and that is whether, today, it would be a wise policy to create the exception to this doctrine which respondents have urged so vigorously and which was adopted quite clearly by the District Court and a little more equivocally, I think, by the Court of Appeals because it gone ahead to further Bernstein letter exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.568" offset="11205674">And, that is that, to the Act of state doctrine, a -- an exception exists wherever there is an allegation that the acts of a foreign state were in violation of international law and the Court is then free to check at least that much and to investigate international law for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.489" offset="11297311">Now, it seems to me that, for the Court to examine into a foreign act of state on those grounds, could interfere with the conduct of foreign relations and, indeed, both of the Courts below acknowledged this because both of them give emphasis to the fact that, in this case, it could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.611" offset="11397831">The District Court, because they said that the foreign state had already said this was in violation of international law so, therefore, it couldn't defend the Cubans anymore than they were already offended and, the Court of Appeals, because it said we have a Bernstein letter coupled with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.939" offset="11459166">So, both courts below, at least accept the fact that this Court interfere with -- with the foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.953" offset="11491140">Now, why is this true?</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.291" offset="11500544">Well, one thing that's true about it is, because the -- this kind of pronouncement can become a problem of time, as far as the Department of State is concerned, they have other fish to fry than this particular expropriation or this particular act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.589" offset="11561775">And, it may be that the timing of a protest is important to them, whereas, the timing of a judicial pronouncement could not take into account the same factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.255" offset="11604407">And, there is the problem of phrasing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.048" offset="11611512">If, after all, the effort here is it to -- is to get compensation for the people involved whose property has been taken, if it is to resolve those relations so the future foreign freight can go on, the very serious problems of phrasing of a protest can come up, can exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.050" offset="11691551">For example, if the protest that you made, the reasons why it was in violation of law, were phrased in one way, you might be able to secure similar notes from other governments which did not agree with everything that you felt was true of international law, then this situation would agree with some of them and it might be the better part of wisdom to give emphasis to those points so as to secure similar protests from other governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.617" offset="11805863">And, in addition to that, you have the problem here of -- as a problem of phrasing in an area of developing a law which isn't entirely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.145" offset="11863960">What international law is, with respect to its appropriations is, I assure this Court, not a crystal clear proposition, however clear it may be on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.665" offset="11901994">And, different states do have different views on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.550" offset="11925608">For the Courts of this country to pronounce, with respect to what international law presently is, in their view, in this area is, I think, seriously to affect the conduct of our foreign policy for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.767" offset="11990392">The Department of State is, of course, when it invokes international law in these situations, playing the role of an advocate and there is no question as to what the United States would like international law to be within this area because we would like to a have international law which would, in our judgment, protect foreign investment which would encourage development, which would create a climate of investment of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.557" offset="12101569">Now, already, in this case, by the expressions of doubt on the part of the Court of Appeals as to whether, for example, compensation was really required, already, the negotiating position of the Department of State, in this respect, to position it as an advocate, as urging in an external arena, is already, to an extent, hurt by the pronouncement here by the Court below as to how it looked at international law because, now, every time that the Department of State is to urge a position with respect to expropriation, it is going to have that opinion and, should this Court reverse the prior precedent or modify it, it's going to have every opinion by every court state and federal in the United States, by 50 state jurisdictions, by a number of federal jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.456" offset="12325177">It's going to have to cope with all those expressions of what international law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.415" offset="12349001">Is this really -- I would this Court, is this really the way in which international law can develop?</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.777" offset="12374497">Isn't -- in this development, don't we have certain policy values that we wish to promote and aren't these better promoted in an external arena than by the pronouncement of courts sitting in this country, pronouncements which have to be and should be and properly should be objective decisions, objective views as to what international law is when, really, your arguing what it is as a policy argument in hope that it will become that or something approximately like it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.651" offset="12505945">But, really, is what the Department of State is doing, attempting to get others to take their views, it seems to me that rather than promote international law, judicial decisions of this kind would really be a deadening weight upon its development and, at least upon its developments in lines which I think that -- we would wish to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.043" offset="12583581">And, if they follow the Department of State in their pronouncements, then all they would have done would have been to impugn their own reputation for objectivity in courts abroad and the decisions would be reviewed not as good decisions with respect to international law, but merely as the expression of parochial and nationalistic views.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.389" offset="12676890">The second major point that I would make is that this is not a deterrent to foreign expropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.038" offset="12707506">If indeed the -- all of the powers given to the Executive Branch under the Trading with the Enemy Act, if we can freeze all the funds, if we can cut off all aid and assistance, if we can prevent the importation of any of the property, if we can exercise all of our not inconsiderable persuasive powers around the world in this respect it -- and this does not deter the foreign government from a violation of international law with respect to the seizure of property, why on earth is a decision by the Court in the Southern District of New York going to have that momentous effect upon a foreign government?</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.419" offset="12873017">In fact that the Courts in the United States been widely separated incidental, not very frequent occasions, would declare it to be in violation of international law, as to act as a deterrent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.229" offset="12916276">I'm simply unpersuaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.297" offset="12928606">And, I'd like to add to the final point, this Court to think very seriously, what it would be doing because I think it would be opening the doors of this Court to a flood of litigation, and let me suggest at least one way in which this might be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.389" offset="12988897">At the present moment under the law, this Court and others courts of the United States will examine foreign judgments which are unexecuted on certain limited grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.821" offset="13030693">And, normally, we get a summary judgment using that foreign judgment to support it, but no court in the United States has ever looked behind an executed foreign judgment, a foreign judgment into which a -- which a foreign court said A owes B so much money besides that, and then A pays B that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.870" offset="13130898">Now, do you -- that would be, it seems to me, perfectly appropriately and has been suggested by the commentators to be the act of a foreign government, a foreign act of state if, now, on that judgment, a man is to come into court, Mr. B is to co -- or Mr. A is going to come into court and say “B really owes me $25 because I didn't get an international due process in the trial of that case, wherever it may have been.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.359" offset="13244792">Because it seems to me that when you say acts of a foreign government, made effective within their own territory, completely carried out within their own territory are, nonetheless, subject to reexamination if they're in violation of international law, that you buy the whole package when you do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.474" offset="13321279">You buy everything which has been called or claimed to be a denial of justice under international law when you take that and you open up the doors of American courts to review all of the judgments of foreign courts, executed and unexecuted, where a plaintiff can make an allegation that his rights, under international law, had in some way been deprived.</text>

            <text syncTime="4189.234" offset="16860348">Cuba is an unfriendly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.665" offset="16870066">Cuba has a power into its courts neither the United States nor its nationals can obtain justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.939" offset="16895143">Cuba adopted a confiscatory decree directed exclusively at nationals of the United States, a decree which was denounced at the time by our Government as a violation of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.590" offset="16941746">Cuba now comes into our courts and asks to use the processes of these courts to enforce that decree against nationals of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4238.937" offset="17059088">First, that Cuba has no standing to sue in our courts because Cuba is a foreign sovereign not entitled to comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.601" offset="17097749">Secondly, that whether or not Cuba is entitled to comity, Cuba is not entitled to prosecute this action in our courts because this is an action to enforce a public law and no sovereign may enforce its public laws in the Courts of another sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.497" offset="17173400">Mr. Seymour will show that the nationalization decree of August 6, 1960 was in breach of international law, that the Act of state doctrine does not apply and the decision here, favorable to Cuba, will violate public policy of the forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="4788.330" offset="19256717">The contracts are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.550" offset="19261524">Section 7 deals with payment, and I think there's no question of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.528" offset="19277511">Now, I submit that what has happened here is that, in substance, Cuba confiscated the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.388" offset="19312933">That the contracts where New York shows as an action enforceable in c -- in New York -- in New York only and that the substance of what has happened here is that Cuba is now attempting an extra territorial application of the confiscation decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.747" offset="19386389">In other words, the net result of all that happened was that the Banco Exterior, as the foreign trade agency of Cuba, acquired -- New York shows as an action which Cuba is now coming into the New York courts or into the federal courts sitting in New York in order to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.082" offset="19459741">Now, I come to the first legal proposition which I shall advocate that Cuba has no standing to sue in the Courts of the United States in any kind of case because Cuba is not entitled to comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.636" offset="19533928">A foreign sovereign may sue in the Courts of the United States only by virtue of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.272" offset="19556498">This Court has so held on a number of occasions, and I do not understand that my learned friend questions that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.043" offset="19583561">Now, comity has two elements - first, friendliness and, second, reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.166" offset="19608012">Neither of those elements exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.674" offset="19634030">In my brief, I cite a number of barely hostile statements and actions taken by Cuba and the United States against each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.931" offset="19687111">I put most of them in the appendix because it did not occur to me that anyone could seriously challenge the fact that Cuba and the United States are unfriendly today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.216" offset="19728280">However, on receiving Mr. Rabinowitz's reply brief last Thursday, I find that he does maintain that, for purposes of comity, Cuba and the United States are friendly powers, and he says that the only cases in which the privilege to sue -- privilege of suit was denied because of unfriendliness are cases in which the countries involved were either at war or did not recognize each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.932" offset="19839143">And, he points out that, in this situation, Cuba and the United States are not at war and that Cuba and the United States do recognize each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.516" offset="19881462">I suggest, however, that there is a third type of situation which is inconsistent with friendliness, which affirmatively establishes unfriendliness, and that type of situation is when there has been a severance of diplomatic relations and a prohibition of all commercial intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.821" offset="19958680">And, here, I have to go outside my main brief because I am dealing with arguments that I only learned of on Thursday when I received Mr. Rabinowitz's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.618" offset="20001834">Now, I want to refer -- and Mr. Rabinowitz makes a persuasive argument, or a plausible argument perhaps, that the Courts cannot sit on statements issued by governments about each other that, in the last four or five months, we have issued critical statements about France, South Vietnam, Haiti, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.006" offset="20079365">And, he argues that there must be some tangible event, and the only tangible events that he says exists are nonrecognition and war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.914" offset="20123042">And, in answer to that, I suggest that there is a third type of tangible situation, namely, as I say, the severance of diplomatic relations and the prohibition of commercial intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.053" offset="20163584">Now, let me recite events -- concrete events which cannot possibly dis -- be dismissed as mere statements, as when, for instance, Assistant Secretary of State Martin says “our policy towards Cuba is not coexistence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.034" offset="20235473">We want to get rid of Castro and Communist influence in Cuba.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.969" offset="20251251">These are definite specific actions as concrete as war or as nonrecognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.783" offset="20282493">Now, on October 19 -- and all these events had occurred, some events referred to in my brief occurred before the nationalization decree, others have occurred since.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.673" offset="20326066">On October 19, 1960, the United States prohibited all exports to Cuba with a few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.021" offset="20355427">January 3, 1961, the United States terminated diplomatic relations and it terminated those relations under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.209" offset="20388237">At 1:20 a.m., on the morning of January 3, 1961, that is to say, in the middle of the night, the Cuba Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented a note at the United States Embassy in Havana, instructing the Embassy to reduce its personnel to 11 people within 48 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.574" offset="20461693">The President of the United States regarded that as insulting and terminated diplomatic relations on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.784" offset="20490533">On September 7, 1961, the United States prohibited assistance to any country which assists Cuba, unless the President shall otherwise determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.948" offset="20523133">On February 3, 1962, the United States proclaimed a complete embargo on all trade with Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.303" offset="20548629">On March 4, 1962, the United States prohibited the import of merchandise from anywhere, made or arrived in whole or in part of products of Cuban origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.758" offset="20594395">On July 8, 1963, they were issued the freezing orders to which reference had been made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.898" offset="20614980">The United States blocked all assets of Cuba and residents of Cuba, prohibited all persons subject to the United States jurisdiction from the unlicensed transfer of dollars to Cuba, and prohibited all unlicensed transactions of any kind with Cuba or residents of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.646" offset="20677987">Now, this, I submit, Your Honors, are measures of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.378" offset="20700871">They are tangible events.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.441" offset="20709125">They do not require a weighing by a court of whether or not a particular statement is so unfriendly that it amounts to unfriendliness in the sense of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.585" offset="20753742">These statements -- these actions cannot possibly be reconciled with friendliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.249" offset="20776417">Now, if we -- if the Court now -- I will say -- I think I can s -- concede it that Mr. Rabinowitz is correct that the only case is not finding friendliness in the sense of comity are cases in which there was either war or nonrecognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.864" offset="20850813">However, there is no case in which friendliness in the sense of comity was found to exist where diplomatic -- relations had been terminated or where commercial intercourse had been prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.123" offset="20907865">In other words, the question is an open one and I submit that in the sense in which comity is used in the various cases which are referred to in my brief, and as I believe these statements are all admitted by the other side, I submit that these are effective ways of establishing that unfriendliness.</text>

            <text syncTime="5664.219" offset="22760260">And, I suggest also that this requirement of the appearance by an accredited representative, as distinguished from private counsel, has a real application to litigation by Cuba in our courts, and that that is shown by the case of Rich against Naviera Vacuba, a case which is cited with great enthusiasm by my learned friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.474" offset="22869243">In that case, it appears that Cuba was entitled -- was held entitled to repudiate a formal court stipulation entered into under the most solemn circumstances, by which, Cuba waived sovereign immunity with respect to the execution of the judgment which was entered into in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.735" offset="22958268">And, yet, because that stipulation was entered into by private counsel and the Court opinion indicates that private counsel was acting within the scope of his authority, that he was duly authorized to do so, there was no question of the propriety of the behavior of private counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.531" offset="23017514">But, because he was only a private counsel and not an accredited representative, therefore, Cuba was permitted to repudiate that stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.117" offset="23055862">I -- I might say that Rich against Naviera Vacuba is the case involving the buoyed need which has been referred to by Mr. Rabinowitz in the course of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.963" offset="23107271">Now, another essential element of comity is reciprocity, and this essential element exists wholly apart from friendliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.912" offset="23155022">The leading case laying down the law on reciprocity as the essential element of comity is Hilton against Guyot, a case in which the question before the Court was the effect to be given to a judgment of the Courts of France.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.713" offset="23206222">At the time of that decision, there was on question of unfriendliness between the United States and France.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.676" offset="23230046">The decision came down in 1895, when the two countries were entirely friendly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5790.051" offset="23263587">The -- this Court, however, went into a most detailed examination of the requirements of re -- of comity, insofar as reciprocity was concerned, and established that our courts would function -- would accord the nationals of foreign sovereigns only the rights that those foreign sovereigns accorded our nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.746" offset="23382392">And, in that case, because the judgment of the Courts of France -- in that case, because it appeared that the law of France was that the Courts of France could revise -- could examine and revise court judgments of other countries, therefore, our courts could reexamine judgments of the Courts of France.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.993" offset="23483329">Now, there has been a very recent decision by the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit, P&amp;E Shipping Corporation against Banco Exterior, another Cuban litigation, in which the Court of Appeals, of its own motion, raised this question and remanded the case to the district judge to make findings as to whether or not nationals of the United States could get justice in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.485" offset="23593357">And, pursuant to the mandate of the Court, in fact, the Court instructed the district judge to inquire from the Department of State, which he did, and the Department of State wrote a letter to the district Judge, which is Appendix B to my main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.023" offset="23679457">And, in that letter from the Department of State to the district judge, the Department said that there had been a breakdown in the Cuban judiciary as an independent branch of the Cuban Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.333" offset="23736717">But the Cuban judiciary was now subservient to the present political policies of the Cuban Executive and that the Department had concluded that even if legal remedies theoretically existed under Cuban law, recourse by a United States national to those remedies would be futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.041" offset="23827519">Now, I learned for the first time when I received Mr. Rabinowitz's reply brief on Thursday that, in this proceeding, Mr. Rabinowitz, on behalf of Cuba, had submitted affidavits that claimed to show that United States nationals could have recourse and could receive fair treatment in the Cuban courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.210" offset="23920201">I have examined those affidavits and, all I can say -- they are too detailed to review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5962.274" offset="23952488">All I can say is, after examining those affidavits, that I profoundly disagree with Mr. Rabinowitz's characterization of that, and I would suggest that if a court is not satisfied with the report of the Department of State as to judicial conditions in Cuba, that it do what the, and it regards this issue as determinative of the question of comity, that it remand this case to the District Court for findings in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.173" offset="24092087">Now, I come to my secondly proposition and that is this, that whether or not Cuba is entitled to comity, Cuba may not prosecute this action because known foreign sovereign may enforce its public laws in the course of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.742" offset="24170350">In fact, the rule is universal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.128" offset="24175888">No -- the Courts of no sovereign will entertain suits by other sovereigns for enforcement of their public laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.836" offset="24206712">Now, there has been a great deal of reference here to the so-called Act the state doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.389" offset="24232939">There is an equally well-settled Act of state doctrine which I invoke and, that is, that although the Courts will not undue the acts of state in a foreign power, neither will they enforce those acts of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.113" offset="24291871">Now, as I understand Mr. Katzenbach's distinction of this rule, which he seems to admit thoroughly, in fact, if my recollection is correct, he used the expression “hundreds of times” the Courts have laid down this rule, his dis -- his -- he distinguishes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6063.835" offset="24358745">He distinguishes this case on the ground that, as in a general way or they -- more often, it's more frequent that the question of the act of state comes up the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.793" offset="24410572">That is to say, it comes up as a defensive matter between private parties, so to speak, rather than as a suit by the foreign sovereign to enforce that act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6089.778" offset="24462503">Well, I respectfully suggest that that argument is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.230" offset="24496253">Of course the Court here is dealing with this case, not some theoretical case or not some usual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.732" offset="24526346">It's dealing with what happens here and my learned friends have sug -- cited no case whatsoever in which a foreign sovereign was held entitled to enforce an act of state, directly or indirectly, in the Courts of another sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.160" offset="24596041">I won't -- I won't go through the -- through the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6128.570" offset="24617671">Apparently, they -- it is conceded that they are applicable and, the only distinction is made, that it is more likely that the question arise because a man is defending on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.838" offset="24682768">It's putting up the defendant who is pleading the act of state rather than the foreign sovereign involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.670" offset="24718085">Of course, as I say here, we are dealing with a case where the foreign sovereign is asserting the act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.686" offset="24746088">And this Court, in Guaranty Trust Company against the United States, was most emphatic in drawing a distinction between those cases in which the act of a foreign sovereign might come up in the course of a litigation, let us say, between private parties and a case in which that foreign sovereign, itself, was seeking to enforce its public laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="6559.777" offset="26342484">Because they didn't involve sover -- foreign sovereign seeking to enforce acts of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6563.569" offset="26357635">Those were cases -- and this is an interesting distinction made by a number of the cases, in particular, an opinion of Judge Learned Hand in Moore against Mitchell and a very persuasive and, indeed, eloquent opinion by Justice Kingsmill Moore in Peter Buchanan Ltd. against McVey.</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.755" offset="26430360">The reason given for refusing to entertain efforts by foreign sovereigns to enforce their public laws in these two opinions is this, that always there is open to the Court of the forum the consideration of whether or not the contract or law, whatever it may be, is consistent with the public policy of the forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="6604.666" offset="26521997">Now, in private litigation, a court can determine that a particular act of state of a foreign sovereign is not consistent with a public policy or a particular law of the foreign sovereign is not consistent with its public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.090" offset="26579780">But, in litigation brought up by a foreign sovereign, it is embarrassing to international relations for a court to have to say "we don't like this law."</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.502" offset="26629413">And, Justice Moore points out that many of the laws of today may be shocking to the conscience of the forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="6646.242" offset="26688345">The party says, such laws meaning public laws, have been used for racial and religious discriminations, for the furtherance of social policies and ideals dangerous to the security of adjacent countries, and for the direct furtherance of economic warfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.754" offset="26746337">Now, it says the forum must always reserve the right to declare a particular law or Act contrary to its public policy and it embarrasses -- it is embarrassing to make that finding in a case in which the foreign government, itself, sues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6679.092" offset="26819688">Now, in other -- in other words --</text>

            <text syncTime="6718.451" offset="26977155">My learned friends, in their briefs, seem to take the position that the Courts, in order to keep foreign relations in a friendly way, must always enforce their acts of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6732.045" offset="27031594">What was held in Moore against Mitchell, and Peter Buchanan Ltd., and similar cases, is that because policy is involved, therefore, the Court should never entertain actions by foreign sovereigns involving public laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="6749.051" offset="27099617">Your Honor, I've completed my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6750.666" offset="27105991">I received, as I think I have said, Mr. Rabinowitz's learned reply brief on Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.281" offset="27132531">As a result of which, I revised to some extent my position, my views, on the subject of friendliness and comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6765.931" offset="27167117">I have a rebuttal brief here already printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.550" offset="27177566">It's only five pages long and I've given copies of it to Mr. Rabinowitz, Mr. Katzenbach, and Mr. Seymour.</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="6786.555" offset="27249560">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.892" offset="27262934">With only a couple of minutes, I will, first, say a word about the motion for substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6796.788" offset="27290520">There is, pending before the Court, a motion by C.A.V., my client, to be substituted for Sabbatino, the discharged state court receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="6807.950" offset="27335137">Sabbatino was appointed in 1960 as the State court receiver of the assets of C.A.V.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.696" offset="27366170">He received the funds which is in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6820.244" offset="27384351">At the end of 1962, he was discharged as state court receiver and that fund was placed in escrow abiding the event of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.883" offset="27422908">Therefore, Sabbatino has no further interest in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.605" offset="27445791">Mr. Williams filed as an indemnity, which is reflected in the record, and C.A.V. is the only party really in a position to assert an economic interest in the fund and, under the general power of the Court to grant substitutions in such cases, we would hope that the Court would do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.434" offset="27529070">The only argument on the other side is that these were an application on this Rule 24 (c), which it isn't, and if it were made in a different court, which it's not, there would be problems but it isn't that kind of an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.810" offset="27582568">It isn't made in a court to which the rules apply and, therefore, we would Your Honors would grant the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.881" offset="27610885">Now, on the merits, I would like to discuss the proposition, first, that the Act of state doctrine ought not to be applied where there is a clear violation of international law, and I recognize that there are dicta, which I shall have to work my way around, which would be interposed to such a proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6904.174" offset="27720077">But, those dicta originated at a period when international law did not bulk as large in the views of the American Government or the people of the world or the lawyers or judges of the world as they do now, and I would hope that international law now occupied a place where weighing the complications, some of which, I think are rather exaggerated, suggested by my distinguished friend, the Deputy Attorney General, against the importance of building support for international law, case by case, by courts like the United States courts that are followed all over the world, is far more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="6946.365" offset="27888828">And, I shall address myself, first, to that tomorrow, and then, at the end, I shall like to say a word about the public policy of New York which is involved here because this is a diversity case and, although the District Court didn't seem to take the point, there is a strong point on the public policy of New York which I'd like to present to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.914" offset="27979003">But, my main emphasis will be on the international law point, that I think the significance of that point is emphasized by the fact that Your Honors have before you briefs presented with great spirit and earnestness on behalf of the Association of the Bar, and the American Bar Association, and the International Law Association, and the Dean of the American Bar, Mr. John Lord O'Brian, and his partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6998.490" offset="28097285">And, these all emphasize the importance of the international law aspect of this and, weighing that against what is admitted to be a judge-made rule which the Court can administer as it thinks wisest in the long-range interest of the law of the United States and of the judicial administration of the United States, these indicate that international law should give -- be given great weight in the balance.</text>
