            <text syncTime="16.508" offset="171405">When the Court adjourned for the afternoon recess yesterday, I believe I was attempting to acquaint the Court with some of the gross discrepancies in the representation now provided in the Maryland State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.353" offset="222814">For example, it is now possible for approximately 14% of the people in the less populous counties to elect the majority of the Maryland State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.504" offset="267431">This was not always so.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.336" offset="274745">The careful research here by the Solicitor General and his staff has revealed that in 1790, for instance, it took at least 40% to elect the majority of the Maryland State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.047" offset="321557">This percentage has dwindled steadily through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.259" offset="334409">In 1937, it's about 18%.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.136" offset="346008">As I said, it's now about 14%.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.793" offset="356561">If the population projections are anywhere near accurate by 1970, it will be 12%.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.789" offset="572541">I think up until the temporary reapportioning of the House of Delegates, it was only Delaware and Maryland where the representation in both houses, Senate and House, were riveted, frozen in perpetuum into the constitution with no chance, and I'll come to that in a minute, of unhinging except the federal court in Sincock v.

            <text syncTime="139.191" offset="662194">What do you think would be a permissible percent of deviation, equality of representation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alfred_l_scanlan" startTime="146.036" stopTime="555.478">
            <label>Mr. Alfred L. Scanlan</label>
            <text syncTime="146.036" offset="689570">I would say this, Mr. Justice Harlan. I think that one house, we're completely based on population, which is not the Maryland situation now like they say we have conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.733" offset="728336">The New Jersey Attorney General says for the purposes of this case, we have conceded that the House is based on population.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.462" offset="759265">That would be like conceding that the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, that Jupiter and the moon are equidistant from the Earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.396" offset="791030">The fact is right now in the House of Delegates, the disparities were large, six to one, and even now 36% of the population could elect the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.641" offset="823944">But assuming arguendo that the House of Delegates of Maryland were based squarely on population, I would say that we would start out with the standards that I think should be applicable, equality of suffrage, but it might be possible -- it might be possible in order to recognize the county as an instrumentality to provide a minimum representation in the State Senate where each county had one provided that the numbers of the Senate were expanding so that additional senators could be given to the suburban counties like they were given to Baltimore, there's ample precedents in Maryland's history.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.454" offset="971274">They were given to Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.174" offset="978066">If the suburban counties were treated as fairly as Baltimore has been treated -- now Baltimore's population is declining and they're almost fairly represented in the Senate, not quite but almost, if we were treated as fairly as they, I would say the argument would be pretty good that the -- that the legislature had done all that the Constitution requires of them, but we're a long way from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.994" offset="1073361">But there is a precedent for that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.094" offset="1085795">I will say speaking of the disparities in the Maryland Senate and referring to what Justice Clark has called the crazy quilt approach and what the Solicitor General on occasion has referred to without rhyme or reason, not only do we have gross disparities between the urban and suburban counties, the more populous counties and areas in the City of Baltimore, but we have even within the classes disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.682" offset="1184120">For instance, Baltimore with approximately 950,000 people has six senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.197" offset="1210243">A Baltimore County right next to it with over 500,000 now, very closely related to the City of Baltimore, Annapolis etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.872" offset="1240858">500,000 people, one senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.038" offset="1253606">The senator from Baltimore County is elected by more people than it takes to elect the majority of the Maryland State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.730" offset="1284326">And I want at this point maybe to dispose of this nonsense about accessibility as a ground for deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.408" offset="1311075">Do you really think that the senator from Baltimore County representing 500,000 people is more accessible to its constituents than the senator from Calvert representing 16,000?</text>
            <text syncTime="314.253" offset="1362484">I suggest that the senator from Calvert has much more accessibility to his constituents than the senator from Baltimore County or the senator from Los Angeles County, five million.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.473" offset="1407310">He's accessible, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.336" offset="1414729">But I guess I better not press this argument too far because they'll turn it around and say because the rural senators know the interest of their constituents better, this is a factor that can be taken into consideration in granting them more representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.171" offset="1474079">They have a cork for every hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.361" offset="1490902">Now, as far as the Senate is concerned, and I'll deal with the whole House a little later, surely we have what Justice Clark said were incommensurables of both magnitude and frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.395" offset="1554954">From the point of view of what Justice Stewart has referred to as the simple arithmetic, we are in dire stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.583" offset="1583794">But Justice Stewart is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.109" offset="1593825">There's more to it than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.435" offset="1603124">There's more to it than arithmetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.510" offset="1615454">And we believe that malapportionment on the gross scale, which now exists in Maryland, has very practical, adverse consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.248" offset="1658399">It's not only an exercise in abstract injustice or mathematical inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.448" offset="1683163">There's a great deal more to it than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.298" offset="1694657">A number of years ago, Mr. Lewis down there and a pioneer law review article cataloged the adverse practical effects of long continued malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.184" offset="1738125">Since then, other scholars, other lawyers with briefs filed with this Court, in Baker v. Carr, and in some of the cases before you today have done it on a general basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.281" offset="1778563">But I can truthfully say that in Maryland, the record in this case shows adverse, harmful effects flowing from the gross malapportionment about which we now complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.788" offset="1836554">I believe that was Professor McKay and Mr. Pfeiffer in the brief amicus curiae filed on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union in this case that cataloged -- there are listed four categories of harm that flow from gross malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.410" offset="1903010">The first of course and the most paramount is the dilution of the vote, the harm to the voter himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.598" offset="1935820">Certainly we have that in Maryland and then we have it in the second aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.146" offset="1950030">In Maryland, a lot of money comes back from the state to the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.577" offset="1971764">Especially important is this in regard to our education system.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.738" offset="1988378">This money is returned to the local political subdivisions under various equalization formulae.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.277" offset="2014501">Now these formulae have been put in the statutes by the controlling body, which of course are the representatives and the senators from the less populous counties, and this has resulted over the years in a very small -- much smaller percentage of the money coming back to the big counties than they should be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.242" offset="2094435">And this is important especially in education where we're struggling in Montgomery County, and I'm sure the same is true in Baltimore County and in Prince George's, and perhaps very shortly in Anne Arundel.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.874" offset="2140933">And it has that therefore a practical adverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.249" offset="2154412">The second category of harm which the American Civil Liberties' brief refers to is the neglect of urban and suburban needs, and I think I've touched upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.320" offset="2198716">I think the record shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.872" offset="2208956">For instance, at the last session of the General Assembly, there was a bill proposed, it passed the House a substantial majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.139" offset="2245945">And this bill whatever changed the return of money for education, based it on number of pupils and would have been a considerable benefit to the suburban counties, and all their representatives in the House of Delegates voted substantially for it and passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.953" offset="2309266">It was of course a beating down in the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.887" offset="2416995">The third category of harm to which they refer is the so-called legislative stalemate and I think I won't delay on that, but if our brief at pages 61 through 64 summarizes a classic example of legislative stalemate such as it took place at the last set of the Maryland General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.129" offset="2501945">On the one hand, a House of Delegates, at least related to population, at least a substantial majority of the population had bare majority control.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.756" offset="2536427">It didn't have enough to push through a Constitutional Amendment but at least they had a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.637" offset="2555967">And on the other side, a Senate completely dominated by the less populous interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.479" offset="2575297">They were logged against the whole session and out of ten important pieces of legislation that we referred to in our brief, seven of them broke down in deadlock, so we have that category of harm in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.539" offset="2627542">The fourth category of harm is the tenancy if the urban and suburban needs are left unmet of those people that go somewhere and that go to the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.111" offset="4813887">As a matter of fact, there was nothing said about in the unit rule case prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.313" offset="4830710">There was no direct case authority except the voting right cases for the decision reached there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.715" offset="4856310">But the Court took into account the broad general constitutional purposes of analogous amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.306" offset="4882641">Many years ago, Chief Justice Stone, when he was dean at Columbia, complained that courts were quite willing to approach a new situation and analogize from cases decided prior to that time but were very reluctant to do it with respect to statutes and constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.063" offset="4961635">Statutes and even more so it seems to me constitutional provisions are a declaration not only of what is law in the past but they supply a premise for analysis when a new situation arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.385" offset="5014925">Now in the past, the discrepancies among the states up until the day of the 1900's were perhaps not too significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.126" offset="5045959">But when they reach the point of gross absurdity as they have today and certainly in Maryland's case, if Maryland's case satisfies the Fourteenth Amendment, anything satisfies the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.427" offset="5327141">I think -- say when Montana was admitted to the Union, I -- I do believe they had something like a federal plan there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.074" offset="5349710">And I think at that time, the disbursements of population and the very thin population of Montana would produce a result where a federal plan in the unitary state would not be particularly offensive, not resolve any gross disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.080" offset="5413763">As I here I think -- oh, one point I'd like to make, and it's made in our briefs but I won't belabor it, we have absolutely no chance for a relief at the hands in the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.722" offset="5452319">The whole history of Maryland is a proof of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.580" offset="5463709">The only time they did reapportion voluntarily was with respect to Baltimore on three different occasions that I've mentioned yesterday and the other last occasion was the Special Session that took place after Judge Duckett had struck down the representation provided in the House of Delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.564" offset="5535702">It establishes however that when you do have a controlling court decision, you can be reasonably sure that the legislature will act and I think not only this case but most of what's happened since this Court's decision in Baker v. Carr is proof of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.046" offset="5617622">Now, I want to say in passing, Maryland does not have the initiative, does not have the referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.668" offset="5644058">There is a provision in the Maryland Constitution for a constitutional convention every 20 years and dutifully the vote has held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.374" offset="5690870">I think a majority of the voters approved it in 1930 but a very substantial majority of those voting under question approved it in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.052" offset="5725665">Well, no convention has ever been called despite the fact that over a dozen bills have been introduced to the House and -- I mean in the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.532" offset="5759519">Many of these bills have passed the House incidentally where the least population is given some sort of a fair shake but they're killed in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.289" offset="5794628">Of course, I don't think there's any secret about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.382" offset="5806958">There are some that I know, some Senators from the rural counties are quite interested in constitutional reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.316" offset="5830677">We haven't had a major overhaul of the Maryland Constitution since 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.547" offset="5851575">Since that time, we've had 111 amendments who voted to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.183" offset="5866203">It's a hodgepodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.615" offset="5871846">It's a very difficult constitution to deal with like many State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.616" offset="5887833">And there's only one reason they don't call the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.163" offset="5898073">It's not that they're particularly against constitutional reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.192" offset="5910194">They're afraid that the convention might do something about the reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.807" offset="5928688">I don't think they need to be too afraid because if the constitution -- the constitutional convention would convene, the representation in it would be the same as now exist in the General Assembly and the less populous areas would dominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.487" offset="5983336">As a matter of fact, it recalls to my New Jersey's experience, and I'm sure Mr. Justice Brennan is familiar with that when New Jersey finally achieved its great constitutional reform after a hundred more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.262" offset="6030461">It only did so by agreeing in the call to the Convention -- for the Convention that the Convention could not meddle with change or alter the representation provided in the New Jersey General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.587" offset="6083751">Now, I think that we have made out a prima facie case for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to the representation that's provided in the Maryland State Senate and for that matter in the General Assembly as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.304" offset="6150625">But before we could say that with any self-assurance, I think we ought to deal with the burden of proof that's put upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.956" offset="6181240">I agree and the Assistant Solicitor General from New York yesterday made much of the point that there's a presumption of constitutionality that kept coming back to Mr. Chief Justice Warren's statement to that effect in McGowan v. Maryland and no one disputes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.975" offset="6249368">But surely side by side with that elementary principle of how this Court decides constitutional cases, there seem to be another well-established doctrine that -- where fundamental liberties are involved, civil liberties if you want to call them that, or political liberties, the right of free speech, the right to free exercise of religion, the right to freedom of assembly, and I would think the right of suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.191" offset="6362216">The right to be fairly and equally represented comes within that line of cases that began, I suppose, or maybe didn't begin but are referred to in the famous Footnote 4 by Chief Justice Stone in the Carolene Products case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.742" offset="6420417">It seems to me if this Court is going to view with a dim light eye, legislation that attempts to impair the right of free speech of an extremist agitator where the right to free exercise of dissident, non-theist group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.593" offset="6479768">It seems to me that the right of suffrage when the claim is made is being denied thousands of citizens in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.862" offset="6512891">But then the standard of this Court is to apply is one of the careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.938" offset="6533162">I won't say the presumption is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.856" offset="6540894">Presumption of constitutionality may still be there, but this Court approaches those cases with a slightly different point of view that it does with mere economic regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.995" offset="6581436">And as far as the right of suffrage is concerned, one of the most famous cases that ever reached this Court of another matter, Yick Wo versus Hopkins which annunciated the principles of equal protection that live in the law to this day and we hope forever, they're indicted as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.852" offset="6644861">The Court remarked that the right of suffrage was the most fundamental because it was preservative of all the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.417" offset="6671088">In the end, no matter what this Court says or does, in the end, it is the people in their legislative body, congress or the states that will decide the fate of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.383" offset="6718945">And therefore, it seems to me that this Court has a special obligation to see to it that if the people are going to decide monumental questions of state and federal affairs that the mechanism of government isn't perpetually rigged in favor to some and against others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.182" offset="6786132">So I think then as far as the burden of proof is concerned, we can say that we have established the prima facie case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.772" offset="12340496">We want to encourage the pastoral life that it rests on the proposition that in this area, ours is a society that does not permit political classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.206" offset="12394203">Now I come and presume that we have exactly the same figures in this state with respect to the number of senators, four for each of the three pastoral counties and one for the factory area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.252" offset="12458465">And in other words, the waiting exactly corresponds to that of governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.718" offset="12476332">I submit to you that the reason that was applicable in the governor case is equally applicable in the Senate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.479" offset="12511336">It is this that I had in mind when I said that I thought to that extent and with reference only to that extent that Mr. Justice Harlan was right in his dissenting opinion in Baker and Sanders when he said these are the same things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.072" offset="12565671">If you are going to admit this range of considerations to enter into the rule of constitutional determination, I see no way of distinguishing between the choice of the legislature and the choice of the governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.318" offset="12634739">It seems to me it's just as irrelevant as it is the Attorney General argued that case and I'm arguing this one, or that that case came from Georgia and this present one comes from Maryland, or the same thing -- I won't go through all the figures -- the same thing applies to the choice of the assembly, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.835" offset="12712793">Now where the difference seems to me to come, as I said, I think the case is dispositive on that proposition where the difference seems to me to come is that there are elements that may enter into the choice of a legislature which by hypothesis don't come in when you're selecting one man for a single constituency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.502" offset="12807461">One of those elements may be that I think I suggested before that you may have an island off the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.340" offset="12834732">This was a case with Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.110" offset="12849883">And you want to have somebody there who knows something about the needs of the people on that island or somebody from the upper peninsula of Michigan who knows something about it, whereas those people would be because of the difficulties of communication, transportation, time and so forth largely unrepresented unless you brought someone in to the extent that one is concerned in apportionment With that kind of question, there I would agree that Gray and Sanders is not logically dispositive and I take it, although of course I have no way of knowing, that it is that kind of difference that the court must have had in mind when it said that the one case didn't decide the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.977" offset="13029292">I don't believe it was saying while you can't create preferred political classes in selecting a governor, you can have preferred political classes in selecting a legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="4032.539" offset="16235562">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.839" offset="16248728">I would like as I open to call the Court's attention to a development in the State of Maryland within the last 14 days, which conceivably could have some bearing on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.891" offset="16288956">Certainly it's in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.612" offset="16299823">Exactly two weeks ago today, Judge Barnes, a judge of the Baltimore City Supreme Bench, a bench which has general equity power struck down in Baltimore City, the districting laws which had obtained there since 1922, as Mr. Scanlan touch upon the subject, the Baltimore City situation is there so that it has six districts and each of which is a state senator, a prior to the 1962 so-called Stopgap Legislation and had 36 representatives or the members of the House of Delegates, six from each district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.224" offset="16430331">Following that Stopgap Legislation, the third district was given two additional delegates and the Fifth District was given one additional delegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.590" offset="16463768">And I'd like to, if I might, because I'm probably buying some trouble by doing it, but that I call to the Court the population disparity which existed in the Baltimore City legislative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.850" offset="16504832">The First District had a population of 94,761.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.698" offset="16524163">The Second District had a population of 84,213.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.197" offset="16542239">The Third District had a population of 278,759.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.662" offset="16568048">Fourth District had 118,339.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.978" offset="16581319">The Fifth had 223,417.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.857" offset="16596888">The Sixth District had 139,539.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.774" offset="16612561">The Court struck the districting down on the basis of the same portion of the constitution which is in question here relating to Baltimore City and that specifically requires that the district shall be set up contiguous and as -- as much equal on population as could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.314" offset="16686644">When this case was filed, the Attorney General of Maryland -- I didn't get in the case, but the Attorney General came in and stipulated that the -- quite obviously that population disparities which existed in this case were sufficient to violate the state constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.036" offset="16745576">On that basis now, we have -- well, we haven't had a decree in that case and -- and I don't know what the decree will say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.183" offset="16770132">We have a situation where we have a formless Baltimore City in relation to these legislative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.616" offset="16795836">I would certify to the Court in this respect that the state has no intention of appealing at least on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.258" offset="16818406">I don't know whether the Court will get into -- whether all of these people must run it large because it's at least questionable whether they may under the Court of Appeals' first decision in the initial reapportionment case which is in this record and which followed Baker versus Carr and -- and annunciated the principles in Baker.</text>

            <text syncTime="4606.853" offset="18532874">It was founded in 1650. It's always had the same general type of representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4616.138" offset="18569968">Baltimore City perhaps is in a different posture because you have to stop the city limit somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.807" offset="18592643">In other words, the state chose to -- to form a city in that -- at that point and -- and at that point, the -- the criteria applicable to the City of Baltimore perhaps became somewhat different from the criteria which might be applied to the county because the County of Baltimore is partly -- I'd say partly heavily industrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.373" offset="18670905">We've got the Martin plant and the Bethlehem Steel interest at -- at one end of the county, in the far end of the county (Inaudible) Towson.</text>

            <text syncTime="4684.075" offset="18841746">It was for the first county that was formed in 1637 and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.935" offset="18861181">We have -- we have 23 counties in the State of Maryland in the -- in the city of Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.928" offset="18877168">By the constitutional convention of 1776, of course the state was formed some short well before the formation of the federal union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.497" offset="18911441">At that time, state senators for example were elected by an indirect method.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.526" offset="18931503">This continued up until 1837 and included within that indirect method of election, votes were given to the town of Baltimore and to the town of Annapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.741" offset="18976434">Now in 1837, the situation changed somewhat and each of these counties were given directly a senator and Baltimore town was also given a senator.</text>

            <text syncTime="4736.439" offset="19051144">So at that time, each county had representation of one senator in Baltimore City.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.257" offset="19070474">In the -- under the Constitution of 1864 and 1867, the Constitutional Conventions, the situation changed somewhat with reference to Baltimore City.</text>

            <text syncTime="4754.167" offset="19122092">This was right of course at the time of the Civil War and at that time, certain of the Southern Maryland counties had sympathized with the confederacy and it was thought that to give additional representation to Baltimore City would, to an extent, wait that situation which existed in Southern Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.963" offset="19197221">In 1900, an additional district was created in Baltimore City which gave Baltimore City four districts and four state senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.733" offset="19228359">In 1922, it was added to -- to give Baltimore City two additional state senators so that by 1922, Baltimore City had six state senators and in the -- and it had from six legislative districts and -- and of course representatives or the members from the House of Delegates in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.621" offset="19315921">Now, appellant has made some point that population has always been a consideration in the composition of the Maryland state senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.159" offset="19346014">We dispute that if -- if only on the statistics because in 1920 when Baltimore City had 51% of the state's population, it had 4 of 27 state senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.096" offset="19393766">It receded population, may it please the Court, despite -- and received its representation despite its population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.122" offset="19421874">And so, the Balt -- and so the present districting setup in the Maryland state senate hasn't been touched since that time in 1922, so we come to this Court with 23 counties, each having one senator and Baltimore City with its six from the districts up until Judge Barne's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="5003.461" offset="20119239">This resulted from the loss of certain wartime type industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.722" offset="20132300">It became highly depressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.860" offset="20140868">Allegany County at this time is a depressed area and as I say, Washington County became so depressed that it -- it had to go to the federal government of course for help as it did to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.820" offset="20180679">It was -- it was in bad shape.</text>

            <text syncTime="5022.893" offset="20196979">It's on the little boot of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.090" offset="20205756">It's -- it's quite different from the rest of the state and to an extent, it is also a depressed area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.854" offset="20228848">Allegany and Garrett County have strip mining interest with which Baltimore citizens or even citizens of Hagerstown or Washington County couldn't care less.</text>

            <text syncTime="5044.770" offset="20284541">In addition, Garrett County is trying to develop a -- a recreation type community where -- where people can go during the summer and the winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.383" offset="20326964">Now, having set up that -- that context, we say that we have -- we have the same representation unquestionably from Garrett County in the state senate and from Kent County as we do from Baltimore County that is the basic unit of one senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.250" offset="20390390">Now, in getting into what I'd thought would be my form of my argument, I would like to go to the basic questions which we think are involved in this case, actually the basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.549" offset="20435634">We think the -- the only question before this Court is a question of the makeup of the Maryland state senate and -- and we say this for several reasons, one of which is that the stopgap legislation, which was passed and which as we've indicated in our brief, is certainly not perfect apportionment according to population in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.121" offset="20513896">Nonetheless, it's the type of apportionment that even appellants at the time when they were speaking a little more freely agreed would satisfy them for the time being.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.700" offset="20552244">It was called stopgap legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.887" offset="20564992">Now, neither the Lower Court, that is the court in Anne Arundel County, the equity Judge nor the Court of Appeals decided the point of whether the whole legislature ought to be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.072" offset="20609714">We submit that point is not before this Court for a couple of additional reasons, that one of which is the so-called stopgap legislation as we pointed out in the footnote in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.628" offset="20651928">It was litigated in independent litigation in the Calvert County Circuit Court and it was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.780" offset="20676587">Its constitutionality was sustained and it was never appealed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.774" offset="20692470">And further, we -- we have serious doubt whether -- whether this Court at this time should consider the present population under the stopgap system for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.543" offset="20743565">The -- the trial court proceeded in -- in other words, a long jump was taken forward in the question of population according -- representation according to population in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.073" offset="20781704">If this Court intervenes at this point in that -- in that item, we say that it's -- it's not in the spirit of the pace at which perhaps apportioning matters ought to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.792" offset="20820574">For example, in some of the three-judge federal courts, I think Alabama is a case, the Court -- these courts have been quite frank in stating that the apportionment plan which was then under consideration didn't meet all the criteria that they would wish of apportionment plans but that it was a step forward, that it would do for a time being, and we say that that's the kind of apportionment with -- that we now have in the Maryland House of Delegates, far from perfect but -- but the -- the march is on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.287" offset="20938543">We think we'll get -- I believe we'll get apportionment according to population, perhaps strictly so in the Maryland House of Delegates, although we don't have it now.</text>

            <text syncTime="5259.567" offset="21143656">Now, I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter perhaps went to the heart of this question in his -- in his dissent in this Baker versus Carr, and I'm not trying to reargue Baker v. Carr but he said that before we top off the debasement or dilution of the right to vote, we ought to talk about what a man's vote is worth in the context of -- of -- of our institutions and the context of our constitution which we're holding up as the absolute yardstick.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.946" offset="21261208">And I would be frank to say that I know this Court wants help on the question of standards but I don't think it's gotten much help to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.354" offset="21298824">That standard is so difficult to apply when looking at the -- at the various institutions, the state institutions that -- that are called into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.702" offset="21332261">It's -- it's an enormous job to establish standards which -- which can be readily or -- or somewhat readily applied to all the varying circumstances in the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="5327.156" offset="21414076">We say that tied up with -- with this thing is the basic question of representative government and -- and I'm frank to -- to observe that I don't think any of the -- especially the consensus of courts that Mr. (Inaudible) cited here two days ago, I don't think that those courts have gotten into the basic question, the basic problem of representative government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.334" offset="21506759">That is to say if -- if we have a right here, which this Court has -- has -- the Court has said there is a right that we have to -- to consider in context with that right, with that right which the plaintiff must articulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.490" offset="21555346">We've got to talk about what we ought to have in state government, what we ought to have in state legislatures in reference to the vote because appellants -- the appellants registered, appellants voted, they had their votes counted but what they're complaining about is that the time their state senators stepped into the -- into the State House, it became smaller in stature because of this dilution of their vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.008" offset="21661403">Now, certainly it ought to be observed that before the -- before a comment can be made upon the makeup of the state representative system, and we're really talking -- when we talk about the state, we're talking about the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.429" offset="21723157">We've got to talk about what makes the legislature go.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.776" offset="21732561">When (Inaudible) goes to the legislature, what makes him run when he's a -- a delegate or a senator?</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.911" offset="21753041">We say that the Courts have not gone into any of the criteria that -- that -- that are quite obviously there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.442" offset="21783239">For example, well, I've never served in the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.082" offset="21797763">I've been there many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.222" offset="21802360">I've worked there eight or nine sessions and I know that there are far more important items in consideration of even a single piece of legislation and simply to -- in other words, what I'm -- what I'm getting at is that the Court can take your Fourteenth Amendment even as -- as flexible and -- and as Lou says its standards may be and hold it against the state -- hold it against the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.609" offset="21883862">But until you talk about -- about the question of compromise, the part that compromise plays in any bill, on any legislative enactment, for example the -- the last bill that gave -- that created the constitutional memo to give Baltimore City two additional state senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.732" offset="21948332">What -- what was the reason for that?</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.840" offset="21956796">Well, the appellants -- the appellants have no trouble with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.445" offset="21967245">The Solicitor General has no trouble with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.237" offset="21974350">The standards are there, easily -- easily applied Fourteenth Amendment standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.563" offset="21995666">We submit that they're not so easily applied, that this situation that this Court has before it now doesn't lend itself readily to the -- to the adoption of -- of equal protection principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.638" offset="22048016">For example, the thing that -- that might have caused that bill to pass the legislature which gave Baltimore City two additional senators is politics, pure and simple, just a simple play of politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.602" offset="22099843">The compromise element was -- was apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.897" offset="22113008">The appellant say population played a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.968" offset="22121263">They're just saying that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.176" offset="22126174">The record is the void of -- of this -- of this fact, that it's a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.234" offset="22146341">There's no question Baltimore City had population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.161" offset="22158043">So when we get into the representative system, when we get into those state legislature, we're talking about the politics that control the situation, a party control talking about the compromise that's quite evident in any bill, talking about to use them (Inaudible) vote swapping.</text>
