            <text syncTime="86.368" offset="448867">(Inaudible)</text>

          <turn speaker="jerome_f_fallon" startTime="88.163" stopTime="643.433">
            <label>Mr. Jerome F. Fallon</label>
            <text syncTime="88.163" offset="455973">Yes, sir, except for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.063" offset="463600">We have these elongated slots which cast light upwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.805" offset="478542">So, ordinarily these would be bolted to the trusses, which are the cross A-shaped members that are in a factory so that there maybe 05 or 10 feet between the actual roof and the top of this housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.483" offset="533295">The components of the fixture include the housing, this rectangular shape portion which includes all of the wiring and the ballasts which are heavy transformers needed to spark the light tubes that are included down below.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.923" offset="587107">The light tubes are supported from socket portions which hang down from the housing and then sandwiched in between is the reflector portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.410" offset="625037">And it is this with which we are concerned primarily because all of the other elements are old or there are substantial differences between what Compco puts out and what the plaintiff below, the respondent here, Day-Brite has in their fixture.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.343" offset="688776">Now, the up-lighting fixtures of this type, having these slots became popular in the early 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.820" offset="730676">Shortly after that, they faced a problem in this art because the porcelain coating, this is like we find on sinks and bathtubs, this porcelain enamel, tended to chip and it was determined that the chipping occurred because of -- because the metal, the steel of this reflector, when it was heated during this enameling operation up to about 1600 degrees, tended to warp and twist so as to get out of alignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.078" offset="831718">And therefore, there were inbred strains, you might say, so that this fixture, when it was handled later on, would tend to chip, the porcelain enamel would pop off.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.248" offset="880410">This was solved by the respondent here, Day-Brite, by elongating these ribs so that they came down here to provide additional stiffness for this size, to make this -- to make the side stiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.799" offset="934536">In all other respects, the reflector is like the prior art that which preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.736" offset="954284">The prior art had the elongated slots.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.553" offset="965569">It had the ribs about this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.886" offset="974869">But in order to overcome this problem of porcelain chipping, especially along the sides, like these ribs, I beg your pardon, they look like grooves here.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.333" offset="1012694">They're ribs when you look at them from the underside.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.453" offset="1045191">These -- these ribs were extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.073" offset="1055640">Now, this gave the reflector the resistance that it needed and this point was very heavily emphasized by Day-Brite, the initiator of the elongated ribs.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.450" offset="1105168">We point out, in our brief, the feature of strength that was emphasized by Day-Brite.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.250" offset="1136410">On page 11 of our brief, we have this little folded in advertisement of Day-Brite where they show a 358-pound man seated on one of these, showing how stiff and how strong they really are, emphasizing in bold letters the strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.811" offset="1194611">Quite rightly, Day-Brite filed a mechanical patent application on this because this is a functional or a mechanical improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.733" offset="1222301">They filed this application.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.632" offset="1229928">It went all the way to the Patent Office and to the Patent Office Board of Appeals and it was turned down because the Patent Office held that this was an obvious expedient, the normal thing someone would do if they wanted to increase the strength of a reflector.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.826" offset="1286666">A common place example of the use of ribs is in corrugated paperboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.897" offset="1310908">It's very easy to fold paperboard that way, parallel with the length of the corrugations or ribs, but you have to practically crack it in order to fold it the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.413" offset="1353017">So, that was what was attempted to be done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.963" offset="1363257">There's one type of stiffness afforded by the slip and then the other type of stiffness can keep these sides from warping was provided by elongating these ribs from this point down to there.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.477" offset="1413308">However, Day-Brite was successful in the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.398" offset="1425011">They got a design patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.317" offset="1432639">A design patent in contrast to a mechanical patent has to do with the ornamental aspect, the beauty, the aesthetics, the flow of curves and lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.979" offset="1483316">This has to do with any industrial or commercial article.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.467" offset="1501288">Any article of manufacture can be design patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.362" offset="1512782">That includes a lighting fixture, a dress, a concrete mixer, anything that's got an aesthetic appearance, you -- you can design a patent, the nonfunctional or aesthetic features.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.386" offset="1564923">And they were successful in convincing the Patent Office that the reflector portion had this requisite ornamentation or distinctiveness as far as design is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.078" offset="1611734">Now, this is precisely -- this same aspect of ornamentation or distinctiveness in the aesthetic sense is precisely the same thing that's involved in unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.248" offset="1660322">In this case, that people have always been believed to or permitted to copy the functional aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.869" offset="1694804">The unfair competition law in the past said, "Well, there may be something wrong if you copy the nonfunctional or the aesthetic aspects because they serve to identify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.438" offset="1737122">You don't have to do that in order to get a better article."</text>
            <text syncTime="411.265" offset="1748407">However, the design patent was held invalid for two -- for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.878" offset="1766902">First of all, it was held non-inventive over what had gone before.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.727" offset="1782262">The Court said merely extending these ribs didn't add anything really inventive as far as design is concerned and here we should appreciate that a design patent has to meet the same standards of invention as a mechanical patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.060" offset="1839626">They're all in the same statute, both covered by the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.321" offset="1852688">There's a difference that the maximum term of a design patent is 14 years, whereas, the term of a mechanical patent is automatically 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.295" offset="1888528">So, they said that the Patent Office didn't have the best prior art before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.015" offset="1907440">It didn't have anything that showed slots and ribs, at least coming across this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.500" offset="1929383">So, when the court saw this better prior art, it said the design patent was invalid because the Patent Office hadn't seen the best prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.835" offset="1966686">The court also said that, clearly, the ribs are functional.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.430" offset="1981106">Therefore, you can't have a design patent on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.354" offset="2000750">Now Day-Brite, during the time that this patent was in effect, some five years or so, used this as a very effective sword.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.571" offset="2033664">They made at least nine rather modest sized competitors, either change their construction or go out of the business entirely, these competitors ranging from Long Island out to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.587" offset="2101687">And, about the only thing that was common are these competitors had variations in this design.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.278" offset="2124466">The one feature in common with all of them was the fact that they made use of this longer rib which was put in there for then purpose of strengthening.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.563" offset="2157589">As far as we're concerned, the fact that they carried on this extensive litigation program certainly confirms the fact that Day-Brite elected to get its coverage, its protection, its monopoly on this, if you please, through the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.541" offset="2221537">And the law, as we understand it, is that when a patent expires, either prematurely by virtue of invalidation or by virtue of running its term, that particular construction goes into the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.174" offset="2280051">That is the condition under which the patent is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.319" offset="2292694">The patent law specifies that there must be a complete disclosure, a full disclosure, just for the purpose so that at the end of the term, whether it's 14 years for a design patent or 17 years for a mechanical patent, that then the public who has given up this or given an individual this monopoly that then they could have the benefit of it and copy this.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.539" offset="2377540">And the design patent shows exactly what we have here, give or take some changes in dimensions and sizes of curves and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.052" offset="2419545">We also see that this matter of patents is exclusely -- exclusively within the federal domain, and it's set down right in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.070" offset="2471685">So, what we have here is, where a person who has a meritorious invention, where the patent has been able to run the full length, the most he can get is 17 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.468" offset="2517243">Here was an improvement not rising to the dignity of invention, yet, these people have a monopoly in perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.323" offset="2556635">So, it seems that the -- the lesser improvement merits the greater protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.806" offset="2586624">Day-Brite is attempting to recapture this monopoly that they lost with the District Court's invalidating this design patent under the guise of unfair competition and to stop Compco from making the precise thing that was dedicated to the public by virtue of the premature expiration of the design patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.882" offset="6278875">Counsel has alluded to the fact that the respondent herein has driven competitors out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.236" offset="6312312">Has used this as some sort of sword for a number of years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2580.555" offset="10425553">I think we're quite familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.902" offset="10430986">And I think the same thing will be true with regard to the new Michelob bottle of beer which is very, very distinctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.364" offset="10464841">And I'm certain there's no design patent on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.141" offset="10475917">The very fact that a design patent, that the practitioner to whom this manufacture went to and said, "Now, how can I protect my product?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.051" offset="10507577">He says, "You can go under the patent statute or you can do nothing because the patent is fraught with this question of what is invention?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.087" offset="10543731">And as Justice Jackson said in this Court in the Ausby case, "Only -- the only valid patent is a patent that the Supreme Court can't get its hands on."</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.678" offset="10586049">So, he has to counsel his manufacturing client and he said, "Let's go for a secondary meaning."</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.715" offset="10610186">Now, this is running pretty rampant through the bar as to what they should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.410" offset="10628995">It is a very serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.379" offset="10636936">This Court never had quite that problem in Mazer versus Stein but it had no hesitancy in stating that even though the lamp which was before it, which was utilitarian, which was ornamental, had both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.640" offset="10689912">It had the functional and the nonfunctional features.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.162" offset="10704018">It had no hesitancy in saying that even though you could've patent it, the fact that he proceeded under the copyright law and obtained his protection, we're not going to say that, because he went under one heading or one federal statute in lieu of another, that that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.273" offset="10772459">As a matter of fact, just recently after the Mazer versus Stein decision here and the Benarous case, a court in New York stated that counsel ought to be complemented upon seeking any type of protection he can on the theory that a court may knock down one and uphold the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.715" offset="10850200">Now, in patents, we have this question of always overcoming what is patentability, what is invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.489" offset="10877367">We do not have that in the copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.674" offset="10886040">All it has to do is be original.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.993" offset="10895339">In the area of unfair competition, we've got to show that it acquired a secondary meaning, which we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.353" offset="10924805">Now, there's one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.241" offset="10932328">Most of the cases in petitioner's brief deal only with the fact of expired patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.780" offset="10962526">That is, after the patentee has had his full monopoly under the patent, in this case 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.341" offset="10992724">We have never had that in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.264" offset="11004426">We haven't had the 14 years or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.090" offset="11015711">The constitution says it shall secure, not devest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.603" offset="11041834">In this case, and as far as our legal research has been able to ascertain, there has been only one case which has dealt with the difference between the expiration of a patent and a patent which has been judiciously declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.869" offset="11102856">Now, I might say that this patent is not a dead letter right today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.455" offset="11121142">It's only invalid insofar as the petitioner here is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.115" offset="11143816">And all that the court below -- it didn't say anything else as to anyone else, all that the court below has enjoined him from unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.332" offset="11176730">Now, the Government -- the Government had no problem saying that there was -- the federal patent supremacy law as contrast to the unfair competition because they said, in this particular case, although we have a companion case which follows immediately after, we were entitled under the findings of fact, in the court below, we are entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.447" offset="11277145">They only stated that we don't believe the relief should be as strong, though it should be less stringent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.403" offset="11300968">Now, in that regard, I don't have to remind the Court that the Court here does not sit in function to review findings of fact or the sufficiency of evidence in support of the findings and that's in Southern Power Company versus North Carolina Public Service Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.455" offset="11389158">The Government has suggested to this Court that it remand it so that this particular defendant-petitioner can sufficiently market so that the public will know what is the source of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.265" offset="11452479">To that, we answer, although we agree with the Governm -- the Government's petition in many respects, we do not believe with the relief or the remand that it suggests for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.656" offset="11505977">That he has, that is, the petitioner enjoyed for eight years his acts of unfair competition as found by the District Court and the three Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.592" offset="11541713">We do not believe that by merely labeling now in a proper manner, that he can dissipate the effects of the unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.878" offset="11578911">The law is repeat with -- replete with cases that say a wrongdoer is under a greater obligation than the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.677" offset="11622066">Now, I believe I mentioned to the Court very briefly that there is the only case that I know of that deals with the particular matter of an expired patent versus an unexpired patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.434" offset="11685073">And that is the Lucien Lelong case at 164 F.2d 395, cited at our -- only in respondent's brief in opposition at pages 7 and 8 where the court said, "If in return for the statutory monopoly or a term the patentee has held thereafter to dedicate his invention to the public, it would naturally follow that where he had never had this monopoly, he has nothing to give up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.459" offset="11801161">The situation is one where no patent has ever existed."</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.344" offset="11820701">That is the only pronouncement I can find as the difference between an expired patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.446" offset="11841181">That is, one that has run its full patent monopoly, its term 17 years with regard to a mechanical patent and 14 years with regard to a design patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.276" offset="11892485">Now, I suggest that what respondent has done here is merely follow the teaching that this Court laid down in Mazer versus Stein, a decision in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.731" offset="11942327">Namely, that we have elected two causes of action to protect our client's rights, namely, design patent infringement and unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.150" offset="12000005">Now, in the case of Mazer versus Stein, the Court had no problem of a monopoly, although it upheld the copyright there which is good for 28 years plus a renewal of 28 years versus a design patent of a maximum of 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.043" offset="12067506">So in that case, the Court upheld, in effect, a monopoly for 56 years versus the fact that he could've proceeded under another federal statute for a period of 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.169" offset="12120064">We are doing the same thing here only, instead of applying the copyright, we are applying unfair competition as pronounced by our Court of Appeals and the Illinois court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.747" offset="12170324">We can see that, in this respect, we are merely following the teaching what this Court has laid down and what I have cited from the Benarous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.781" offset="12214523">In conclusion, Your Honors, although the petitioner has raised the question that this violates the antitrust law, I submit, I -- I can't find nothing in the record to -- to so label this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.800" offset="12274604">It is a mere case of unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.165" offset="12288084">This gentleman decided to copy a product that had identification built into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.503" offset="12313370">A product which the court found as such and the Court of Appeals upheld and the fact that we did have a design patent momentarily and never enjoyed its full term has nothing at all to do with the count under unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.845" offset="12386722">We say we are following the teach -- teaching in Mazer versus Stein and that there is no conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.903" offset="12410964">Accordingly, we believe that the judgment below should be affirmed in view of this Court's pronouncement that it does not seek to set aside findings of fact where they have been concurred in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.917" offset="12463000">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>
