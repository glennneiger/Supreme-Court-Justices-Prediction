            <text syncTime="199.007" offset="901541">The questions that were asked of the petitioner were as follows For whom he worked on September 11, 1959, which happened to be the day of the raid?</text>

            <text syncTime="641.786" offset="2672643">Secondly, we assert that he could have been readily involved in a series of felonies for which there is a five-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.410" offset="2711096">And if he were engaged in a conspiracy to commit felonies, there is a 15-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.893" offset="2737009">And our contention is that the court erred, our State Court erred, when it said that he could not possibly incriminate himself because the statute of limitations had intervened.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.574" offset="2795732">Further that this being a constitutional question that if the Fifth -- sort of the Fourteenth is held to apply so that our court -- so that the State Court had to conform to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth, then the standard of constitutionality had to be the federal standards, as set forth in the Ker case and also perhaps in the Fahy versus Connecticut case, which was heard last December It's the federal standards when you reach a constitutional question that apply and those federal standards as they are demonstrated through the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.267" offset="2938570">In Connecticut, the Court used a standard that the judge in determining whether or not the questions were harmful could exercise reasonable judgment and that -- and he had to act as a reasonable person and reasonably conclude that the questions would be damaging to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.612" offset="3011922">Whereas in the federal cases such as in the Hoffman case, the Singleton case, the IUPA case and Mathy case and so forth, it's held that the standard that must be used is not the heavy strong standard of reasonableness, as whether or not in the context of the situation the width that can be concluded that the witness would incriminate himself by his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.143" offset="3126025">There is a substantially lesser standard that was to demonstrated that I think is early as in the Burt trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.836" offset="3152878">When Chief Justice Marshall said in effect that if the witness testifies, swears under oath, that the questions are incriminating, that is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.933" offset="3193211">And it's also in cases -- in the Hoffman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.928" offset="3209198">It says that if the witness is to try to explain why the questions will be damaging to him, he is exposing himself to the hazard that he is seeking to avoid, and that has been repeated, I think even in the Mathy case, which I think said that even the mere possibility that the questions, the answers to the questions will be incriminating, is sufficient to permit the witness the immunity of silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.229" offset="3338452">There is also of course, which I hadn't mentioned up to this point, the application of the Fourth Amendment through the Fourteenth to the states through the Wolf case, and Mapp case and the Ker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.921" offset="3397176">This is a case upon which, to be perfectly candid, we hope the premise our hope for a reversal of what is the common practice of the (Inaudible) with reference to the application of the Fifth Amendment to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.101" offset="3457884">In arriving at the conclusion that various aspects of the Bill of Rights do become applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, various formulas were devised and cited saying that the constitutional question that -- amendment that is in question applies to the states if it is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, if it is of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty, if it is a principle of justice so rooted in the tradition and conscience of our people as to be ranked to be fundamental, if it is -- and it applied this amendment in the Palko case or it mentioned this amendment, this formula in the Palko case as a policy of absorption that has its source and the belief that neither liberty nor justice could exist if they were sacrificed.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.513" offset="3699569">Another formula was that the constitutional provision is a fundamental principle of liberty and justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.634" offset="10867987">Therefore the test that our court applied here with respect to the burden on the petitioner to tell the court something about his fear is certainly understandable, because we haven't any way of getting any place in Connecticut in an investigating nature, if all he can do is say I assert my privilege and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.397" offset="10979060">Now that's conceivable -- it is conceivable for instance in another state where the immunity is granted and granted freely, all they have to do is if he asserts his privilege to grant him the immunity, then I -- how they do it in these other states I'm not certain, my understanding is that they are not concerned so much with any explanation under those circumstances as we might be in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.795" offset="11080624">But in Connecticut at least we ought to be told certainly by argument at least of counsel because that doesn't incriminate anyone, what the fear is and what crimes that he is worried about being prosecuted for.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold Strauch</label>
            <text syncTime="3514.963" offset="14165371">I think I have only a few minutes and I have several -- I think I have only a few minutes and I have several points I would like to get over very rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.061" offset="14193688">In connection with the question that was asked as to whether or not this was criminal or a civil contempt, I would like to point out that in the Boyd versus US case, the phrase -- it said that the phrase in the Fifth Amendment, "In any criminal case", includes civil matters and I think that's implied also in the Mapp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.976" offset="14277385">In connection, one thing I would like to emphasize as an important point of our case is that the lower court, the state court did not use the federal standards and perhaps this might help in explaining why I say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.937" offset="14337257">The lower court which heard the case before it went to Supreme Court said that the questions propounded to the petitioner do not indicate a danger to the petitioner of criminal liability, which is real and appreciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.974" offset="14393368">That is the test in the McCarthy case in Connecticut, in 110 Connecticut 482.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.384" offset="14446971">And our Supreme Court on page 21 I think it is of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.374" offset="14471004">No, our Supreme Court in its decision upheld the lower court and it upheld the lower court on the basis of the McCarthy case, and the McCarthy case is predicated upon an old English case known as Regina versus Boyes, Regina versus Boyes in B. &amp; S. 311 of 350, that the danger to the witness must be "real and appreciable", and the Regina and Boyes test was disavowed in Emspak versus United States case in 349 U.S. 190.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.874" offset="14628993">So that the State Court was not applying the federal constitutional standards as set forth in the Hoffman case and the cases that follow the Hoffman which set up what the federal standards are in instances of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.160" offset="14706106">With respect to Malloy, I can't help saying that insofar as his activity is concerned, the only thing that appears in the record is that it was a criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.272" offset="14742573">There was nothing in the record to indicate that he had any legitimate enterprise of any sort, as a matter of fact there is nothing in the record about what he did except that he was convicted of crime on one occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.665" offset="14776114">And the other point that -- oh and in connection with the Hoffman case, I would also like to cite the Singleton case, which came at about that year or shortly after it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.782" offset="14808611">In the Singleton case, there was no showing by either the defendant or the counsel as to what the crimes are, to which the petitioner was objecting revealing any information about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.968" offset="14849362">The defendant remained quiet and the Supreme Court held he was entitled to do so, that was within his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.572" offset="14883739">And as to whether or not a witness should say anything at all, is a matter of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.385" offset="14907040">You can take the case of Rogers versus U.S. in 340 U.S. 367 decided 1951, where a woman secretary I think of some communist group did reveal that she was the secretary and that she had certain records, and I think that was all that was necessary for the Court to hold that she had waived her immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.598" offset="14995856">So that Malloy was faced with very a real problem, and the matter of judgment was that you don't say anything because we don't know when we cross the threshold, when answering questions become very dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.334" offset="15054789">And one other point that I would like to emphasize that I forgot in my original argument was the basis for my hope that the Mapp and the Ker cases, which applied the Fourth to the state, is a reason for us to believe that the Fifth Amendment should also be applied, is that in connection with the Boyd case, the Bram case, the Weeks case, and even the Feldman case, there was language which said, and in the Ker case, the Mapp cases, there was language which said that the Fourth and Fifth are so intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.942" offset="15197208">They supplement one another, that it's utterly illogical to say that the Fourth applies and the Fifth does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.556" offset="15231690">So that our argument basically is twofold, one the Fifth applies to the states under the Fourteenth, and secondly that even though the State of Connecticut recognizes that fact, the State of Connecticut did not apply the constitutional standards that it was obliged to apply under the cases of this Court.</text>
