            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="23.241" offset="196315">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.986" offset="207287">This is an appeal by the United States under the Criminal Appeals Act from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissing an indictment for bank robbery on the ground that a trial of defendant there under would subject him to double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.005" offset="291401">This is how the question arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.037" offset="307493">In May 1956, the defendant Tateo was on trial under a five-count indictment arising out of the robbery of a bank in Port Chester, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.684" offset="362141">One of the counts, count three, charged kidnapping in course of the robbery, an offense which carried life imprisonment and could even have carried death except that the government disclaimed an intention as to that penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.456" offset="437164">After four days of trial in which the codefendant testified and implicated the defendant, he came in on a Monday morning and with counsel present said he had decided to plea guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.630" offset="489932">Now, those proceedings are in the record at pages 69, and on the surface they seem perfectly proper, defendant said he was acting voluntarily, he was represented by counsel, and he even went so far as to consent to a search having disclosed where the money, part of the money from the robbery was hidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.836" offset="582719">However, some years later, the defendant attacked his plea of guilty by a motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.418" offset="629008">I should say that after the plea was accepted, the kidnapping count was dismissed on motion of the defendant with consent of the defendant -- with the consent of the government and the defendant was vented on only four counts, the counts other than the kidnapping charge, he was given twenty two and a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.768" offset="734438">Now that was the sentence which he attacked some years later and his motion under 2255 came before Judge Weinfeld for hearing in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.747" offset="782399">At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Weinfeld came to the conclusion that the plea of guilty was indeed coerced and the reasons for his opinion appear in the record, a gist of it is on page 40A.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.352" offset="844779">What had happened was that after these four days of trial, the Judge in the lobby room in the presence of the attorneys for the defense had said, I think I ought to tell you this, â€œif you finish the trial and your clients are found guilty I am going to start off by imposing the life sentence on the kidnapping charge and then I am going to add consecutive maximum sentences on the other counts on which they are found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.138" offset="987930">Judge Weinfeld found that this has a coercive effect, particularly coercive in a sense because the government's case was very strong and the case was going very badly from the defendant's point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.464" offset="1053236">Judge Newman.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.343" offset="1072776">The government did not appeal in that decision and the government has no quarrel with that decision of Judge Weinfeld.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.179" offset="1100048">What the government did was say okay, we'll start all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.691" offset="1118124">And so they moved not only for a retrial on the counts to which the defendant had pleaded guilty, hey had a new indictment returned reinstating count three, the dismissed kidnapping count.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.008" offset="1199417">It was to that count that the defendant originally made a motion to have it dismissed on the grounds that a trail they are under would constitute double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.036" offset="1247483">And it was at the suggestion of the district Judge, Judge Tyler that the motion was broadened to include both a motion to dismiss the kidnapping count and a motion to dismiss the four counts on which the defendant had pleaded guilty, to which he had pleaded guilty and on which he had received a sentence of twenty two-and-a-half years concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.682" offset="1354062">After considerable argument Judge Tower did dismiss both indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.269" offset="1384469">The new kidnapping indictment and the four -- the indictment with the four counts to which the defendant had pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.076" offset="1415711">It was his view that the action of the trial judge, which coerced the guilty plea kept the case from going to the jury, and therefore, under the mistrial cases, including this Court's recent decision last year in Downum he thought retrial was broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.319" offset="1508603">Now, the government is here appealing only from so much of the decision as dismissed the indictment to which the defendant pleaded guilty and on which he was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.522" offset="1561475">It is not appealing from the dismissal of the kidnapping indictment and the reason --</text>

            <text syncTime="378.913" offset="1619048">The reason for selective appeal Mr. Justice is what we regard as the key to this case, and that is that on the counts to which defendant pleaded guilty, there was a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.359" offset="1680802">The case had come to a conclusion, there was a judgment finally against the (Inaudible), which would have run its course had the defendant not moved to set it aside and it is our view that the decisions of this Court and of lower courts practically from the (Inaudible) of this government are to be a sect that one who moves to have a judgment set aside, re-subject himself to the jeopardy represented by that judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.424" offset="2057070">The whole trend of judicial decision in this country has been that there is power to grant a new trial and this means in a sense when you set aside, to grant a new trial you set aside the judgment and that is start over again on the matters represented by the judgment, and I don't read the mistrial cases as been contrary to that, because in the mistrial --</text>

            <text syncTime="717.233" offset="2972296">And it's interesting that in the United States against Green, it is cited in our brief, one of very early cases setting out the right to demand a new trial this is exactly the distinction that he made, the distinction between the mistrial cases which had already known to exist and the case which had gone to judgment and the fact is that there was a judgment that it was binding until it will set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.008" offset="3091414">Now my opponent says that that rule which he recognizes and which this Court reaffirmed in Green and in Foreman very recently, he says that doesn't apply here because although the case went to judgment, it didn't go to verdict and he argues that there is something that a case ought to be allowed to go to verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.884" offset="3190888">But that's a distinction that doesn't make any logical sense in relation to the judgment rule, because a plea of guilty has always been deemed the equivalent of a verdict, a plea of guilty supports a judgment just the same way as a verdict supports the judgment, it's the judgment, at the end of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.645" offset="3297991">And whatever the Trial Judge did or didn't do wrong in this case, he didn't -- these cases from going to these counsel, going to judgment so that we do end up with a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.423" offset="3349086">And it doesn't seem to me to make sense to say, that if a defendant has gone through a whole trial and get his case reversed on appeal, he can be retried, but this defendant has only gone through part of a trial and had plead guilty cannot be retried even though both cases have gone to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.874" offset="3442918">There are all sorts of errors, a hanging, (Inaudible) is called or an instruction to this regard the defendants evident, an instruction on the wrong theory of the case, these are all the errors which have caused reversal on appeal, but which have never been deemed for a retrial and they are every bit as coercive or passively more coercive than what was done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.794" offset="3578546">Now my opponent says, oh well, there is always the possibility that one slim chance that the jury will have quit in the phase that everything the Judge says, in the face of these wrong instructions and everything else, but if a distinction has to be drawn on that one slim chance seems to me a lot of our appellate lawyers become a matter of gains and I don't believe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.075" offset="3699649">I don't think anybody doubts that the so called hanging charge doesn't leave much of a slim chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.233" offset="3728280">And furthermore if the slim chance is going to be the distinction, it doesn't make sense in this case because here the defendant got much more of a benefit than a slim chance, he got the certainty, understanding in the virtual certainty that the kidnapping count was going to be dismissed, which is certainly more significant than this one slim chance of acquittal in the face of grievous error on the part of the trial Judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.601" offset="3953768">That's another answer, but there is this mystique I should say of having -- the facts of the case have gone to the jury, that it's supposed to distinguish this case from the others and this is one of the distinctions that's offered and I don't find it's a very satisfactory distinction because I don't think it's meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.654" offset="4034017">I think the real question here is why this rule which has been, as I say, the American system from the beginning even if the framers of the Constitution obviously thought that a rule allowing a new trial after judgment had been set aside with a benefit and it is different from the English rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.646" offset="4133909">So the question is what is the real rational of that opinion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.730" offset="4154284">Curiously for a doctrine that has been in our law from the beginning there is almost no philosophy in the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.360" offset="4188766">The Ball case talked about waiver and it didn't -- and so did the earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.867" offset="4218859">It apparently reflects the view that this was something of benefit to the discernment, the right to have a new trial, but this Court both the majority and the dissenting opinions in Green indicated the doctrine of waiver was more of a statement of a result than a realistic appraisal of what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.125" offset="4311855">What the defendant wants to do is go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.326" offset="4320632">If he can't go free he'll take a new trial to get the judgment but it isn't waiver in the sense that that's normally used and so I think we do have to consider what is the philosophy under law in this rule which has been ours from the beginning and it seems to me it's the important -- that doesn't here in the very term judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.851" offset="4410807">Judgment is the ultimate end of a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.289" offset="4424495">This is how a system of law operates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.400" offset="4448946">It can't be wiped out of the books easily and so faced with the significance of judgment, there were really two routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.682" offset="4498056">One is the English route, which gives the appellate court a great deal of power to effect the sentence, but which does set aside a judgment completely only for very grievous error, and which -- one that is done -- does decree that there cannot be a new trail in criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.708" offset="4634206">We haven't timed to intuit the whole English system in a sense discourages appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.376" offset="4656880">I should say in general that the English seem to me to give much more weight to the unreviewable discretion of the trial Judge than we do, but if a judgment is going to result in a defendant going free, if the reverse of a judgment is going to result in the defendant going free, it seems to me inevitable that any closed case is going to be decided against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.187" offset="4772133">And it seems to me inevitable that consciously or unconsciously a feeling of that guilt or innocence is going to affect the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.642" offset="4825945">And so if we are going to have our system which wants to keep its judgment as free from error as possible, if we have a system of appeals where we have reversal not only because an error might have influenced the verdict, but even for errors in procedure like assembling a grand jury, that don't even go to the fairness of a particular trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.201" offset="4960214">If this holds supervisory power of appellant reviews is to be kept, it almost inevitably follows that a -- when you set aside a judgment for that kind of error which does not necessarily go to guilt or innocence, if the system is to work there might be a way where the issues can be retried, the issues represented by the judgment independently of the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.501" offset="5117367">With the development of 2255 it seems to me the same considerations that apply on appeal apply in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.871" offset="5158849">I think the principle goes beyond this case, but it seems to me this case illustrates the principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.686" offset="5310151">It may happen to be seven years in this case, but if this rule of law announced by the District Court is correct, then if this happens everyday, there is seven weeks you would still not be able to retry the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.936" offset="5571166">And of course this is not -- this is a situation in which if he is convicted on retrial, the judge will have complete discretion on sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.861" offset="5786833">The setting aside of a judgment starts the case back on its course and there is an opportunity to re-litigate the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.064" offset="5835630">And I think it's important that this be kept because in the long run, one doesn't know what this decision would have been if we had the English rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.966" offset="5887248">There Judge Tyler in effect himself said he didn't know how Judge Weinfeld would have acted if Judge Weinfeld thought that by granting the motion under 2255, he was allowing the defendant to go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.799" offset="5962585">It is -- the possibility of a life sentence was always in this case as long as the kidnapping was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.323" offset="5996648">And while everybody seems to have thought that adding a consecutive sentence made a difference I do not know, because it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.297" offset="6036564">The statute had been amended in 1951, so that any sentence more than 45 years of time for parole is 15 years, and apparently nobody at the time was aware of that, but this is not important in and off itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.955" offset="6115244">The significant thing is that whenever you have a close case and there obviously can be closer cases than this, it's going to be difficult for a judge to decide the case before him if he knows that a decision setting aside the plea is going to going to result in the defendants going free.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.850" offset="6290787">He said as to a codefendant, I would have given you 55 years, but the codefendant had two bank robberies involved, so that was different, but in that case on page 25 he said, the attorney said I'm sure Your Honor is familiar with the decisions as the other counts can be consecutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.507" offset="6385351">Now of course it was thought at the time that the kidnapping count could be separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.874" offset="6406875">It was only made that the decisions tend to indicate that, that would not be so and it's not an absolutely fixed question now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.530" offset="6433520">But be as it may one of surprising things about this whole thing is that the judge, the attorney and I think Judge Weinfeld, when he got again (Inaudible), the consecutive sentences to a life sentence added something and they don't under the statute which is 18 U.S.C 4202, the defendant would have be eligible for parole at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.893" offset="6538951">I suppose the kidnapping, conviction would have made things good for parole, but the additional sentence wouldn't have affected the judgment at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.456" offset="6837164">It seems to me that the government basically does not like the provisions against double jeopardy in the Constitution when it takes the provision, the position it's taken here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.398" offset="6888991">The protection against double jeopardy is not the protection against twice being convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.811" offset="6914591">It does not like the old English provisions require a former acquittal, a former tender, a former pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.653" offset="6945938">It is a protection against twice being as required to endure trial to be exposed to jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.670" offset="6978017">What happens in this case was that a man the federal district court charged with a serious crime, commenced a trial before a jury and because of actions on the part of the trial judge which the government now concedes were coercive in their affect, he never finished that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.281" offset="7064534">That was the right which was taken from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.968" offset="7075192">That is the right which Judge Tyler found could not be restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.866" offset="7094836">Now it is true and we do not quarrel with and I agree that basically the rule of retrial after a reversal is firmly engrafted in the law, and the government is trying to curtail this depravation of a jury trial into a retrial after reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.431" offset="7185115">This is -- we make no claim that the fact that this was not an appeal, that's it's a collateral attack has any importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.621" offset="7221896">What we say is this, essentially, two wrongs were done to the defendant Tateo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.733" offset="7246346">He was coerced in a plea of guilty and a judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.566" offset="7265677">When he went for Judge Weinfeld and Judge Weinfeld set aside that plea of guilty and that wrong was remedied, but another independent wrong connected factual part and parcel happened to him and that was that his right to have the jury originally empanelled to hear his case try and conclude that case was taken from him.</text>
