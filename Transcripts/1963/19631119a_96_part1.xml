            <label>Mr. Justin N. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="37.698" offset="254203">Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.565" offset="269667">This case differs from the state apportionment cases and from the Georgia congressional district case, congressional districting case, because this case involves racial gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.580" offset="337690">It presents the question may a state segregate voter by race in the drawing of congressional district lines?</text>
            <text syncTime="70.244" offset="384397">At the same time, it presents another question, may a state by its silence, by its refusal to introduce any proof whatsoever justify such segregation as a matter of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.702" offset="462137">I have phrased this latter question in this way because the appellants contend that in creating New York Counties, Manhattan Islands, if you will, four congressional districts in 1961 when the legislature cut down the number of districts previously apportioned to Manhattan at 6-to-4.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.243" offset="568299">The legislature created two of those four districts that were racially gerrymandered.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.207" offset="600168">One, a virtually all white district, and one, a virtually all Negro and for the Puerto Rican district, and not only were these districts racially gerrymandered but as we prove below and as I shall review for this Court momentarily, they were racially gerrymandered by the legislature in a way which presented the maximum so to speak and that the legislature could not possibly have created districts in this particular urban area which would have been any more segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.969" offset="783235">The state has been absolutely silent as to the background of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.397" offset="804968">There is no legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.183" offset="816149">The districting statute was enacted in 1961 in an extraordinary or special session of the legislature convened one day when the bill was laid on the desks of the legislators or one evening I should say and enacted the next morning and signed by the governor that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.862" offset="890859">No hearings, no debate, there was a vote but that was all, so that that sheds no light.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.693" offset="926177">Therefore, we had to prove that the purpose and effect of the portion of the statute we challenge, namely the portion directed toward the districting of Manhattan Island, we had purpose and effect of apportion we challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.745" offset="998379">We had to prove the purpose and effect I should say by analysis and inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.277" offset="1020531">And we submit that if our proof, if the totality of our proof, if you will, to use the language of Johnson against Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.588" offset="1037772">If the totality of our proof is not deemed sufficient for this purpose, it would mean in our judgment that no one could ever prove unconstitutional racial districting in any urban area of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.899" offset="1138918">And we also submit that if this proof that I'm about to discuss does not prove racial districting, in the case of Manhattan Island, then it proves that there was no rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.789" offset="1194506">It proves to use the language of the Solicitor General of the last week "crazy quilt districting", no rhyme or reason districting, because I submit there is no other discernable basis for this districting other than race.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.790" offset="1398575">The question is, what if they do and how did they do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="328.955" offset="1419160">Well, what did they start with?</text>
            <text syncTime="332.357" offset="1432848">They started that the will where they only contained political subdivision, an island, New York County.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.630" offset="1465866">It's not a very complicated configuration really.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.000" offset="1479346">There were no other county lines or rivers or boundaries that they had to give consideration to and they had to cut it into four parts and they started with the population of 1,698,241 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.199" offset="1552175">A quarter -- a quarter of that would be approximately 424,000 and cutting it into four parts, they were confronted of course with one fact which was unusual, and that is that approximately 40% of that 1,698,000 people were Negroes and Puerto Ricans.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.144" offset="1651963">Now, in doing the carving of this corpus, they took a very delicate scalpel and made their first incision, if you look at the language of the statute, in the creation of the Seventeenth Congressional District right at the point where the East River meets 14th Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.874" offset="1742869">This is the point of the first incision.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.550" offset="1809533">This was a point immediately South of an area we call Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper which interestingly enough by decision of our Court of Appeals in 1949 in the case of Dorsey against Stuyvesant Town was maintained as a non-integrated housing project, the project built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and which according to the proof in the record obtained 23,000 people of whom they're only 105 non-whites and Puerto Ricans.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.793" offset="2118510">Until they ended up at a hundred and -- well at Central Park, the line here and those that the Justices, if it please the Court, would know Manhattan.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.746" offset="2162395">This line along Central Park, between 72nd Street and 110th, is on the eastern border of the park so it contains no people, it merely contained the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.172" offset="2212028">And they ran it up along that eastern boarder of the park until 110th Street.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.802" offset="2254555">Yes Mr. Justice White, the eastern border of Central Park West to 110th Street, where they ran along the southern border of 110th Street the northern border in the park against obtaining no people.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.234" offset="2320280">Now, down along the and not straight across, mind you, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.423" offset="2341073">But down along the eastern border of the park, the -- well the Western, it's the eastern border of the park, the West side of 5th Avenue until they got to 98th Street and then started this step-like configuration and bringing back into the river and back to the point of place of beginning, the next point of a decision with a scalpel in the 18th Congressional District.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.942" offset="2459146">Here they start at the East River and 165th Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.863" offset="2478791">Again, not in the northern tip or any place else but they cut right in here, twist and turn around, make their little excised here for Washington Heights and St. Nicholas Terrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.029" offset="2535528">Come down along again to Morningside Heights but now down behind the Morningside Park, if you will, back down on 110th and conforming to the border of the Seventeenth as it was originally cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.946" offset="2603133">That gave them two Congressional Districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.729" offset="2614314">There were two left, two -- two remaining, they drew a straight line across 86th Street and cut the two remaining Districts in -- in half.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.743" offset="2654333">Not quite in half in terms of population but 86th Street was the convenient cross town street.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.413" offset="11605034">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.585" offset="11621752">In our presentation, we shall proceed principally along two lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.952" offset="11651218">First and this in a great degree will be responsive to what Mr. Feldman had been doing and saying using a visual method as well, we will cover some of the principal aspects of the evidence in the record which was before the District Court and second, we will go to the legal proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.597" offset="11749752">The question of the legal insufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint and if some time remains, and if I may, that second argument will be tied in if the responsibility is there with references to the somewhat related subjects of justiciability and lack of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.395" offset="11860929">I think it might be well if I were to proceed first Your Honors to the question of proof and the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.350" offset="11892799">And I must say I was quite intrigued by some of the theories of burden of proof that were expected -- that were expounded here a moment ago and of some of the concepts of when it is and under what circumstances the state must proceed with proof in order to defend what we will show in this perfectly common place, redistricting; something which as we shall see in a moment, raises no suspicion of unconstitutionality whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.834" offset="12034696">But first, in order to address myself to that issue, I would like to dispel, if I can, two notions which have been fomented by the appellants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.233" offset="12088299">Your Honors undoubtedly in the course of Mr. Feldman's arguments that it was unclear to say the least just what the theory of appellant's proof and burden of proof might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.176" offset="12140126">But as we -- best we've been able to gather it from a reading of the briefs and from listening to Mr. Feldman a few moments ago, it ranges all the way from doing nothing at all but making a statistical showing of disparity to, if I may recall, Mr. Feldman's phrase, "Twisting the legislature, twisting and turning deliberately to create on the one hand as lily white a district as possible and on the other hand, as thoroughly saturated the Negro and Puerto Rican district as possible."</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.284" offset="12284531">So I presume that first, I must dispose if I can of the argument that even unintentional segregation is constitutionally prohibited in -- in a congressional districting situation of this kind and for that reason that I mere showing of considerable disparity and of course we're assuming arguendo for the purpose of the discussion of the fact and the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.002" offset="12395395">We're assuming arguendo under this section of our argument that they have stated a colorable claim under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.523" offset="12425488">But they -- they feel that all they have to do is show this mere disparity in ethnic composition and that will be sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the state and there are many, many reasons why this undoubtedly must be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.302" offset="12484629">In the first place, I think this Court well knows from experience that there's a tendency on the part of people in certain ethnic groups to settle in large cities in certain areas and these reasons have a great variety, a great range of reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.621" offset="12569893">It may range all the way from the desire to live amongst the other members of the same ethnic group and it can go all the way to such things as discrimination and housing but whatever the reasons and whatever the degree of those reasons, the fact is and it's a real fact of life and certainly a fact of life in the Island of Manhattan as it is in many other cities of the United States that people tend to create to -- to gather very often and reside very often in certain ethnic concentrations in the neighborhood if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.529" offset="12713462">And in this particular case, what we're dealing with mostly was citing Eastside of Manhattan, what counsel has been pleased to refer to as the lily white district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.170" offset="12752018">We were also dealing with that well-known area called Harlem with approximately a quarter of the Island's 1,700,000 population, one of the greatest ethnic concentrations and even in New York City area and in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.087" offset="12819728">Now, this as I say only reflects a common place, this congressional districting and it seems to me rather ironic that the appellants have relied and that Judge Murphy, the dissenting judge below, went right along reading the case the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.217" offset="12892244">The Hernandez case apparently is that on which appellants relied for the first part of this curious theory of burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.411" offset="12929024">And Your Honors well remember how totally different the Hernandez case was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.620" offset="12949817">There was a case where over a period of I think 25 years or generation or so, Mexicans were not able -- those of Mexican descent and origin rather, I don't mean Mexican citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.321" offset="12996629">American citizens of Mexican descent were never to be found on any jury panel in the State of Texas and this of course is a very unique situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.571" offset="13037693">Could one say that there are no people of Mexican heritage who would be qualified for jury service in the State of Texas or any other state?</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.959" offset="13075205">This was so unique, so uncommon, so extraordinary situation but of course the burden would be upon the state to go forward and explain this tremendous anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.006" offset="13123375">That's an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.271" offset="13132466">Here you had a case which if it's akin to anything in that respect might much more be akin to the case, for example, of a Negro tried in a criminal case let's say a capital case and not a Negro on that particular jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.560" offset="13209579">Well now, I don't think I need to label the point that nobody in the United States, white, Negro or otherwise can claim that he is entitled in a particular jury under particular circumstances to have a juryman of his own ethnic background or jurymen of his own ethnic background on the particular panel or on -- in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.764" offset="13298395">That's quite a far cry from Hernandez but certainly, Hernandez which was relied upon by Mr. Feldman so heavily and by Judge Murphy as his opinion will show offers anything but support for the curious theory that Mr. Feldman advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.861" offset="13366836">Now, isn't it a logical culmination of a theory such as suggested by Mr. Feldman, isn't it inevitable that if we were to adopt that theory, wouldn't we be lead in the direction of having to mix the races in certain proportions in congressional districts?</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.738" offset="13446353">For instance, there are 37.5%, maybe it's 38% Negroes and Puerto Ricans residents in the Island of Manhattan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.478" offset="13485328">And if were to carry out logically the -- the -- the theories that are being expounded here a few moments ago by Mr. Feldman, we would have to think in terms of -- of -- of equalizing the racial in all four of them -- this shows only two of the districts but on all four of Manhattan's districts, we'd have districts vis-à-vis one another which are roughly 37 -- 38% Negro, Puerto Rican if we were to follow that its logical culmination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.262" offset="13608417">And although it may not be strictly relevant to the question of burden of proof, I think this might be a good point at which to get into the subject of -- and I mention as is this, "A fallacy of speaking of segregation in the context of congressional districting."</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.126" offset="13679888">Now, there are no cases extent and I think that will be agreed to that say, "that this is an angle in a congressional districting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.176" offset="13724087">It's necessary in congressional districting to classify every time a districting is going to be made and I don't care what the motive, what the criteria, no matter what the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.995" offset="13775391">Whenever a congressional districting is done, the result inevitably is going to be either where you have a law at neighborhood by column with a tremendous concentration of one ethnic -- or one or two ethnic groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.137" offset="13827950">The result inevitably will be either to concentrate them at one district or to divide and disperse them among two or more districts, it can't happen any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.358" offset="13868805">And no matter what lines is drawn, this is the inevitably and variable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.119" offset="13891897">Now, school cases in which the term "segregation" is used so extensibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.211" offset="13916244">Of course, in the root case, in the original cases under the school segregation situation going back 10 years of whereabouts to the opinion of the Chief Justice in the Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.532" offset="13973504">In that case, you had state action exemplified by statutes simply setting up segregated Negroes schools and segregated white schools and this was struck down of course in the Brown case and there, the state statutes had made segregation mandatory on the Brown integration was made mandatory and the central constitutional fact there of course was the inadequacy of segregated education, a touchstone, if you please, by which you can measure a standard -- a constitutional standard to be applied in a situation of that sort and to understand the proper use of the word “segregation” in the context of that kind of a district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.794" offset="14166497">Because a school district is a districting situation just as is a congressional district situation in the sense that lines must be drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.800" offset="14486549">Now, I wanted to show Mr. Justice Goldberg, if I might, that there's all -- a world of difference in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.956" offset="14511208">Now, these were impermissible objectives, these ideas of having white schools, and Negro schools, what in congressional districting, I submit and I think it's beyond any argument that there is no such set of fact as the inadequacy for instance of segregated education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.218" offset="14600234">This may be in the sense anticipating the argument that I hope later to make on the law but I touched on it briefly because of the inappropriate use of the word "segregation" here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.397" offset="14648926">But after the Brown case, we began to have some new phenomenon, when -- when segregation was caused for instance by school district lines in the context of existing neighborhoods and we -- existing racial neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.217" offset="14716217">And schools persisted in their segregation not because of any plan and deliberate design but because of the neighborhood concept, problems arose just the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.515" offset="14765432">And we have mentioned in our brief at several places a very interesting decision which was made by Judge Dooling of the Eastern District Court of New York in the Branche case, rather recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.778" offset="14818513">In fact, Mr. Sandifer was a counsel, one of the counsels in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.796" offset="14838575">And there, Mr. -- there, Judge Dooling held at the mere existence of de facto segregation was unconstitutional and there's a good reason that the term “segregation” can be applied in that sort of case because there, it's possible to isolate what is constitutionally desirable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3750.425" offset="15105024">Well now, Mr. Justice Goldberg, when we're dealing with congressional districting, we're certainly dealing with large groups of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.293" offset="15140551">We're not dealing with individuals as we are at jury box cases or in seating in a court or in bus transportation, things of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="3769.695" offset="15182137">We are dealing with a large group of people and it may be true that I forget the plaintiff's name, Mrs. Wright, I think is the first plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.573" offset="15213693">Mrs. Wright or Ms. Wright as the case might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.598" offset="15225814">Ms. Wright may have some sort of a desire along the lines that Your Honor mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.966" offset="15247235">But the fact is that from a constitutional standpoint, when it's necessary for a legislature to deal with these large numbers of people, we're not impinging on individual rights and as Mr. Justice Black indicated in his questioning of Mr. Feldman a few moments back, there is here an entirely different situation and that is the question if -- if need be, who is to determine whether from a -- from a judicial standpoint, who is to determine whether a minority group, Negroes, Puerto Ricans or any other minority groups for that matter are better off when they concentrated one district or dispersed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.833" offset="15394670">And as a matter of fact, Mr. Justice Black began to suggest in his questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.460" offset="15413164">Several very good reasons that easily could be elaborated upon why it might be a very excellent idea for power to be concentrated for the political power of a minority group in congressional districting and considering the functions of a single method district system, it might very well be a very idea if it concentrates that political power there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.440" offset="15501145">But we are not weighing the relative merits of these two opposite concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.151" offset="15531969">What we are doing instead, Mr. Justice Goldberg is first, before even getting in to all the specifics of the district to show the great difference, for instance, between school districting cases which are after all in a sense districting cases and congressional districting cases, there is all the difference in the world and this makes all the difference in the constitutional result and in the burden of proof and in everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.348" offset="15632802">But there in the school case as you can apply the term “segregation” because certainly, it's possible as I was saying just before to isolate what is constitutionally desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.852" offset="15674807">And the only direction in which you can move and have to touch on that, you have the desideratum, is in the direction of integration, that's clear in the school cases but --</text>
