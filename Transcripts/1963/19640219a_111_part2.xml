            <text syncTime="5.037" offset="123486">In discussing the second of the two issues in this case, I'd come to the point, just before the recess, of calling attention on our comparative print to the long proviso to Section 8 (b) which appears on page 4 of the little pamphlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.243" offset="212302">It provides that, for the purposes of paragraph 4, nothing contained in the paragraph shall be construed to prohibit publicity, other than picketing, for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers and members of the labor organization, that a product or products are produced by an employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute, that here would of course be Servette, and are distributed by another employer, that here would be the chain stores, as long as the picketing doesn't have certain effects, and no one suggests that it has those effects in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.319" offset="384606">So, the question is whether picketing at the retail stores falls within the language of covering p -- I said the picketing, I'm getting confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.765" offset="450435">The handbilling at the retail stores falls within the language “publicity for the purpose of advising the public that a product or products are produced by one employer and distributed by a secondary employer.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="128.961" offset="619186">I was just concerned, Mr. Justice Stewart, that there have been three views advanced as to the meaning of this proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.014" offset="663385">One view is that advanced by the National Labor Relations Board in this case, but most notably in a case known as the Great Western Broadcasting Company case which was decided by the Ninth Circuit before this case in an authority of -- which case, the Ninth Circuit decided this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.153" offset="743946">The Board there suggested that the proviso should be read so broadly that it covered virtually all publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.795" offset="782503">I can state its interpretation best by giving a concrete illustration based on the Great Western Broadcasting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.608" offset="817821">There, the Labor Union was in a dispute with the broadcasting station.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.766" offset="838405">The station advertised a number of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.826" offset="862647">One of them, I'm imagining, but one of the products was Sunoco gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.085" offset="903711">The Union, getting nowhere in its dispute with the television or broadcasting station, picketed the Sunoco stores or the downtown department store, if you will, who's -- which advertised over the radio station.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.947" offset="983124">The Board took the view that the radio station was engaged, in an economic sense, in helping to produce Sunoco gasoline and that Sunoco gasoline was being distributed by the Sunoco filling stations and, therefore, it came within the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.269" offset="1084479">In this case, while the Board does not give up that meaning, it agrees with me that the case doesn't require so broad an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.173" offset="1128051">But personally, I find that interpretation extremely difficult and we think it can go on a narrower ground but, it should be understood, that is one of the meanings of the statute that has been put forward but I'm not arguing it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.395" offset="1184998">Now, the other extreme is the interpretation adopted by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.827" offset="1218644">It says that produce -- product or products produced by an employer means the manufacturer who makes it or perhaps who processes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.240" offset="1264306">He would be the manufacturer or processor and carries it no farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.864" offset="1298787">The interpretation that we advocate in this case lies midway between.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.555" offset="1325641">We urge that the word "produced" should be given the same meaning in this statute that it has been given in other labor legislation, most notably in the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.278" offset="1392515">The Fair Labor Standards Act does have specific definitions of these terms and differs from this statute in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.830" offset="1426683">It defines “produce or production” to include producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, transporting or, in any other manner, working on any goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.874" offset="1474853">And, it has been held many, many times that a wholesaler of goods who packages and repackages, sometimes he labels, sometimes he doesn't, and sometimes he puts in smaller lots what he receives in large lots, who certainly handles the goods as well as stores them and distributes them is engaged in producing within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.598" offset="1573804">And, we say that the word must be taken in that sense here so that there is, under our view as we urge it, some following of the physical product.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.156" offset="1619989">It doesn't involve this virtually any economic relationship that contributes to the ultimate sale of the product, but says that the Union comes within the proviso if the person with whom it had its dispute produced it in this sense and if the person who is selling it and whom it is handbilling is distributing it in the sense of getting it to the ultimate consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.925" offset="1751124">We think there are essentially four reasons for construing the proviso, at least that broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.722" offset="1790307">The first and, in a sense, the second I've already inverted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.453" offset="1813191">"Produced" was a word that had a well-known meaning under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the men who participated in the drafting of this statute were, well, must have been well-aware of its meaning and the definition in the Act and the interpretation put upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.274" offset="1904515">We think where there are two statutes in the same general field, the labor area, there's a strong presumption that Congress used the word in the same senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.634" offset="1949863">We feel strength in that by the fact-- by the case United States against Montgomery Ward and Company which, some of you may recall, grew out of the seizure by the president during World War II of the wholesaling and mail order business in Montgomery Ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.877" offset="2050905">There was no authority for that seizure under the War Labor Disputes Act, unless it could be said that Montgomery Ward was engaged in producing war materials, but they were a mail order house or a wholesaler and had some retail stores, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.056" offset="2119555">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the meaning of “produced” in the War Labor Disputes Act, also it contained no artificial definition, must be taken to be the same as the meaning in the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="520.245" stopTime="530.076">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="520.245" offset="2184338">Didn't the -- or am I mistaken, didn't the War Labor Disputes Act have a provision incorporating, by reference, the definition of "produce" in the Fair Labor Standards Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="530.076" stopTime="823.974">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="530.076" offset="2223626">I think the answer is partly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.988" offset="2239300">Let me explicate what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.471" offset="2249226">I would say, no, it did not incorporate the definition by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.585" offset="2265736">It did -- the provision you're thinking of is a provision which directed the War Labor Board in rendering its recommendations on labor disputes, decisions in the substantive sense, to be guided by the provisions of various laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.231" offset="2352253">This, certainly, tended to bring the two statutes together and I think, in that sense, perhaps made that a somewhat easier case, so far as the words are concerned, than this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.973" offset="2407215">But, the Court went upon the theory that they -- statutes were in pari materia.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.207" offset="2436159">I think there was no ex -- I don't think there can be said to be any fair incorporation by reference of the definitions and it would seem to me that the case rests on their being in pari materia more than on that section to which Your Honor refers.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.152" offset="2512018">Now, there is another thing about that opinion, and that is the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in that case, said quite apart from the Fair Labor Standards Act definition of “produced” which still find this was produced within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.630" offset="2577847">So, that, I think is -- again tends to cut in my -- in my favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.679" offset="2610134">With that background, we think there is a -- the words would be a very strong inference that the word “produced” was used in the technical sense that had been used elsewhere in the Labor Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.148" offset="2667917">But, I certainly can't say that that mere background excludes necessarily the other interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.529" offset="2701458">The additional facts that seemed to me to be important is that there were a number of rather well-known common law decisions holding that a Union may follow a product through -- to the various stages of distribution and that the employers injured along the way, if I may put it that way, were not truly neutrals.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.902" offset="2814934">We've sited some of those in our brief, and some of those cases dealt with situations where the primary employer was not a manufacturer alone and we think that, remembering that this legislation was, to a considerable extent, a battle of experts, that Common Law Theory ties in with the meaning that we would give the words here.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.698" offset="2930186">Finally, I would stress this is a proper interpretation because I think this is a case where there are perhaps or are at worst, from our point of view, two possible meanings of the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.827" offset="3006673">One would be to read “produced” as a word of art, such as it had become in the Fair Labor Standards Act and the same meaning in the sense of art that was given in Montgomery Ward, and the other perhaps is to take it more narrowly because there is legislation where it has been read more narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.582" offset="3081697">But, given those two interpretations and given the fact that if -- that this statute, absent the proviso, would be a restriction upon all forms of communication of the fact of the dispute, not only handbilling but radio advertising, newspaper publicity, and so forth, that the proviso should be construed broadly in order to avoid curtailing a method -- methods of expression, of publicity, of communication, all be an expression and communication in a context of an economic dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.690" offset="3262151">And, that desire, which appears quite clearly in the legislative history, and the importance of preserving that right seemed to us to be enough to resolve any doubt that the words and the other materials I mentioned leave about the meaning of "produced" and to require giving it at least as broad an interpretation as it has in the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.475" offset="3425259">Respondent does not have any major differences with the Board's general analysis, overall construction, or statutory scheme of the secondary boycott provisions of 1959 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.391" offset="3472906">Indeed, on major points, responded was fully -- in full agreement with the Board's position, particularly as expressed in the Tree Fruits case.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.673" offset="3506030">I might add here at the beginning that even if this Court should not decide that coercion per se is proper and the proper interpretation in the Tree Fruits case, as I will later expand upon, there was coercion in fact in the Servette case.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.863" offset="3574784">And, the record so points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.448" offset="3589204">A significant difference, in our respective positions, in the fact situation before this Court is that the Board, without any justification, we submit - one, sharply restricted the plain meaning of the term "any individual" as it appear in 8 (b)(4)(i) and, two, has greatly brought in the phrase “a product or products that are produced by an employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute and are distributed by another employer,” as it appears in the second exception proviso for Section 8 (b)(4)(ii).</text>
            <text syncTime="908.719" offset="3738206">By such an exercise of statutory construction, the Board has not only macerated the plain meaning of the statutory language but has nullified congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.008" offset="3783450">Like the procrustean bed, the Board has adopted the technique in this case that if the traveler is too long, you cut him down to fit the bed and, if he is too short, like in Producer, you stretch him to fit the bed's dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.243" offset="3840293">In the first issue before this Court, the question involved is whether individuals, store managers, and supervisors of the chain store supermarkets who are approached by the Union agents and were induced and encouraged not to handle or sell products distributed by a respondent or to do business with respondent or individuals with the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.595" offset="3921795">I submit the issue between myself and my client and, on one hand, and the Solicitor General and the Board, on the other hand, is a very narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.929" offset="3959097">The Board would set, initially, that “any individual” does not mean any individual, but only include certain individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.682" offset="3986056">From the outset, this Court has repeatedly stated that the statute is not always open to construction but only where the language used in the statute requires interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.077" offset="4027643">Where the statute is ambiguous or as of such doubtful or obscure meaning that reasonable minds can -- might be uncertain or disagree as to its meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.048" offset="4463574">The reason being that these type of employees, including supervisors, and the legislative debates go into this at some length, found that these supervisors were subject to, either because they were members of the Union, subject to Union discipline or, as ex-members, were sympathetic with it or who, because they work with the rank-and-file employees, have the same economic ideals and outlook and philosophy as a normal employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.458" offset="4841200">Including corporate officers who act as the employer in the full sense in understanding of common powers, to include them with an individual does not thwart congressional intent and does not really strain the statute to its outer limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.220" offset="5476289">So, therefore, at the very least, the Universal Camera would dictate that the -- that the findings of a trial examiner are subject to review and, on that short record of uncontradicted evidence, it shows, one, the manager of one Kory's department, when approached by the agents of the Union to take the products off the shelves, said “I'll have to speak to my supervisor.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.507" offset="6009396">This, the trial examiner and now the Board says, shows that this store -- this -- all store managers had the authority to make decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.856" offset="6086823">It undermines his argument because it shows, at the time that the Union officials came, the time they committed the proscribed activity, this particular store manager had no such authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.334" offset="6632678">Here, the crux of the difference is the phrase, “A product of products produced by an employer with whom a labor organization has a primary dispute and is distributed by another employer.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.762" offset="6746467">As this Court has said in the McBoyle case, 283 U.S. 25,27, when a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke, in the common mind, only the picture of vehicles moving on land, the statute should not be extended to aircraft simply because it may seem to us that a similar policy applies or upon the speculation that if the legislature had thought of it, very likely, broader words would have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.954" offset="6855137">In fact, the Court took the same similar position in Western Union Telegraph v. Lenroot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.433" offset="6881155">As an analysis of the exception proviso and its history indicates clearly, we submit, that Congress meant to limit the exemption to producers of products as that term is commonly understood.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.516" offset="6989406">The House bill on the other hand, precluded any kind of secondary boycott activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.416" offset="7013021">At the Conference stage, virtual agreement was reached except for the secondary boycott provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.180" offset="7036113">As the Solicitor General has written, the House stood immovably upon its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.057" offset="7059623">The Senate conferees were only able to obtain the proviso, permitting publicity other than picketing in a very narrow and limited situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.971" offset="7103300">The final compromise between the Senate and House bill -- and the House bill did not merely relate to publicity other than picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.511" offset="7129422">It also -- it also limited permissible secondary boycotts to those involved in the distribution of products produced by a producer with whom the labor organization has a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.184" offset="7180100">I believe the legislative history, pointed out by the Board and in my brief, supports that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.090" offset="7207685">At the time the Senate and the House conferees were attempting to resolve the difference between their respective bills, Senator Kennedy introduced to and had placed upon the calendar of the Senate a resolution which instructed the Senate conferees to insist upon the inclusion of certain provisions in the conference agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.370" offset="7292844">Included in the provisions dealing with the amendments to 8 (b)(4) was the following proviso, “Provided that nothing contained in this subsection (b) shall be construed to prohibit publicity for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers, that an establishment is operated or goods are produced or distributed by an employer engaged in a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.781" offset="7418546">Significantly, this language was not adopted by the Congress, though Senator Kennedy himself asked it to be in the senate resolution which was -- came before the final conference committee meeting which made the decision as to what the lang-- which language shall be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.381" offset="7480926">This cannot be dismissed, as the Board would urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.570" offset="7497644">This legislative history, not only shows that Congress intended to limit the exception to produce as a product which are distributed by another, but further exemplifies the fact that Congress considered that there was a distinction between the words "produced" and "distribute."</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.162" offset="7572041">Furthermore, the Board asked the Court to read the statutory language as though it contained a phrase originally presented to but later elimined-- eliminated by Congress in the cause of an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.604" offset="7621778">This, it is submitted, the -- this Court has often said it cannot do, and I cite the Board of Pipeline case which is a Circuit case and the absence to picketing case on page 17 in footnote of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.746" offset="7666395">A further analysis of the language of 8 (b)(4) in the proviso underscores the fact that the limiting language of the proviso was intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.963" offset="7703176">To begin with, Congress not only limited the coverage of the proviso to situations with a labor organization has a dispute which producers of product but by the additional language in the proviso that these products are distributed by another employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.329" offset="7768691">It is obvious that Congress meant that the product must be capable of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.833" offset="7790738">The services of Servette are not capable of distribution unless the Board would have this Court, not only broaden the term "producer of products," but ignore the qualifying additional language in regard to the fact that product should be capable of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.599" offset="7861791">At the very least, the Board's unduly broad definition of the term "producer of products" would necessitate that the additional qualifying phrase "distributed by another employer" should be treated as surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.874" offset="7926888">Thus, it is submitted, this it is submitted, would be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.522" offset="7945488">Moreover, the inconsistency between the position of the Board in Tree -- in the Tree Fruits case on statutory construction and the position it takes here is glaring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.286" offset="7988537">In its argument, to show that Congress intended its secondary boycott activity of this nature constitutes threat, coercion, and restraint with the meaning of 8 (b)(4)(ii) in the Tree Fruits case, it properly note that a subsequent qualification to the existing proviso shows that when Cong -- that Congress, when it was intent -- when it intended to condition and proscribe against secondary activity upon proof of its effect, said so explicitly and cited on this point the fact that Congress added in the proviso the publicity -- that publicity activity will not be permitted if it has the effect of inducing an individual employed by any other person other than the primary employer in the course of his employment to refuse to pick up, deliver, or transport any goods, or not to perform any services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.686" offset="8182157">We certainly agree with that logic but say it should be carried on further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.533" offset="8197517">Surely, by the same reasoning, it follows - one, that within the very same proviso, second proviso, Congress could and did make a limitation in regard to producer of products that it considered proper and that the language used by Congress expressing the further limitation in regard to the effect of the inducement fortifies respondent's position that producer of products is to be given its ordinary commonsense meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.400" offset="8316949">For both in the proviso, as well in 8 (b)(4), Congress spelled out in detail the proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.799" offset="8350595">Thus, it stated in 8 (b)(4)(i) that inducing an individual to refuse to, and you can follow this in the Act, "Use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on goods, articles, materials or commodities or to perform any services, was violative of its purpose."</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.123" offset="8435858">Well, the Act, if its purpose was to force or require any person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any producer, processor, or manufacturer or to cease doing business with any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.706" offset="8486222">Now, this is all in the Act and statutory language, not only in the Act itself but in the proviso itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.007" offset="8515375">Surely, therefore, had Congress desired to adopt an exception as broad as the Board would argue, it could well have taken language from the statute and the very proviso which is in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.743" offset="8566366">It could have easily used the phraseology of something like this, that such publicity shall not be prohibited when a labor organization has a dispute with the employer who uses, handles, transports, or otherwise deals in products of any producer, processor, or manufacturer or otherwise does business with the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.165" offset="8656018">This is the very language which this Board is now urging upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.414" offset="8673050">It exists in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.832" offset="8678693">It exists in the proviso, but when we're speaking of a producer of products, we have something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.547" offset="8701576">Thus, Congress not only failed to adopt existing language under the statute and the proviso which would accomplish the end the Board urges but, as pointed out before, specifically refuse to adopt broader terminology covering respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.973" offset="8767300">Instead it chose to limit its terminology and its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.031" offset="8787466">If this Court extends the terminology “producer of products” as it exists in the proviso, it would be, it is submitted, differentially expanding congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.462" offset="8833233">It is submitted, as urged before, the congressional intent has been made quite clear by the language of the statute and by its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.692" offset="8866147">Certainly, Congress has a right to limit the scope of an exception and Congress was justified in doing so insofar as its intent was a proper one, one admitted by the Board to restrict the spread of labor disputes throughout the community and to limit the power to put pressure upon neutral parties having nothing whatsoever to do with the Union's grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.803" offset="8970533">Given the broad interpretation of the proviso that the Board urges, which spread the conflict far beyond the concept of "following an annuity of product," this doctrine of lec -- limiting secondary boycotts to unfair product situations has been advanced and improved and approved of in at least one Supreme Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.926" offset="9055065">In Duplex v. Deering, Justice Holmes' dissent, as pointed out in the brief, recognized the distinction between following an unfair product of a manufacturer, with whom a labor organization has a dispute, and secondary boycott activities against those who only deal in the product or in some lesser fashion, have a relationship to the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.192" offset="9148165">As a matter of fact, the principal case the Board seems to distinguish Auburn Draying, cited in its brief on pages 18 -- of -- I think its page 18, was cited by Justice Holmes in his dissenting opinion in Duplex to support the position he took there, rather than aiding the Boards position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.901" offset="9234996">It submitted that this case undermines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.827" offset="9250670">For, in that case, there was a very similar type of boycott as exists in the present instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.347" offset="9272717">Their truck drivers had a dispute with a trucking company in the same way as the drivers in the instant case had a dispute with Servette.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.520" offset="9305422">In Auburn, the Union used its influence on customers, or potential customers, or the trucking company in an effort to have these neutral employers cease doing business with the trucking company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.259" offset="9360384">The situation is clearly comparable and the court, in the Auburn case, clearly stated that this constituted coercion which was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.172" offset="9404061">It is submitted that that case is directly comparable to the instant one and, rather than supporting the Board's position, it undermines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.763" offset="9430392">In addition, the Board cites other cases in its brief purportedly standing for the proposition that it is proper for the a labor Union to follow down to the retail level products which are handled at any stage of manufacture or distribution by an employer with whom it has a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.775" offset="9494444">The Goldfinger case, which it most relies upon, does not support that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.567" offset="9517641">For, there, the dispute was against the manufacturer of delicate testing products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.313" offset="9532583">He cured them, he vindicated them, he added to them, he was a manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.563" offset="9549615">In the Bossert case, cited by the petitioner, dispute was also against a manufacturer, in that case the case, the -- in that case, non-Union manufactured doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.843" offset="9598725">Only one case seemingly supports their position which they cite and that's a Pennsylvania case, Lyons auto case, and that case is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.701" offset="9634147">There, the court refused under Pennsylvania -- under the Pennsylvania anti-injunction statute to enjoin picketing against products distributed by a distributor with whom the Union had a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.853" offset="9686810">The court in that case, however, specifically stated and emphasized that, "In order that there'd be no misconception of the scope of this decision, one, that under the Anti-injunction Acts, acts committed can be enjoined in Pennsylvania whether or not they are legal or illegal."</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.919" offset="9775000">Furthermore, while the point has not been argued, respondent raised it -- did raised in its brief, at footnote 19 on page 23, the fact as to whether the proviso applies at all and this directs itself to the questions of Justice Stewart and other Justices who have spoken out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.184" offset="9848142">It is noted that the handbilling activities in the locus in quo in front of the stores under the circumstances of an admitted boycott of dealers which had all the meaningful indicia of picketing can scarcely be distinguished from this latter type of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.455" offset="9953155">As indicated in the brief, the restatement of tort's definition of picketing includes this type of handbilling in locus in quo for the purposes sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.186" offset="9996100">Other cases so included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.660" offset="10006026">And this Court in the Boyd and Gossom case indicated that the essential element is on the spot holding up something or walking something but, in any way, on the spot pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.747" offset="10058376">And that's what exists in the handbilling and I'm sure this Court would not clearly make a distinction between that which is on a stick and that which is on the hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.282" offset="10108531">It might also add in regard to the Montgomery Ward case which the Solicitor General has cited that, first of all, the case specifically said it was relying upon the statute, the War Labors Dispute has -- the War Labors Act statute which said that we will apply the fair labor standards' provisions and definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.497" offset="10197347">The court admittedly did go on and decide on other grounds but, in and so looking at the citing on the grounds, first, it said, since manufacturer and producer, adjoined together, unless we give a broad interpretation to the word "producer," it will all be covered by the word "manufacturer."</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.395" offset="10280939">In this case, in this proviso, we do not have that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.673" offset="10294105">We only have the word "producer."</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.671" offset="10306017">Thirdly, the Board -- the Court -- Circuit Court in Montgomery Ward stated that we have to give this Act a very broad interpretation because it was involved under the war situation and a liberal interpretation was called for.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.702" offset="13802141">Now, in this case, the Union signs -- I mean, the Union's handbills say -- stated that Old London Products, Rocks Candy, etcetera were products distributed to this store by Servette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.927" offset="13871104">Well, the truth of the matter was that only some of these products were distributed by Servette to some of the stores, that some of these products were distributed to some of these stores by another distributor, certified grocers of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.635" offset="13933902">Now, the Board says, in saying this is still truthful, says you don't have to be 100% truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.829" offset="13958666">But, I submit, Your Honors, that who is being hurt by this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.657" offset="13974026">This other distributor, Certified Grocers, who I'm sure Congress was also trying to protect, having nothing whatsoever to do with the dispute, was having its products not bought or sold because of these signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.727" offset="14034317">Secondly, a manufacturer, who might not even have anything whatsoever to do with Servette, was having his products not bought or sold because of the Union's activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.048" offset="14083532">Any individual store, a particular store was being, in effect, literally picketed or boycotted, having products of it not sold because of the Union's activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.025" offset="14131493">I submit that the truthful qualification that exists in the proviso certainly has not been met in this case, and that every person possible that Congress sought to protect was harmed and, therefore, the proviso does not apply in this case.</text>
