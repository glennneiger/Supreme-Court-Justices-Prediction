            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Doolittle, you may continue your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. William Doolittle</label>
            <text syncTime="11.065" offset="147623">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.438" offset="161102">Petitioner alternatively argues that the effect of Judge Keech's order on remand expunging the final revocation of its clearance from the records, leaves a prior favorable administrative determination in effect, namely that of January 29, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.843" offset="258696">This ingenious argument which does have the virtue of recognizing that a final -- that the final paper for determination must be in administrative one, is we think entirely without substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.685" offset="306134">For one thing, if what petitioner says is true, there would be outstanding, the subsequent unresolved charges or the statement of reasons which is set forth at pages 484 to 486 of this Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.993" offset="367365">More importantly, however, in no sense may Judge Keech's order be read as reinstating the clearance of petitioner that was revoked from such -- such an argument, it would follow that the petitioners is now entitled to access the classified information which he obviously is not, and Judge Keech plainly never intended such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.031" offset="451480">I might note one other incongruity that would result from this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.158" offset="471960">It is clear from paragraph 26 that it is the final favorable determination that closes the interim period for which an individual is entitle to restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.451" offset="525145">Thus, if the 1952 determination marks the end of this interim, petitioner would be entitled to compensation at most for the two months that he was suspended and which suspension was terminated by the favorable determination in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.001" offset="587421">In some, the remedy of paragraph 26 in which the petitioner suit is in part at least based, is in administrative remedy and it must be pursued in the Department of Defense before petitioner has any right to recover under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.390" offset="652936">Now, I shall, as petitioner does, leave to the brief the discussion of the constitutional questions unless this Court has any question that wishes to ask.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="148.781" offset="698493">Very well Mr. Doolittle.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="153.816" offset="718660">Mr. Chief Justice, I only have a few statements to make in concerning this case as to the reasons which we feel compellingly require the interpretation of paragraph 26 in accordance with the way we view that language in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.322" offset="808626">First of all, we are concerned here with solely with a past period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.815" offset="834644">If we are right as to our reading of the final favorable determination of a judicial nature, that determination was made in -- at least in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.836" offset="882709">And we are not concerned with the continuing claim for damages as of today or tomorrow or next week.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.214" offset="920221">We are concerned with a period of time which has elapsed, and during which accrued damages have occurred where there was a cause and infringement of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.494" offset="965360">And I suggest that we must view the -- the damaged claim in light of that -- of those past events which cannot now be undone or re-written nor can there'd be authority invested to do what this Court held, there was no authority for that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.134" offset="1043937">Now, it seems to me that the -- both orally and in the brief, the Government has made a most significant concession in interpreting and applying paragraph 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.660" offset="1098062">Mr. Doolittle correctly states the position that is reflected in his brief on page 14 when he says that the critical determination that they suggest to be made as of today, 1963, relates not to whether he would have been entitled to a security clearance between 1953 and at least 1959, but whether he is eligible as of this very moment which has no relationship to whether or not he should have been entitled to a security clearance during the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.822" offset="1250617">Now, if the justification for the Government's conditioning of monetary restitution under being a final favorable determination is that the Government should not be paying off money to a man who was a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.504" offset="1313416">This interpretation that they suggest does not need that consideration at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.763" offset="1338389">Because as Your Honors have already noted, there is no necessary relationship between a man who is today a security risk but who may not have been a security risk during the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.004" offset="1407352">Indeed, it -- the -- then the only reference that there is in the 1960 regulation to re-examining this past period of time relates to what Mr. Justice Brennan was referring to in the requiring of a finding that the former administrative determination was unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.309" offset="1496586">Now, whatever that word unjustified may mean it completely has dropped out of this case because they state that the Department of Defense has notified it -- the Department of Justice that this kind of a showing will not be required in petitioner's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.581" offset="1573700">They have amended the 1960 regulation to fit Mr. Greene's case and they are not going to read that and try to determine whether former determinations which incidentally were expunged, were unjustified or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.264" offset="1636394">They are concentrating entirely upon whether or not he is as of this moment or as of the time when we make a demand for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.301" offset="1672547">He is then and in the future eligible for access authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.428" offset="1697102">Now, we feel this is completely inequitable and completely unrelated to any concerned or interest of the Government with relation to paying out compensation or past injuries as to which there apparently is never going to be a determination now made as to his then security status.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.146" offset="2059995">And again and as I say, I have not made affirm position on this because the case had not proceeded far enough for the Court of Claims to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.951" offset="2095208">But if we're right that there was any determination of a judicial nature, which was favorable to the petitioner, that certainly was made either in June of 1959 by this Court or by the expunging order of the District Court in the December of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.823" offset="2166680">Now, whether there was be a judicially found to be any extension of that period, I'm not certain but that is a litigable.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.822" offset="2898631">But there is certainly nothing that would be preclude them if -- even if there were something in the regulations, since going beyond them and producing the witnesses, and allowing them to cross examine thereby cutting off any conceivable claim that there was a denial of confrontation or cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.390" offset="2976893">Now, I would like you to refer very briefly to -- well, Mr. Justice Goldberg asked about the opinion in the Silver case and to say that in my judgment, it -- it fully supports the interpretation, the result which we are seeking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.935" offset="3059127">Because the footnote in that case, footnote 18, specifically refers to the general principle of interpretation of statute to regulations or what have you, not a constitutional principle but a general principle that the -- according of their procedures is a fundamental significance and that series an irreversible economic injury may result from their denial, and that a substantive inquiry after the fact cannot possibly succeed inaccurately ascertaining retrospective what the outcome, one of them had procedural safeguards been afforded in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.227" offset="3212309">It seems to me that is, is this case in a nutshell and that we earnestly urge this Court to read, to resolve paragraph 26 once and for all so that this litigation which had been going on now and one form or another or nearly 12, 13 years and finally come to an end so that this petitioner can be made whole for the economic injury which had admittedly been inflicted upon Mr. Greene.</text>
