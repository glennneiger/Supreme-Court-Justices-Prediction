            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Nizer, you may continue your argument.</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_nizer" startTime="3.791" stopTime="625.400">
            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="3.791" offset="118575">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.995" offset="127352">When this suit was instituted, there were 13 alleged discriminations set forth in the complaint ranging from the rejection of allegedly superior offers by Viking in favor of inferior offers by competitors to the failure to screen on days requested or advertising clauses that were different from other advertising clauses but the word "split" never appeared in the complaint as a discrimination or as a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.827" offset="262666">There were seven pretrial conferences resulting in five pretrial orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.871" offset="286908">Not only was there no allegation that splits were per se illegal but an affirmative order was made by the Court on consent at Record 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.605" offset="325778">The question was whether Stanley-Warner-Goldman splits were illegal per se and it was held that they were not, it's abandoned, no longer an issue in this case haec verba.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.918" offset="371022">At the trial, the plaintiff's executive realm was on the stand for 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.626" offset="397876">In all of his specifications of discriminations and grievances, the word "splits" never passed his lips.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.196" offset="436120">Any of the theories that we now have about -- that are now presented about this, of course, could not be cross-examined because they were never even presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.996" offset="471333">Instead, for 42 days, 7700 pages of the record, we were involved in the trial in which on a blackboard, we compare the chief charge that superior offers by Viking were rejected in favor of inferior offers and that became a shambles, the plaintiff out of his own mouth, repeatedly said, "I take it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.544" offset="565582">Now that I see that I'm wrong, cross it off", and we crossed off picture after picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.834" offset="586689">And all of his other alleged discriminations had the same fate and there was nothing left since there was not even a proper of -- fact of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.190" offset="624097">There was nothing left but for a directed verdict at the end of 42 days of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.015" offset="643427">We went to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.371" offset="652831">There, for the first time, although the chief time was taken up on all these alleged discriminations, reviewing them, splits escape their anonymity and were mentioned at least as one of the ways of discrimination from which circumstantial evidence of conspiracy could be spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.945" offset="727124">Judge Biggs allowed a full day of oral argument, requested cross indexes so that the Court could check every exhibit and every bit of testimony and then the Court unanimously wrote a 31 page opinion, which after dissecting the plaintiff's testimony with microscopic care, analyzing each of the distributors' conduct first separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.692" offset="826180">Then referring to the Continental Ore doctrine by name and saying we now look upon the entire matter as an integrated whole and giving every favorable inference to the plaintiff, we find there is no evidence from which a jury could find conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.205" offset="892217">But the Court of Appeals went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.456" offset="901204">It analyzed the new argument that splits were illegal, all the arguments made in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.387" offset="928893">And they found that it was not unlawful, that splits were not unlawful and that the evidence showed no injury to the plaintiff therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.254" offset="964420">Then came the petition of certiorari to this Court and for the first time that was contented that the splits are the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.299" offset="996603">That all the other discriminations flow from it, the phrase used is syllogistically.And splits emerged as the doctrine of law upon which, indeed, if they had believed in it, they could have moved for summary judgment as a question of law instead of trying the case for 42 days without mentioning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.462" offset="1073194">And the company in this concoction in this Court are contrived theories in the brief of submarkets which do not exist in the realistic economic life of this industry, alleged monopolization of submarkets, these non-existent submarkets, monopoly becomes measured by computing theatre seats and incidentally, manipulated so that they multiply the defendants' exhibitor seats by three and divide the plaintiff's seats by three on the theory that the Viking had to enter three submarkets therefore one-third of the seats were competing in each market.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.257" offset="1216449">The theory that by storing up financial resources during the split, the defendant exhibitors were able to give premium offers against the Viking and other semantic and mathematical legit domain about syllogistic inevitability.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.143" offset="1283950">And all these, Your Honor, in this Court, without any record to support it, dismembered from all the evidence, floating in midair, detached from anything in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.618" offset="1329821">Now, when one concocts such a verba, there are 1000 facts which rise to be dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.742" offset="1358346">The new theory that there's -- this is a monopoly case of the submarket runs into the fact that there was an expressed concession cited in page 5 of our brief, that this case does not involve monopoly and no charge of monopoly is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.740" offset="1414353">That position wasn't even changed in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.224" offset="1428250">Section 2, the monopoly statute wasn't even cited among the statutes involved in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.983" offset="1455313">And therefore, the Court of Appeals in its opinion necessarily treated with this simply as a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.287" offset="1480495">The new theory that the defendants through splits, the defendant exhibitors were able to store up finances to make premium office, subsequently runs into the fact that in the trial, the plaintiff's entire burden was to demonstrate that it was the plaintiff that made the premium bids and that they were rejected in favor of non-premium bids, lower bids or offers by his competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.419" offset="1581014">And the new theory that seats are the determining factor in this so-called submarket of monopoly runs into the theory that the plaintiff's insisted at the other end of the spectrum, in the court below, that seats aren't even a factor in determining an evaluation of an offer or a bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.679" offset="1654053">He was asked, supposed a 600 seat theatre competed against Radio City 6000 seats, would the difference in seats be a factor?</text>
            <text syncTime="396.128" offset="1687907">His answer was, "No, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="399.310" offset="1700655">And in the reply brief, after being faced with these references to the self-stultification of the plaintiff, there is no answer to these contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.266" offset="1744436">Now, what are splits and what are their function?</text>
            <text syncTime="414.577" offset="1761677">Due to television impact upon the industry, there was an alarming shrinkage of the number of theatres in this country and also an alarming shortage and reduction of motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.512" offset="1809429">And so there was a shortage of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.660" offset="1821968">And as this Court had occasions, to Mr. Justice Douglas, to say that we will not compel bidding, competitive bidding, when the matter came before you, there was a search for alternative methods, than simply competitive biding.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.222" offset="1880273">And one of the alternatives that grew up in the nation and as the reason for the amicus curiae brief filed by 12,500 theaters in this country opposing the Viking's position, one of the alternative methods was the splitting of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.353" offset="1948818">And as in Philadelphia when there are 12 first-run theatres and only eight companies to feed the 12 mouths, there is a problem of whether these theatres can exist and this -- this is one of the outlets, the relief and ameliorated -- amelioratory process to say particularly the little theatres, the grassroots splitters throughout the country that want the splitting arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.620" offset="2037844">Now, how does the split operate?</text>
            <text syncTime="485.985" offset="2047352">I'm afraid there is some misunderstanding from the pre -- presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.978" offset="2067310">Very rarely, indeed, the record shows never does the distributor put all of these pictures on a split.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.497" offset="2093328">Apparently, he has some special productions and he doesn't wish to put them on, he has a special sales policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.054" offset="2127600">The two exhibitors or there may be more come to the distributor and say, "Would you mind if we didn't compete against each other on your product coming out for the next three months?" And they make a list of pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.770" offset="2178487">No terms, no financial terms, just names.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.474" offset="2193220">And presumably, they divide this list to have parody between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.894" offset="2206908">And the distributor is asked to make the sacrifice of consenting to eliminate the competition between these two for those particular pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.456" offset="2241181">The arrangement is always terminable at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.357" offset="2256750">The distributor makes no commitment to the exhibitor that he will receive the pictures on the split, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.771" offset="2282454">The evidence is conclusive and there's no contradiction of it that the split is always subject to the distributors having the right as he must insist to recoup his money to offer that picture on the split to all other exhibitors in the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.044" offset="2339506">The exhibitor makes no commitment that he'll buy that picture on the split, neither does he.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.546" offset="2357582">Indeed, the exhibitor very often ignores the picture on his own split, not only because it may not turn out to be attractive to him for practical reasons he may not have planned that.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.161" offset="2403976">But above all, the finding of the Court of Appeals and the uniform testimony without contradiction was that no competitor in the territory was affected by pictures being put on the split.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.007" offset="2455385">They all had an opportunity to negotiate a bid for those pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.318" offset="2472626">And indeed, without wishing to trespass on my colleague who will develop this fact, just one statistical fact, I leave the rest to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.949" offset="2507212">The Viking was interested in 87 pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.267" offset="2520482">Of these 48 were on splits.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.313" offset="2532603">The Viking got 17 of these 48 pictures from the split, proof enough that the splits didn't affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.142" offset="2563950">And indeed as Mr. Wolf will demonstrate, Stanley-Warner and Goldman got less pictures on this split than the Viking did of those that the Viking went for.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.400" offset="2605014">Now Viking would get them only as a result of bidding, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="895.770" offset="3686484">He said, "I threw out the suggestion that in the situation as outlined by him, it would seem that one possible solution might be splitting product and told him that we would regard an agreement between exhibitors to split product as improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.064" offset="3747610">But that we had not taken the position it was improper for the distributors in such a situation to advise the exhibitors that they were willing to split their product, as long it was -- as long as it was understood that it was up to the distributors that if they found that it did not work to their best interest, there was nothing to prevent them from changing their policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.571" offset="3845622">And the antitrust division of the Department of Justice took the position in two letters which appear in the annex of Mr. Williams' brief, that splits are legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.528" offset="3905494">Indeed, they requested -- the antitrust division requested several of our companies to consent the splits in certain territories where it might be of aid to the small theatre and we did so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.079" offset="4451662">The so-called Schwalberg Agreement arose out of the effort by one company Paramount to solve the problem with one exhibitor Goldman who stubbornly and on grounds of principle as he felt refused to bid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.857" offset="4526791">When Paramount said this is legal under the Supreme Court decree, Goldman sued Paramount and said, "You are only submitting pictures to me, certain pictures on bid and I say it' illegal”, and he brought suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.395" offset="4580916">The resolution of that suit was the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.076" offset="4603695">That if bids were requested and not very, very rarely or bids or requested on bad pictures or weak pictures but in some certain pictures, if bids were requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.312" offset="4660642">And the bid did not bring in a -- an amount equal to the national -- national film rental requirement which is set in advance, the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.971" offset="4703274">Paramount, as any other company, could reject all bids like an auctioneer who has a $10,000 property and its highest offer is $100.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.602" offset="4993755">The evidence shows that Exhibits D (19) and D (30) which are at 2669 of the record and 2677, that in the very instances where Paramount had rejected this, you will find letters sent to Viking and all others saying, "We invite you to negotiate further with us, to negotiate with each of you".</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.949" offset="5123218">And the Court of Appeals found on the uncontradicted record that actually -- I'll read from the Court of Appeals conclusion after a very detailed analysis of every picture, incidentally, there were only four pictures involved in this entire matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.995" offset="5191346">And not only did the Viking -- was the Viking invited to negotiate but it actually got one of those pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.590" offset="5217782">And that picture was the Gallant -- Lucy Gallant and it's interesting to observe that the terms were of such a nature that Paramount loss $3000 on that picture by paying for advertising and the Viking made a profit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1303.694" offset="5318196">The evidence as a whole failed to completely to support the alleged uniform plan of distribution incorporating terms such as those embodied in the Paramount Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.034" offset="5363545">We are of the opinion that a jury would not be justified in inferring that any distributor other than Paramount, either new of, acquiesced in, or adhered to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.181" offset="5416103">And this is the uncontradicted record in this case, one or two of the instances of pictures which have been cited, there are complete answers on our brief too, they were not -- I regret to say correctly analyzed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.467" offset="5477230">Now I go back to the indicia of the splits and point out in answer to Mr. Justice Goldberg's question that it is uncontradicted that the Viking never requested to be included in the splits but more than that Your Honor, the distributor executive testified that Viking was invited to go into the split and refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.017" offset="5607424">That appears at Record 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.015" offset="5619440">And when Mr. Williams attempted to explain that refusal by saying it was made on the eve of a certain lawsuit that that was an unfortunate error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.650" offset="5661968">The date as appears at Record 1923 is September, 1955, that offer to join the splits and their refusal, September 1955, one year before the suit and before we had any indication that there would be a suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.163" offset="5871992">He was able to compete for a 100% of the product of any company whereas Goldman and Stanley-Warner could only compete for 50% by virtue of the split arrangement they have made between them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.579" offset="6677713">The film rental of the plaintiff's Viking Theatre equates favorably with any of the exhibitor defendants theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.230" offset="6700283">If one eliminates one grievance, one grievous error of judgment made by the plaintiff, that accounts that one picture for 16% of his total film rental, and he conceded in the record that he voluntarily made this bid, the picture was the man with the great rental suit and the Trans-Lux Theatre, another defendant theatre offered a 100,000 guarantee, and then has -- his anxiety to get this picture bid up not by any defendants and not involved in the split.He bid $106,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.256" offset="6828387">This resulted in the disaster to him and he conceded in the record, I would just like to read that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.303" offset="8492596">Before I address the Court on behalf of the exhibitors, Stanley-Warner and Goldman, I beg your permission at the request of Royall, Koegel &amp; Rogers who are counsel for the Fox distributors to make the following statement which they asked me to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.535" offset="8561560">Fox, Philadelphia and Twentieth Century-Fox will not be heard by separate counsel because of this Court's ruling that only two counsels shall be heard for all the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.073" offset="8607640">They rest upon the separate brief which they have filed and the following statements by the Court of Appeals which were fully warranted by the record, and I quote, “The evidence in this case shows that the product of Twentieth Century was available to all exhibitors and was licensed to own the basis of open competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.230" offset="8692276">The plaintiffs did not become interested in Twentieth Century pictures until after March, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.910" offset="8722996">The plaintiff then submitted bids on 15 pictures and of these licensed and exhibited eight just as Mr. Justice Stewart stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.834" offset="8766673">The product of Twentieth Century was licensed picture by picture on a competitive bidding basis except where no bids were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.164" offset="8804080">Its product was not split between Stanley-Warner and Goldman and was apparently made available to all interested exhibitors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.159" offset="8840025">This is from the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.710" offset="8854235">Counsel goes on to say, "Fox, Philadelphia operated only one theatre and was not a party to any split of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.332" offset="8884746">The Viking does not claim that at any superior bid or offer by it was rejected in favor of Fox Philadelphia."</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.180" offset="8920064">That closes the quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.111" offset="8927796">I acquiesce to the position of the Fox respondents and request that there is not time to discuss it further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.504" offset="8957367">I pass on to speak of the charges against Stanley-Warner and Goldman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.814" offset="8978578">Although these charges are in many respects different as to each of them common to both is the charge that there are separate loose agreements with various distributors and with each other terminable at will, the so-called splits were illegal and injured Sley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.970" offset="9055274">As presented to this Court by Mr. Williams, Sley's case bears little resemblance to the case as it was tried so meticulously for 10 weeks in Philadelphia before Mr. Williams came into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.357" offset="9112848">There, Sley's position was not that the splits were illegal, but that the distributors sold Stanley-Warner and Goldman so many pictures for which Sley had made better offers that these sales tended to prove a conspiracy to starve Sley of product and thus bring about his ruin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.080" offset="9199679">Sley's efforts to prove this charge ended in failure and the trial court had no alternative to directing a verdict for the defendants which the Court of Appeals headed by Chief Judge Biggs unanimously affirmed in a careful opinion which analyzed all the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.663" offset="9278046">Now, this Court is told that although on the surface, this case is just another of a hundreds of damaged suits brought by discontented theatre operators to get the Courts, to give them better pictures, they're alert in it heretofore unsuspected legal issues of heavy import, dominant market positions, division of market, monopoly power and that awesome intercontinental ballistic missile of antitrust litigation per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.749" offset="9414405">This heavy artillery is introduced on the theory that the Court's refusal to allow Sley to go to the jury seriously threatens the enforcement of the antitrust laws of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.600" offset="9469785">For us who have been familiar with this case from the beginning, the attempt to create an image of Harry Sley as a modern Henry V, fighting his second Battle of Agincourt against the Mighty Motion Picture Industry makes to say the least a dim impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.009" offset="9543450">The evidence which Sley produced showed that there was no restraint of trade or monopolistic practice to which he or any other exhibitor would suggest was subjected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.951" offset="9591202">No interference with his getting all the pictures to which he was entitled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.021" offset="9667480">This case contest -- concerns not Sley splits in general, but the particular split in this case namely agreements between Stanley-Warner and Goldman consented to by the distributors which not only let Sley free to seek every film that was released but benefited him by reducing the competition he had to meet on those he did bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.197" offset="9776149">The history of the splits begins in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.974" offset="9791300">At that time, Stanley had six first-run houses, Goldman had three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.256" offset="9812407">There was no parody between the number of houses they had as Mr. Williams has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.817" offset="9838634">Goldman had protested continuously by argument and by lawsuits that the sale of pictures by bidding was pre -- prejudicial to him and harmful to the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.523" offset="9889416">As you have heard, 12,500 theatre operators feel the same way about it as Goldman did, and they are asking you to support the view that splits, which are their only remedy against bidding are not illegal provided in no case do they prevent any outsider from bidding just as generously as he could have done if there had been no split and with the added benefit of having only one competitor instead of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.323" offset="10016684">As the result of Goldman's protest, MGM, Stanley -- and Stanley-Warner agree in 1951 that Stanley-Warner and Goldman, each would seek only one half of the pictures which MGM was willing to have split.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.041" offset="10087528">Both Stanley-Warner and Goldman understood clearly and never questioned that the arrangement in no way was to interfere with MGM's right to solicit any other customers they had wanted or any in the pictures it had, and in no way bound MGM to sell the pictures Stanley-Warner or to Goldman or bound them to buy any of MGM's pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.934" offset="10187107">By the spring of 1953, other distributors individually had consented in principle to substantially similar arrangements in every case preserving their freedom of action with regard to selling their pictures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2734.654" offset="11041938">The -- all -- all of the splits had been arranged as has been said openly and above board and every one of them before Sley ever was dreamed of as a theatre owner or operator in Central Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.477" offset="11109230">As far as the respondents were concerned, Sley wasn't even born when these splits were arranged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.167" offset="11136084">Now, I'll tell you how he came into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.196" offset="11148204">By 1953, due to the impact of radio and television as Mr. Nizer has said, there were not enough quality pictures released to supply all of the theatres seeking them in Central Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.060" offset="11203584">Goldman had given -- I mean Stanley-Warner had given up two of its six theatres and it still could not get enough products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.817" offset="11238588">So it decided that in order to help the other theatres it had -- it would sell the Alden Theatre which was the poorest of its four remaining houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.450" offset="11289161">For obvious reasons, he didn't intend to sell the property to anyone who would use it as a picture house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.647" offset="11318000">Sley, a well known garage and parking lot operator offered to buy the property for remodeling as he said into a garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.524" offset="11361468">Relying on this expression of Sley's purpose, Stanley-Warner sold the property to him and he carrying out what had been his concealed purpose from the beginning, fixed it up, gave it a belligerent name of the ancient North Sea pirates Viking and became one of 12 city houses, seeking first-run pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.302" offset="11460629">If Sley charges, the respondents had entered into a conspiracy to sabotage his operation from the date he opened, one would have expected them to try to choke him off before he got joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.539" offset="11521546">Following Brutus' advised to Julius Caesar, think him as a serpent's egg which hatched, would as his kind, grow mischievous and kill him in his shell.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.644" offset="11585912">If they didn't sell -- if they didn't kill Sley, on the contrary for his opening, Sley got exactly the picture he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.594" offset="11625723">The Student Prince, got it from MGM, the outstanding company in the business, although in fact, the picture was on Goldman's side of the split.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.615" offset="11665847">And from that time until this suit was brought, despite the shortage of product, Sley continuously got first-run pictures from the very distributors and now sues as conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.316" offset="11720600">During that entire period, he never complained to Stanley-Warner or Goldman and their first knowledge that they too were supposed to be conspirators because when they got the complaint in this case, the history of how well Sley faired when his path crossed theirs in seeking pictures explains why he hadn't complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.775" offset="11814431">During the two and a quarter years involved in the action, the Philadelphia exhibitors played 468 pictures of which Sley made some effort to buy 87.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.753" offset="11866363">As to the other 381, any or all of which, Sley was at perfect liberty to see -- Sley's counsel stated frankly in their brief and the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.670" offset="11914010">There were some hundreds of pictures on which plaintiffs elected not to bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.504" offset="11937416">Sley selected only 87 because of the entire 468, they were the only ones that he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.980" offset="11971271">As to these, Sley does not deny that the door was opened to him at the trial as far as the door can be opened, to put in every particle of evidence which he wanted to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.462" offset="12021217">These pictures were diagnosed, x-rayed, psychoanalyzed, (Inaudible) -- postmortem and quartered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.566" offset="12049638">And this is why they merged.Of the 87, Sley got 37 for the Viking, Stanley-Warner and Goldman together got 36 or six for each of their six houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.095" offset="12111705">Now if Sley had any complaint against Stanley-Warner or Goldman, it must be about the 36 pictures they got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.921" offset="12143052">He certainly could not complain to Stanley-Warner or Goldman about the 37 pictures he himself got, nor could he complain about the 14 pictures which neither he or Stanley-Warner, nor Goldman got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.468" offset="12201253">So we now consider whether those 36 pictures were sold to Stanley-Warner and Goldman in this regard of Sley's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.465" offset="12241272">In this case there was no direct proof of the conspiracy not even the conventional evidence of clandestine meetings, secret conversations, confidential letters or a loose talk in which some blundering salesmen at a bibulous party made damaging admissions about a plot against Sley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.149" offset="12327999">The only circumstantial evidence which could be of probative value would be evidence that the conspirators frequently according to a discernible pattern of conduct sold pictures to the favorite exhibitors on terms so much less advantageous than Sley's offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.735" offset="12406262">That a reasonable person would think that they had a malicious and deliberate purpose to deprive Sley of pictures to which he was entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.661" offset="12450043">In the brief -- in the Court of Appeals, this was the claim that was made.Viking's bids offering terms superior to those proposed by the defendant exhibitors were routinely rejected if they were the defendant exhibitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.622" offset="12513886">In support of this, Sley charged that 25 of the 36 pictures which Stanley-Warner and Goldman got were sold to them although Sley had made superior bids with these 25 pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.339" offset="12576684">The fantastic way in which Sley tried to prove this case in the lower court was so much riddled on cross examination of his witness that he was compelled to admit the judge by his results with other pictures, Sley's bids were inferior to those of Stanley-Warner and Goldman on these 25 pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.871" offset="12670830">Sley does not any longer argue here that the licensing of these pictures, the Stanley-Warner and Goldman was dishonest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.145" offset="12707924">His change of front in this Court forced him to this surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.630" offset="12725896">In the lower court and in the Court of Appeals, Sley had taken the position that the greater seating capacity of the Stanley-Warner and Goldman Theatres over Viking was not a factor at all which justified the distributors in deciding to sell their pictures to those houses rather than the Viking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.755" offset="12814399">Sley's manager, as Mr. Nizer has said, testified emphatically that the greater number of seats was absolutely no factor in determining the grossing ability of the theatres as proven he said, by the fact that the Stanley Warner's 4000 seat may as bound had to be taken down because they couldn't fill the seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.600" offset="12917739">In his brief in the Court of Appeals on which I see Mr. Williams name, appears the famous Footnote 72 on page 48 although the Mastbaum had 4378 seats to the Viking's 1017, the extra seats were a liability rather than an asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.102" offset="13007809">Stanley-Warner's president admitted that the Mastbaum was obsolete in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.486" offset="13037275">So, when Mr. Williams came up with his new theory that the great seating capacity of the Stanley-Warner and Goldman houses gave them buying power amounting almost to monopoly, he ran head on into Sley's prior contrary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.040" offset="13107493">He then was faced with the alternative of agree -- arguing that the sale of pictures to Stanley-Warner and Goldman were not justified because as Sley had asserted, their seating capacity was no factor in calculating their gross ability or of contradicting Sley and admitting that the sales were justified because seating capacity was of vital decisive factor than grossing ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.438" offset="13225148">He took the latter view and abandoned Sley's position that the great seating capacity with Stanley-Warner and Goldman did not justify the awards of pictures to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.019" offset="13271437">But where did this leave Sley?</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.600" offset="13281782">If Stanley-Warner and Goldman got it -- the only pictures which Sley also wanted for legitimate business reasons, what ground was left for complaints by Sley?</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.938" offset="13327130">None.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.280" offset="13332459">Thus left high and dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.406" offset="13341027">Sley conceded in his brief in this Court frankly that if his evidence of conspiracy was limited to the 87 pictures which he wanted, "he could not give a coherent statement of the conspiracy."</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.378" offset="13408841">In this crisis, Sley made his offers in the trial court to include evidence about the 371 pictures which he had elected not to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.233" offset="13460355">These offers were considered carefully by the Court of Appeals and found to contain no matter of probative value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.736" offset="13490343">For this finding, the Court of Appeals is held up to this Court as both ignorant and prejudice, terms which sound to us who are familiar with that Court as singularly inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.876" offset="13550843">The first offer was to show that Viking got a disproportionately small number of films with high national film rentals over $3 million and that this was viewed of the dominant, economic market power of the exhibitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.575" offset="13613641">Let us see.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.233" offset="13620328">During the two and a quarter years, there were 55 such pictures released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.233" offset="13644257">Of this 55, 20 were among the 87 which Vikings sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.848" offset="13670797">Of those 20, Viking got two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.075" offset="13683649">And Stanley-Warner and Goldman 10 for their six houses less than two a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.314" offset="13712593">One of Sley's by the way was not as a stranger, a very tough $6 million which was on Stanley-Warner side of the split, was bid for by Stanley-Warner, and nevertheless was sold to Sley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.364" offset="13776854">So, there were 35 of these pictures which Sley did not seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.639" offset="13797961">Since Sley did not seek any of them of course, he didn't get any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.725" offset="13818232">But nevertheless, he claims that the fact that Stanley-Warner and Goldman who did seek them, got many of them, was probative value of the conspiracy against him and to benighted Third Circuit made an egregious error in not considering it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.329" offset="13892733">This raises interesting questions as to Sley's mental processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.999" offset="13915408">In order to avoid a charge of conspiracy, thus Sley suggests that the distributors and Stanley-Warner or Goldman had to go to see him and inquire whether it would be satisfactory to him if the distributors sold these pictures which he had not sought to Stanley-Warner or Goldman, and whether the terms proposed were alright with Sley, and if Sley did not approve that in his view that the distributor should bury the pictures in the ground and kill Sley, either sought them for himself or graciously change his mind and allow the sale to be made to Stanley-Warner or Goldman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.648" offset="14081964">His second offer was to prove that Stanley-Warner and Goldman got many more rental adjustments than he got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.352" offset="14112789">Of these, an insignificant number, we're on the 381, were -- were all (Inaudible) insignificant number, were on the 381 in which he was not interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.455" offset="14161168">On the 87 in which he was interested, he faired better than Stanley-Warner or Goldman did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.817" offset="14186663">Why adjustments were granted in this particular case would require a separate trial as to each picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.547" offset="14213517">But, we come back to the underlying inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.401" offset="14225011">Did the respondents always owe Sley a duty to allow him to decide when adjustments should be granted and in what amounts even in the case of pictures which he didn't want?</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.892" offset="14274957">Finally, Sley offered to show and Stanley-Warner and Goldman played more pictures than he did, that the national film rental of their pictures was more, that he had to play his pictures longer, that he had to pay more for them, always he had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.463" offset="14337233">Why did he have to?</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.596" offset="14345801">He -- why -- with a hundred and -- with 468 pictures released, why did he seek only 87 of them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.102" offset="14379760">If there were 59 $3 million pictures released, why did he pass up 39 of them?</text>

            <text syncTime="3628.983" offset="14619355">With Freudian forgetfulness, Sley, in setting out the statutes involved in his brief, omitted any reference to Section 4 of the Clayton Act on which his entire right of recovery depends and he now sees himself not as a plaintiff in an ordinary private antitrust case, but as an ad hoc deputy, protecting the Attorney General and speaking on behalf of all the citizens of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3751.151" offset="15107950">Nor can Sley complain of the fact that these two people did not compete when he was not in the field himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="4243.700" offset="17078209">Now, the question was asked toward the very end of Mr. Wolf's statement, well, what about Goldman?</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.760" offset="17106422">Did Goldman know what the bids were?</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.876" offset="17118856">Plan -- the distributor came to him after rejecting all the bids and Mr. Wolf answered quite categorically.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.040" offset="17151561">No, Mr. Goldman didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.925" offset="17159084">Well, let's see what the record says on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.435" offset="17169115">At page 1716, Volume 4, Goldman said, he could figure out what the bids were once they were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.558" offset="17201612">At page 1606 and 1607, Volume 4, Mr. Minsky of Stanley-Warner, said in the negotiations, the distributor would say what he wanted for the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.584" offset="17253752">Mr. Mansell of Warner Bros. said, the negotiation started with something better than the rejected bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.238" offset="17284368">So Mr. Goldman didn't have to have clairvoyance to figure out what he had to bid in order to get the picture and bar the Viking from getting a chance to get it after he made his offer when they in the first instance had been the only exhibitor in the Philadelphia area, willing to make a competitive bid against the other distributors for or other exhibitors for a picture on the Goldman side of the market.</text>
