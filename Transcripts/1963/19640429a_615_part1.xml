            <text syncTime="181.997" offset="832428">On January 30th, a Saturday evening, about 8 o'clock, Danny was at his sister's home, his -- the widow of the deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.987" offset="876314">At that time, several police officers came with warrants for the arrest of Danny and his sister.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.355" offset="957816">While they were taking Danny to police headquarters, one of the officers said, "We've got evidence that you did the killing or somebody says that you shot your brother-in-law."</text>
            <text syncTime="225.777" offset="1007553">And Danny denies this.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.716" offset="1071292">About 9 o'clock or so or 9:30, the testimony of the police officers is in conflict, they arrived at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.904" offset="1112043">Danny was then taken to one room, Bobby Chan taken to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.142" offset="1132941">By the way, Bobby Chan had been rearrested separately and was placed in a room adjacent to Danny.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.430" offset="1202113">He had been informed, the record is silent as to how, that Danny and Bobby had been taken there but nonetheless, he came to the police station.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.389" offset="1261986">He was told, "Well, they haven't been here very long.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.790" offset="1283511">”He was told by one police officer that "You'll have to see somebody else," and he was shunted around from one detective to another in the Homicide Division.</text>
