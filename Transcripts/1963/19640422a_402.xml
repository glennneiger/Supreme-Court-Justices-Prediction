            <label>Mr. Walter S. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="36.944" offset="251173">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.886" offset="266951">This action was commenced by the filing of a respondent's complaint on November 13, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.748" offset="298402">In that complaint and with an attendant order to show cause, the plaintiff respondent sought an injunction to restrain the corporation and that -- and the then five individual defendant directors from taking further action to or towards the consummation of a merger of the American Tractor Corporation into J. I. Case Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.513" offset="401429">He also sought to have any merger declared void.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.204" offset="420237">The application for the temporary injunction was denied by the trial court, namely Dis -- District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin and no appeal was taken from that denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.258" offset="472377">The defendants at that point, petitioners before this Court, sought to have this case moved ahead for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.647" offset="513964">The respondent resisted having the case brought on, pleading that he had to engage in discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.010" offset="543431">And that if any damages were inflicted upon the Company by delaying the consummation of the merger, that those damages would be self-inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.238" offset="588361">Accordingly, the Corporation proceeded to consummate the merger of ATC into the J. I. Case Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.654" offset="629948">Now, the respondent, it proceed with extensive discovery, and eventually filed a -- an amended and supplemental complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.038" offset="671535">The trial court at that point, upon motion of the de -- defendant -- the corporate defendant, J. I. Case Company, ordered that the respondent post $75,000 as security for expenses, as a condition to the proceeding with the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.510" offset="761396">What the trial court did was apply the statute of Wisconsin, a security for expense statute which was considered at length by this Court in Cohen versus the Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation in 337 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.943" offset="843107">The respondent did not post the security.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.087" offset="863692">The -- the orders gave him alternatives to join other plaintiffs, do other things, and the matter laid at rest at that point until the respondent filed a second amended and supplemental complaint and then a third amended and supplemental complaint which he filed with the consent of the Court on the representation that he would turn the action into one to solely vindicate his preemptive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.552" offset="1013530">In other words, that he would turn the case from a derivative lawsuit to which the statute, the Wisconsin statute applies, he would turn it from a derivative lawsuit into a primary claim of the stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.432" offset="1073089">Now, it will be noted that the third amended complaint which is before this Court in -- at this time is before the Court almost as if there had been a demurrer to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.706" offset="1122200">No answer has been filed to this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.951" offset="1131186">There has been no testimony, no evidence, there's been no findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.680" offset="1150098">We take this complaint as a verity for the purposes of -- of this discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.239" offset="1188342">The complaint is in two counts - Count one is a count which alleges a violation of the stockholders of the Case Company's preemptive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.294" offset="1256573">The trial court, the Eastern District of Wisconsin, reviewed that count one, said that the amendment was insufficient to disguise it or turn it from a derivative cause of action and ordered the respondent to post security for a cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.812" offset="1346644">This ruling on appeal to the Seventh Circuit was overturned and we may move count one aside for the purposes of discussion before this Court because no appeal was taken or no question was raised about the Seventh Circuit reversing the trial court on count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.975" offset="1435251">Count two on the other hand attempts to touch a federal question and that is the face of the case that is here on certiorari today.</text>
