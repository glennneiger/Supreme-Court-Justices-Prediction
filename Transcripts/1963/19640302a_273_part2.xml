            <text syncTime="204.846" offset="922728">Unless they think they can support it on the basis of their individual costs, now let's forget what those individual cost may be, the point being it will justify the price and they won't even come in at the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.650" offset="1037981">Two different things, the Commission can't really know anymore than we know whether a price presence that is just and reasonable today will be just and reasonable then and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.605" offset="1081762">So, this thought that the Commission by preventing these filings or any access at all to the rate change provisions to Section 4, can thereby freeze prices indefinitely at -- in their sole discretion is I believe unethical to the purpose of the Act as written by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.898" offset="1190954">Let me say a word about this decision of December 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.089" offset="1215718">In that case, we held with respect to the certificates in this area, the earlier ones before September 20, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.195" offset="1260126">That the Commission had been mistaken fixing an 18 cent guideline price and that the proper inline price was 16 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.637" offset="1293876">We do allow them under that permanent certificate within the limits of their contract to file between 16 cents and 19 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.824" offset="1330657">But we've said we will not allow them to file above 19 cents because that -- as we figured it out is the triggering price in this area as of today.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="322.616" offset="1393873">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.861" offset="1394813">It was a particular contracts but we discover -- we made the findings on the escalation from these pricing areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.145" offset="1423966">Now, the only reason that the contracts in issue with here were not also given an inline price of 16 cents was that the Commission said, the inline price as of September 20th, 1960 was 16 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.012" offset="1491466">But your contracts were made three months later and we will give you an option of showing in a further proceeding that in fact that the Commission fixed an 18 cent price somehow affected the inline price.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.416" offset="1545070">In the meantime, we can collect 18 cents but we didn't cut them back immediately to 16 cents of the inline price.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.777" offset="1578506">We're giving these people an option to show that the inline price should be higher because of the effect, if any, of the Commission setting an 18 cent price on September 20th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.532" offset="1629497">Now, this gets I think to the problem I want to end with which is the temporary authority that's asked here and the peculiar problems that we're faced with there.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.068" offset="1683623">This Court told us in CATCO that we have to fix an inline price and whatever the difficulties may be, we have to fix it after a statutory hearing in which not only the Commission but all consumer elements can be allowed into the proceeding to decide and argue what they think the inline price is.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.328" offset="1768678">But this particular case comes up one step earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.408" offset="1781008">It comes up at the preliminary period when we know we're going to have to have a hearing before we can grant any permanent certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.971" offset="1815280">And these people I asked for a temporary certificate so they can get over an emergency period.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.566" offset="1841612">Now, I think it can be argued that the Commission could say for temporary purposes, "We're going to give you a relatively low rate which will give you some money but we don't have to give you anything close to what we think the proper guideline is.”</text>
            <text syncTime="448.082" offset="1895737">But the Commission hasn't done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.492" offset="1901380">The Commission has said, "We'll allow somebody coming in at this temporary period, the full guideline price with which we would be agreed to certificate this thing if there is no consumer opposition."</text>
            <text syncTime="461.995" offset="1951326">But we won't give you anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.974" offset="1963238">Now, whatever the justification might be and whatever the Commission need to find in a way of findings after a hearing to make conditions on a permanent certificate, it seems to make clear that when people come in and ask not for a right, they have a right to a hearing under Section 7 (e) of the Act if they can show that it's in the public interest and convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.024" offset="2067519">But they have no right to a temporary grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.243" offset="2076296">This is -- well, all discretion is limited by reasonableness of course but, this is an area in which the Commission's discretion on reasonableness is very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.044" offset="2123525">And the Commission says, if you want start proceedings, before we can have the determination as to what the inline rate is, then, we are going to give you no more than this set figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.558" offset="2181622">If you don't want to start at that, this gas isn't worth it because, the only basis upon which it's worth all the while to allow you to start initially, before we can have a statutory hearing to determine what the Court said we have to fix the inline price in CATCO is at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.931" offset="2263124">Now, as I say, if we fix a much lower price, in 18 cents, I think it was -- been our -- with our power.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.426" offset="2293112">And when in fact we set a price of 18 cents which turns out to be two cents more than the guideline was three months, then the inline price was three months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.172" offset="2332087">I don't think these people can properly claim that we're being unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.590" offset="2349746">On the contrary, the Commission if anything has leaned over back to ensure that producers can get into the market at a price near the top of the market before anybody else has a chance to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.148" offset="2419963">And they can't complain about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.725" offset="2434278">If they get in and they want to get out, they have to ask us to get out.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.719" offset="2450265">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.675" offset="2454026">They can abandon without coming to.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.830" offset="2470640">But this isn't a risk which means that they have the right to charge more than we're entitled but we want to give them during this error period.Of course, as they get in and a pipeline is dependent upon this gas, we're going to have to have them show us what the effect of getting out with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.943" offset="2547127">But to say that abandonment is impossible under these circumstances as far from correct what really is the fact is that nobody has even sought to abandon once they've gotten in.</text>
