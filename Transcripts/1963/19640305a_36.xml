            <text syncTime="16.813" offset="170611">At the close of the session yesterday there had been two questions asked to me, which I would like to briefly augment my answer to at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.023" offset="231424">Mr. Justice Brennan enquired as to whether or not the Justice Department had gotten in touch with the bank in any way prior to the actual merger of the banks and you will recall that I said that January the 10th, we had a received a letter from the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.429" offset="309060">Now in background of that, very briefly, the application for merger was filed on the first day of December of 1960 and in that the banks asked for permission to merge on January 17th of the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.175" offset="376038">All of the necessary approval of the stockholders and the Board of the Directors was had early in the history of that matter and on the 10th day of January the bank received a letter from the Department of Justice in which they informed us first that their report to the Comptroller had been adverse on the question of the competitive affects of the merger itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.839" offset="550745">What they further advised us was though to this effect and I'd like to quote from the letter, the Department also advised that in view of the serious anticompetitive effects of which this consolidation may have on the Lexington area and in response to a number of complaints made to the Department in connection with the matter, it has initiated an investigation to determine whether such consolidation would create any violation of the Federal Antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.014" offset="671431">In other words, that had -- they had not determined that Question - which is the one before us and the letter continued, “as soon as this investigation is completed we will inform you as to what, if any, action the Department intends to take with respect to the consolidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.501" offset="769337">Weeks went by and we heard nothing and finally on the 24th of February we were advised by a telephone call from the Comptroller's office that the merger had been approved and from that we assume that whatever difficulties there were had been ironed out in our case and we then asked the Comptroller for permission to merge on the first day of March.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.184" offset="888142">On the 25th of February the same -- the following day after we had received that communication and I might note that on the 24th the Philadelphia bank was also notified of their right to consolidate in the opinion of the Comptroller, the following day the government filed its suit in Philadelphia, on the 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.216" offset="984273">But the time progressed and on until the 1st of March and we in answer your question Mr. Justice Brennan, we received no information by telephone, letter, otherwise, none at all, and so we proceeded to merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.984" offset="1043310">The first information we had that the Justice Department was going to take any action upon us was after the suit was filed when the United States Marshall served the summons on the President of the Bank –</text>

            <text syncTime="307.471" offset="1333269">That would have probably depended on the whether the Court state a temporary injection or not, but the Court would have an opportunity to have sustained such an injection if the suit had been filed before we merged.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.527" offset="1381439">In the sense it was filed after we merged, the two banks had gone out of existence, they could -- they didn't have charters to operate as individual banks anymore the only way they could operate was as merged banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.643" offset="1429922">And so the Court ordered and we agreed, so they are only saying that we could do under those circumstances, which was to try to the best of our ability to keep the separate records and I won't make that clarification of what I stated yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.625" offset="1493870">Now, I'd like to address myself to what I consider to be the real and possibly almost the only question for this Court in this case and that is the question as to and it's a question which was decided a question of fact, which was decided on the evidence by the Trial Court, namely that the evidence presented at the trail of this action, did not sustain the position of a violation of Section 1 or Section 2 of Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.531" offset="1633468">Now, unless the decision of the Trial Court on that issue of fact was clearly erroneous then it should be affirmed and in order to be able to answer that Question, I see no escape from discussing the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.176" offset="1712044">The distinguished counsel for the government said that he was pitching or placing their case on the testimony of three live witnesses who appeared at the trial of the case, the only witnesses introduced by the government and the statistics which were in the form of the exhibits, that is the total of the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.842" offset="1806712">Now, the testimony of these three live witnesses, who were Presidents of other local banks in Lexington, did not go so far as to say on the basis of expert opinion that this merger would and had created an unreasonable restraint on trade and commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.881" offset="1914859">All that they said and as this was found by the Trail Court and the records sustains it, all that they said in effect was, that they were apprehensive or they feared that it might put their banks in a position where it would be more difficult for them to compete which is a long way from saying as a matter of fact that in their opinion it did constitute an unreasonable restrain for trade as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.794" offset="2030529">But they gave no facts on which to support, even their fears and their apprehensions and I had the opportunity to cross examine those gentlemen.</text>

            <text syncTime="801.122" offset="3307813">The Trial Judge, in his opinion, stated as follows and this is the record page 1249.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.105" offset="3355773">In addition to statistical facts shown by the numerous exhibits filed the plaintiffs introduced as witnesses to sustain its contention only in the presence of three local banks who expressed considerable fear that the consolidation would result in serious loss to other banks and would be disastrous to some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.482" offset="3433305">The testimony given by these witnesses seems based merely upon surmise and he is lacking in factual support.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.201" offset="3468204">Now that comment by the Trial Judge in this case is very similar to the language used by this Court in the opinion in the Philadelphia case in which a similar type of testimony was being discussed by this Court and in which Mr. Justice Brennan in writing the opinion of the Court stated, there was to be sure testimony by bank officers to the effect that competition among banks in Philadelphia was vigorous and would continue to be vigorous after the merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.458" offset="3801213">Now, in addition to the testimony of those three live witnesses which was based not merely their fear and apprehension, a conclusion upon which they gave no facts whatsoever to support and which this Court has said was therefore entitled to little weight, we have the statistics offered by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.281" offset="3892537">Most of the voluminous exhibits filed by the government were addressed to problems which no longer exist, such as what was the relative market and should competition with other lending agencies be involved and things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.966" offset="3955231">So really the only statistical evidence which bore on this particular problem was the statistical evidence which show that following the merger in excess of 50% of the banking assets of the community would be in the hands of the merged bank and also the exhibit with reference to the concentration in the trust field.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.313" offset="4064632">Now, the government's statistics and figures directed themselves to what existed on one particular day only, there was no expert testimony offered as to the affect of that concentration on competition in Lexington, Kentucky, there -- no expert was introduced, no attempt made in evidence to explain them or to deduce anything from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.556" offset="4249579">There are no figures available as of the first of March and so they took the figures for two months in advance of that which was the, were the year end figures and it's based on 1960, end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.835" offset="4318751">Now, as apposed to that the defendants offered exhibits which show not only the exist -- the condition which existed on a day two months prior to this merger, but showed number one what had happened in the way of competition between these banks in Lexington for the year's operation, 10 months of which was after the merger had taken place, to see what effect on competition the merger had had in Lexington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.965" offset="4479248">The proof on that show that that the time of the merger or two months in advance thereof that the merged bank held 52.7% of the total resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.430" offset="4541106">And after a year had elapsed in competition between the merged bank and the other existing banks that figure had gone down to 51%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.299" offset="4608606">Now that in itself might not be too significant except if you consider it in the light of what had happened before in the same community, Lexington community, under the same circumstances where the lead bank had in that case more than 52% they had 53% plus of the banking assets and that was the condition in 1942 in Lexington, the First National Bank at that time held 53.7% of all deposits in Lexington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.814" offset="4742666">11 years later in competing with the bank holding that amount of concentration, the smaller banks had been able to compete so well that they had grown much more rapidly than the lead bank and the lead bank's concentration or possession of assets had then dropped to 38.7% and so you can sometimes foretell a situation by what has happened in the past and you can examine the situation in the light of what has happened in the past under practically identical circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1225.462" offset="5005249">There the lead bank had held 75% of the banking assets and in 15 years that shrank under competition with the other banks to 59%, looking to the south at Chattanooga, Tennessee, there the lead bank had held 61%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.569" offset="5097618">And in competition over a short period of time with the other banks that dropped to 52%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.538" offset="5133563">To our west, Louisville, Kentucky, that's a larger than Lexington, but it's the first large city you come to and is the closest want to us, there the lead bank and held at 63% and in competition with that bank the other banks in a short period of time were able to cut that down to 53%.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.333" offset="5512756">And in those 122 cities, 66 of those cities or more than half of them the lead bank hell more than 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.593" offset="5557791">In 122, out of those 122 cities 35 of them, the lead bank held more than 60%, and in 47 of the others the lead bank was between 35% and 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.249" offset="5616410">Now, for Lexington to have a lead bank with 50% where more than half of the other cities of the United States of comparable size have lead banks of having more than 50% seems to us to show that it is not unreasonable because it's not on unusual it's the norm that is the average situation which exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.460" offset="5721213">Government has suggested that the question of reasonable be determine on the basis of Tort law and there it's what is usual and customary and what do you expect to find and that is the situation in -- throughout the United States and cities of comparable size to Lexington, Kentucky and so we say that those figures are very indicative themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.504" offset="5961435">In 29 of the cities as compared to four, the percentage went substantially down and so with -- those figures are indicative and are a basis for the Trial Court's finding in this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.143" offset="9411897">Your honor I think that's exactly correct, I believe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.690" offset="9426108">I said I wanted to, I see my time is almost up, I certainly want to talk something about the, this Trust situation, and I'll do just briefly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.798" offset="9462575">Trust situation in Lexington enrolls in a rather unusual manner in that the Security Trust Company for a long time was the only corporation which offered corporate trust services and their clients were other banks, the other banks helped to form it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.719" offset="9538226">And they held 100% of the corporate fiduciary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.702" offset="9562154">Proof shows that about 20 years ago with the First National Bank decided to go into the trust business and they were able to compete successfully and obtain a substantial portion of the trust business against a bank which had a 100% to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.538" offset="9637491">Now, the real competition in the trust business is the competition against individual appointments because by far the great percentage of appointments in Fayette County for trustees are various types are individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.391" offset="9748982">Over a 21 year period -- we made a study, over a period of 21 years, individuals received 91% of the trust apartments, so there is the place where trust business must come from and where you must compete in order to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.263" offset="9820453">Trust business is also a little different from the business where the -- the business continues and you get the same customer over and over again as you do in a shoe store for example because once you are appointed as a trustee for all practical purposes there is no competition between banks to take that appointment or that particular trust away from one bank that has it and gave it to another one, and so it's in a -- really in an entirely different field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.534" offset="9937481">The testimony in this case un-contradicted that kind of concentration since you are only competing for a new business and not against each other for the business you already have, that holding that percentage is no detriment to competition, it doesn't keep another bank from competing that has been born out by the fact that this record that in – since just shortly before this merger took place, the other banks who had formally not even been interested in getting trust business went into the field and have been able to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.511" offset="10109367">We brought an expert who said that that was perfect, natural, and normal because it's, if I may use a home illustration, it's kind of like going fishing and you arrive at the pond a little late and there is that fellow that's already caught a pile of fish, you don't catch the fish but ones – and the fact he already has in there are the ones he has got, doesn't keep you from being in just as good position to catch fish from there on out as he is and I think it's comparable to the situation in the trust business, not in other businesses where you continue and you compete for the business the other man already has, you don't do that in the trust business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.824" offset="10250637">Now there has been some intimation in the record and by counsel for the government that the First National arrived at its size by previous mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.719" offset="10306226">And I would like to call this to the Court's attention and this is substantiated in the record, the 12 mergers or takeovers or whatever you want to call them which the First National Bank had previously had, many of them by the way were where banks were about to go under and -- well the last one in 1929, the Fayette National Bank was in difficulty and the government asked the First National to take it – that bank over so that the depositors wouldn't lose their deposits. But after all those 12 had been accomplished 30 years ago and there has been none since, the First National Bank was only $11 million bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.875" offset="10490859">It only had assets of $11 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.097" offset="10499741">So it did not get its growth from those mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.755" offset="10514369">The Security Trust Company had had no previous merger before this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.822" offset="10534640">I have -- my time up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.280" offset="10832541">And he answered in the middle of the page, “Well as I said a minute ago, I think the treasurers of National Corporations are unduly influenced by size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.001" offset="10871411">It was difficult enough with the largest bank in town having 40% of deposits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.393" offset="10892936">In other words he said that even before the merger they were having trouble competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.373" offset="10912893">I think it will be that much more difficult with the largest bank having between 52% and 53% of the deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.490" offset="10945285">I think it is a sort of progressive influence and then previous to that on Page 199, he had echoed this thought, made it a little earlier when he was asked what effects will the increased size of the consolidated bank have on the ability of your bank to compete and his answer is the long paragraph at the bottom of the page and that halfway through that quotation he said, “My experience in soliciting accounts of national concerns is that size has a tremendous influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.793" offset="11090526">It is hard to understand it, but it does on the decisions of treasures of national corporations as to the bank of their choice in a community where they have a branch or an operation of some kind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.803" offset="11138591">And he went on and he said, “There are also -- there are certain local people who wanted to do business with the biggest institution.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.423" offset="11277040">He said, about the sixth or seventh line, Mr. Clarke stated, “I have stated all through my testimony that my apprehension is over the long run not the immediate effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.199" offset="11332211">And we think that in this record there is clear and definite proof, testimony by these other bankers giving facts as to the reason why they would be under a competitive disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.104" offset="11379754">Now to us it in no way refutes that testimony because bankers in other cities, not Lexington, bankers in other cities testified that in their view they did not have any difficulties, they are competing with a larger bank, because we don't know what the situation is and it seems that if witnesses testify to a certain situation in city A, it's quite immaterial we think that witnesses in another city testify that there they do not have the adverse affect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2872.437" offset="11593122">First of all at the present time -- at that time there was no indication that the largest bank First Security had anywhere near this percentage of the trust business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.099" offset="12035741">So that the problem is a recurring problem and if in fact, if in fact the confirmation of the merger, the day before, hours before, conceivably minutes before the government files its suit means that this the end of any relief, it just seems to me an impossible situation, but I like to come to this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.655" offset="12121945">First of all as my opponent has conceded, these people received letters on the 10th of January approximately a month-and-a-half before the merger that the government had told the Comptroller of the Currency that the merger would have an adverse effect on competition and that we were further looking into it and we also had told that we had recommended it be disapproved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.436" offset="12409083">Now I think it's very significant in this connection, what happened on the motion for the preliminary injunction?</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.013" offset="12439385">We filed the motion the day after we filed the suit and in supporting papers we set forth at considerable detail at pages 23 to 33 of the record affidavits by various local bankers as to the difficulties, the difficulties that would exist if after consummation there had to be divestiture, we recognize it will be difficult, but we don't think it's anywhere near impossible, it will be difficult and our opponents here opposed that motion and the -- we think this record makes it quite clear that both the District Court and the appellees recognized that if the government ultimately should prevail in this suit that they would have to separate these banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.649" offset="12633945">I would like to invite the Court's attention to two passages in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.357" offset="12652753">The first is at page 43, about four-fifths of the way down, the last statement of the Court, and the Court says there, these people have had ample notice that your suit has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.751" offset="12714402">They have had ample notice of what the results maybe if they continue to carry out a so called merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.630" offset="12737912">They would have to stand the damage that would be occasioned by having to make a segregation of all assets that are commingled, that was the Court speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.653" offset="12778036">Then at page 77 Mr. Park, counsel for the appellees at the very bottom of the page stated, I may say at this time that we recognize the possibility that at the end of litigation, we may have to restore these banks to their former status and we recognize that for our own protection we must do everything that we can to keep the assets segregated and identifiable so they can be restored, that we expect to do, that is what the appellees' counsel tells the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.947" offset="12923173">The District Court entered an order which had two sections to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.727" offset="12946265">I just like to call this to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.506" offset="12957445">The District Court's order, the so called order directing them to keep separate books and records is set forth at pages 71 to 73 and the order is basically in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.728" offset="13006242">On page 72 paragraph two states until further orders of the Court the defendants shall insofar as maybe reasonably possible under the National Banking Laws and in accordance with sound banking practices keep and maintain it's assets et cetera, et cetera in such manner that in the event of consolidation is ultimately to be dissolved, the consolidated banks will be able to divide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.826" offset="13110627">Then the order goes on in paragraph three with seven specific provisions, directing them what they ought to do and then in paragraph four it says the orders shall continue in full force in effect until further orders of the Court and the Court reserved the right to make any modification or supplemental orders that maybe necessary from time to time in the premises.</text>
