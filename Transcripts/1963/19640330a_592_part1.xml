            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="44.329" offset="280639">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.375" offset="288893">This case is here for the second time on the merits and because it's the petitioner's view that this is a case that has influenced to great deal by facts in its history with the Court's permission, I will attempt to summarize the history of the proceedings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.958" offset="391189">Some time in the Spring of 1951, a group of Negro high school students then attending the Robert R. Moton High School which was a Negro High School in Prince Edward County, Virginia, believing that they were not being accorded adequate or equal education opportunities, decided to go on strike from school and left the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.330" offset="496724">They got in touch with the lawyers and the lawyers persuaded them that the best way for them to present their claim was to present their grievances in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.840" offset="534758">And eventually, in May of 1951, a complaint was filed in the United State's District Court, attacking the constitutional validity of Virginia's separate school law.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.157" offset="583973">That cause eventually reached this Court and was disposed of in Brown versus the Board of Education on the merits in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.801" offset="618559">In 1955, this Court remanded the cause with instructions to the District Court to grant relief, that is the transformation on the separate and segregated school system to a school system without discrimination based upon race with all deliberate fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.018" offset="703404">In 1955 on remand, petitioner made an application to the District Court seeking implementation of that decree and therefore the beginning of the process of desegregation by September of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.875" offset="770905">The District Court then a statutory court, answered a general order and which it forbade any discrimination, but held that the time was not ripe and there was not time enough for the County School Board to make plans for the admission of students without segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.368" offset="848854">In 1956, petitioner appeared before the Court again and again requested that this Court's order be implemented beginning in September of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.650" offset="890023">The District Court, still a statutory court, took this matter, but held that since all of the constitutional issues had been resolved that the question for resolution was now for a single court for the resident Judge and dissolved the statutory court and the matter was referred to the resident Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.388" offset="964942">It came on for hearing before the single judge in 1957 with an application by petitioner for implementation as of September, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.876" offset="1002872">The District Judge ruled that the time was not ripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.863" offset="1014784">He construed this Court's decree and implementation decree as giving him discretion and then under the circumstances he said, “The time was not ripe for any decree to be entered because he did not know when Prince Edward County would be able to comply with this Courts decree.”</text>

            <text syncTime="256.572" offset="1129618">The Court of Appeals reversed, taking the view that the time had come for the County Board of Prince Edward County to be told to apply, to commence compliance with this Court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.251" offset="1196387">The matter then came on for hearing before the District Court again in 1958 and again, the petitioners requested the time of compliance be set as of September of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.360" offset="1252812">At that time, the County School Board introduced evidence showing that they needed more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.069" offset="1283636">It indicated that a survey was being made by the -- they appointed persons to make a survey and may based upon what the results of that survey would give them help in complying with decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.741" offset="1338284">The District Judge felt after hearing the evidence that 10 years from 1955, 10 years from the date of the implementation decree of this Court would be at the time when it would be ripe for the School Board to be ordered to commence the segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.815" offset="1406621">So he set the date as of September, 1965 for the County School Board to commence the desegregation of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.988" offset="1439326">The Court of Appeals reversed on May 5, 1959 and set the date for the commencement of the segregation of the high schools as of September, 1959 and ordered the County School Board to make plans for the elimination of segregation in the elementary schools at the earliest practicable date.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.763" offset="1530441">Now in 1956, in May of 1956, the County School -- the County Board of Supervisors enacted a resolution indicating that they would not levy any taxes or appropriate any funds for the maintenance and support of any public schools in the county in which Negroes and Whites were educated together.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.183" offset="1628139">That resolution is set out in the record and in our petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.496" offset="1777351">After the order of the Court of Appeals of May 5, 1959, the County School Board -- the Board of Supervisors I am sorry, and this is set out at Appendix C of our petition, passed a resolution refusing to levy any taxes and to appropriate any funds for the maintenance of public schools in Prince Edward County.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.292" offset="1904515">It made a public statement to this effect, and made it a part of its record, its reasons for doing so and its reasons where that it would not and would not support and maintain any schools in which Negro and white children were educated together in the light of the fourth coming Court decree they would be required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.600" offset="1985808">Now this brings us roughly to the present proceedings which are presently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.793" offset="2026559">In September of 1959, the Prince Edward School found -- County School Foundation which had been charted in 1955, began the operation of secondary and elementary schools for the white children in the County.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.147" offset="2103986">It enrolled, there were some roughly 1,500 white students who were going to the public school as of June of 1959 and it enrolled some little over 1,300 of these students.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.419" offset="2165008">During the first year that is September of the 1959, 1960 school term, no tuition was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.458" offset="2197191">But during the second year, the Board, the Foundation set forth tuition charges of $240 for the elementary grades and $265 for the secondary grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.060" offset="2263646">On July 18 of 1960, the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors enacted two ordinances, one, permitting a grant in aid of education, a tuition grant of $100 per child to attend a nonsectarian private school in the County and the only nonsectarian private school in the County was the Prince Edward School Foundation and it allowed as well a 25% tax credit, a rebate of taxes to persons who made any contributions for the support and maintenance of a nonsectarian private school in the County which of course, as I indicated was the school foundation.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.480" offset="3781256">State Superintendent of Public Instruction, yes sir and the County Treasurer and sought to -- and requested relief on the Federal Court on four grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.465" offset="3837262">One, to have the Court enjoined the defendant from refusing to maintain and operate public schools in Prince Edward County.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.833" offset="3870699">Two, from the expending public funds for the direct or in support of any private schools which practiced discrimination and from allowing tax credits to be used to support any school that practiced discrimination and restraining defendants from conveying, leasing, or transferring possession of any of the school property to a private organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.249" offset="3968397">The case was tried on these facts in the court below in July of 1961 and after hearing the Court reached the conclusion that the local tuition grant program was an invasion of this Court's decree and order and that therefore it came within the condemnation of Cooper versus Aaron, and that the tax credit also constitutes, the local tax credit program constituted such invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.996" offset="4119385">Therefore, those, both of those were enjoined on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.415" offset="4137044">The Court also held a, in a construction of the State's scholarship program that it was intended to be applied only when the public schools were open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.954" offset="4179153">So that for these reasons, it enjoined both the State scholarship program and any of the tuition grants locally for so long as the public schools remain closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.909" offset="4230980">It reached the conclusion however that insofar as the merits, the basic merits of the claim, that is whether the schools could remain closed, could be closed and whether this was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment involved questions of state law and that these questions could not be settled without an adjudication of state law matters and applying the doctrine of federal abstention, it withheld decree -- it withheld ruling on these questions until this issue had been settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.650" offset="4353964">We took, we meaning petitioners, went into the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia on mandamus, seeking to have that Court construe and determine the import of Section 136 of the Constitution of Virginia as to whether that provision compelled and required and mandated the Board of Supervisors to appropriate funds and levy taxes for the operation of public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.445" offset="4469112">That question was decided in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.853" offset="4478830">The Court held that this was the power where this provision was discretionary, that the Virginia Constitution mandated the general assembly to maintain schools but the question of whether appropriation should be made by the County Board of Supervisors under 136 was discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.229" offset="4556257">We then returned to the District Court seeking further relief in the light of that adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.827" offset="4590634">The District Court in July of 1962, reached the conclusion that it would no longer apply the doctrine of federal abstention, that the schools had been closed and often defined of the fundamental law, and that the public schools in Prince Edward County under the Fourteenth Amendment could not be closed as long as the State of Virginia maintained schools in the rest of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.059" offset="4723649">For this reason, it said that this was an adjudication of the federal claims where it would not issue an injunction in support of this because an injunction may not be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.334" offset="4768684">It reached the conclusion of what, that the -- since the defendants might voluntarily, the law having been declared complied with the Court's order, that it would withhold issuing a decree but it ordered the County Board to make plans for the admission of -- for the reopening of public schools and for the admission of students without regard to race by September of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.500" offset="4865337">And that if the schools were not opened, the Court set the matter down for a hearing on September the 7th in 1962 where would -- it would listen to all of the applications and orders made counsel of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.912" offset="4931062">On September the 7th, it was clear when the counsel appeared in Court that no plans had been made, that no plans would be made and that the schools would not be opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.594" offset="4977768">The Court then reaffirmed its ruling, but deferred entering of injunctive decree, pending review of this matter by the Court of Appeals and by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.477" offset="5033253">We appealed from the order on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.670" offset="5046000">One, on the ground that the District Court should have issued injunctive relief and secondly, we appealed on the grounds that the limitation of the injunction against the use of state scholarship funds, local tuition grants, and certain tax credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.077" offset="5119666">For as long as the public schools remain closed it was too narrow a reading of the rights of the petitioners under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.893" offset="5150908">We contended that there should have been a broader injunction against is to bar the use of state money for any school that discriminated and for the use of state money to evade and frustrate the rights of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.387" offset="5208900">The Court of Appeals filed a motion for a -- to accelerate our field with the hope that the matter would be adjudicated and finally settled for the opening of schools by September of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.121" offset="5275878">The hearing was held in the Court of Appeals -- Court of Appeals in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.864" offset="5294791">Argument was held before the Court of Appeals in January of 1963 and in August of ‘63, the Court handed down its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.290" offset="5324570">In its opinion and the divided vote, it held that the doctrine of federal abstention should have applied to the whole matter which was before the lower court, both in respect to the State scholarship program, local tuition grant program, and in respect to the basic rights of the petitioners as to whether the schools could remain closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.468" offset="5413282">And at that point, there was a case pending in the courts which the defendants had instituted and the Court held that – vacated the judgment of both judgments of the lower court awaiting their determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.543" offset="5473573">The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in December, after we had applied for a petition for writ of certiorari here, came down with its opinion in this matter, holding that the Virginia school program was in effect a local option program, that there was no state power, no power on the part of the defendant State Board, local county board or Superintendent Public of Instruction to open and operate or maintain and support the public schools in Prince Edward County as long as the County Board of Supervisors did not levy taxes and appropriate funds for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.133" offset="5671894">And that there was no power in the State to compel the local county board of supervisors to appropriate funds for that purpose, and that the general assembly had -- although it was under a mandate to provide schools and to maintain an efficient system of public education that had done this, when it had established a system pursuant to which if the local county and districts desire to that they could participate in and that the law did not require that they should operate the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.984" offset="5807313">This Court granted the – set the matter down thereafter on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.662" offset="5834062">Now I would want to make one point before I leave the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.069" offset="5867604">In September 14 of 1951, the State was made a party to these proceedings on motion, on its motion and when the cause was here and before it was a party to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.129" offset="5931865">We are aware of no order that has eliminated the State that it had been withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.196" offset="5956106">In each of the proceedings, each of the hearings in the District Court and before the Court of Appeals in the history of this case, the Attorney General of Virginia has represented -- had been represented and has argued up through the May 5, 1959 decision of the Court of Appeals for delay and for frustration and for delay in the implementation of the Court's orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.531" offset="6065507">This was at a point when only the Division Superintendent and the County Board of Education were parties to these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.777" offset="6098526">With the amended supplemental complaint, the Attorney General has been in the proceedings representing the State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.120" offset="6143875">I raise this question not for the technical question as to whether the State is before the Court as a party, but I think that it is important that the highest officer of the State was aware or order or appoint to what was going on, knew what was going on and indeed participated in the arguments before the Court and the theory of the County Board of Supervisors that they had a legal right to not to implement this -- to have this Court decree them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.732" offset="6278248">Now it's our position where the nature of this case, the kind of case of which it is the delays and the frustration and the protracted nature of this cause and the facts which we had set up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2308.000" offset="9335411">The State having assumed that obligation, I think it puts them in entirely different posture when it attempts to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.503" offset="9369370">I might be in a little more difficult position if the State were beginning to have the education in various of the counties and didn't have in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.120" offset="9407822">But in this instance, the case of state has withdrawn a vital necessity from that it has allocating to various persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.447" offset="9449200">And it seems to me that there is no -- you can't make a distinction in county based on geography or to apply an education is more important to the individual's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.428" offset="9505102">And I would think that this would be a denial of the equal protection of the law because I would think it would be a denial of the equal protection of the law as long as that State assumed the obligation of educating person in other place.</text>
