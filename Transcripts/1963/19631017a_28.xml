            <text syncTime="29.297" offset="220557">There is really only one issue here involved and that issue sirs is whether or not the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had jurisdiction to review the orders of the Special Enquiry Officer as authorized by the Attorney General of the United States to be made in certain cases and situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.758" offset="318360">Sometime in September, on September the 26th, 1961, Congress passed the legislation, thereby empowering we believe the Circuit Court to rule and review on these matters which have been made final administratively as far as a special enquiry officer is concerned, and then to the Board of Immigration of Appeals in Washington where they have the last say administratively as far as a person is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.582" offset="457749">In this sense, that matter was done and thereafter in a declaratory judgment the matter was taken to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.964" offset="503202">The Judge there hearing the matter said I am sorry, we have no, we no longer have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.421" offset="529011">Jurisdiction now lies with the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.103" offset="547819">So we pursued to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that we did not have the, that they did not have jurisdiction under Section 106 of Immigration Nationality Act or 8 U.S.C., Section 1105a, which is entitled, “Judicial review of orders of deportation and exclusion,” and the words to which they take exception to are “Judicial review of all final orders of deportation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="151.437" offset="709151">Those are the magic words which they say does not encompass.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.468" offset="737259">This case and therefore is without the orbit of their jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.409" offset="769024">It is our contention sirs, that there is jurisdiction, that there is an outstanding order of deportation even though the issuance of their warrant maybe stayed and that there are certain graces which maybe greater among which are suspension of deportation or a voluntary departure, if executed within the time allocated by the administrative officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.125" offset="1003917">We say that in the Seventh Circuit and in the Ninth Circuit, they have ruled on this matter already in the affirmative saying that they do have jurisdiction and in the Lower Court, the District Court for the Southern District of New York, Mr. Justice (Inaudible) in their two cases I believe in the Zupicich case and in the Jova case was in the Ninth District, have also ruled in the district that they do not have jurisdiction, that the jurisdiction properly belongs in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the second -- and to that effect the government does not disagree with us.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.451" offset="1705148">On the question of a possible mootness of this case, which you raised Mr. Justice Goldberg, it is the government's position that the merits, the merits of this case which have never been reached are moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.673" offset="1782053">However, as long as there is a debatable issue as to the correctness of that view and we concede that it is a debatable point, the threshold question of which of the two lower Courts, the Court of Appeals or the District Court should decide the merit is not eluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.266" offset="1892394">I think that the only conditions under which this jurisdictional question which is the only question before this Court would be moot would be, if the alien conceded that the merits were moot or that at least they were moot beyond any current venture.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.082" offset="3987728">The District Director said failure to exercise is probably -- where as this affect by state may result in the withdrawal of the privilege of voluntary departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.983" offset="4043316">However, on that same date on which that directive was issued the District Director also said, also stated to the alien and this appears at page 93 of the government's brief, in the event that you should fail to depart voluntarily within the time authorized then pursuant to the order of deportation in your case and Section 243 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, your deportation to Italy has been directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.089" offset="4179780">Now it seems to me the tying that order together with the District Director's Direction to hold into affective departure on or before that date together with special enquiry officer's original order which combined the two that the contingent order of deportation which was contained in the special enquiry officer's original order rested so to speak upon the aliens failure to affect his departure by December 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.734" offset="4326275">However, I wish to make it clear Mr. Justice that the government does not believe that this case hinges in any way upon criminal or not, the petitioner is still technically under a voluntary departure order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.372" offset="4392835">Even assuming for argument that he still maybe considered to be under the order of voluntary departure and not technically under a final order of deportation, the special inquiry officer's basic order of September 19th in which he granted voluntary departure but (Inaudible) right into it a contingent order that he, that a deportation order would immediately come into affect without any further proceedings if he fails to avail himself of voluntary departure is a final order of deportation within the meaning of Section 106.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.866" offset="4734830">Now prior to 1940, the distinction, which I have been putting some emphasis here upon namely this the distinction between an order of deportation and the adjudication of deportability would not been important because prior to that year the Attorney General had no discretion with respect to deporting a deportable person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.231" offset="4844335">The order of deportation followed automatically and invariably upon a determination that the alien was deportable under the law, but in 1940 the Attorney General was given this new and important power to suspend the deportation of an alien who was deportable either admittedly so or found to be so in case of extreme hardship and the second power of committing him to depart voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.731" offset="4974320">Now -- and from the beginning, from the beginning by regulations having the force of law, this dispensing power has been exercised in the deportation proceeding itself by the same officer who has the power -- to whom has been delegated by the Attorney General the authority to issue the deportation order with the result that where suspension has been granted there is no deportation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.905" offset="5123009">Therefore, it seems to the government that considering all these factors that a realistic and reasonable reading of the phrase, final order of deportation in the light of this (Inaudible) to which I have referred encompasses not only the basic deportability adjudication as the majority below thought, but encompasses the adverse disposition of any petition for discretionary relief which the alien may have asked for.</text>
