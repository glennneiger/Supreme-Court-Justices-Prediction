            <text syncTime="24.018" offset="200474">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.705" offset="215207">Before turning to the specific details of this, the New York legislative apportionment case, a word or two might be appropriate of concerning the relationship which this case bares to the body of cases decided by lower federal courts and by the state courts since this Court's decision in Baker against Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.904" offset="323981">It is fitting that the Court today begins its review of some of these cases with the New York apportionment case because the New York case reflects one extreme of judicial reaction to Baker v. Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.524" offset="402453">In this case, the Federal District Court in the Southern District of New York sustained the constitutionality of the apportionment of a state legislature in which challenge was directed to both houses of that legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.129" offset="472879">And in which both houses of the legislature were seriously malapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.855" offset="499837">Following Baker against Carr, with surprising speed and near unanimity, a consensus appears to have been reached by the lower Federal District Courts and by the state courts and that consensus is, that regardless of what rule may apply to the second house of a legislature, surely one house must be apportioned primarily on the basis of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.478" offset="642257">12 federal and 6 state cases are cited for the proposition that this consensus exists in the joint amicus curiae brief filed by the American Jewish Congress, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.325" offset="729715">Indeed, the New York case is apparently the only case in which challenge was directed to both houses of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.622" offset="778930">Both houses are malapportioned and all forms of relief were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.830" offset="807664">Some evidence of the extent to which the consensus that one house must be based on population exist is found in another amicus curiae brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.288" offset="861581">That's filed by the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey and the Attorneys General of some 14 other States, this brief in support of the appellees in the Maryland case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.878" offset="915916">There, the argument proceeds on the assumption that, of course, the apportionment of one house must be based on population.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.736" offset="963354">Appellants take the position that the Federal Constitution requires that both houses must be apportioned primarily on the basis of population, but although we take this position --</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.432" offset="13822077">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.226" offset="13837333">This case is one of four arising from New York, Alabama, Maryland and Virginia that require the Court to rule for the first time upon the constitutionality of the apportionment of seats in a state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.457" offset="13906192">The ultimate question to which all four of cases point is what is the meaning, in the field of legislative apportionment, of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws or to put in a little differently, by what standards, by what criteria giving meaning to the phrase "equal protection" is the constitutionality of a legislative apportionment to be judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.239" offset="14013398">Neither these cases nor any other single case or group of cases can supply the complete answers to the ultimate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.160" offset="14053000">We need to keep the ultimate question in mind, however, because whatever is decided here must fit a coherent analysis, as has been suggested in the argument, and must be susceptible of being reduced to generalizations that are good across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.288" offset="14125516">But at the same time, this can be made a manageable problem, I think, only by adhering to the traditional process of deciding the cases before the Court and leaving other questions that logically don't have to be decided to the future, provided they can genuinely be left open and nothing is said that necessarily determines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.780" offset="14211511">In an effort to steer that kind of little course, I shall not confine myself to the present New York case, but will try to give an answer that is comprehensive enough to cover these four cases and to make a start on the problem as one might put it of implementing Baker and Carr, but I shall go no farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.470" offset="14298237">There are clearly some questions that I leave to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.834" offset="14319762">We propose four general principles which I would like to state first summarily then I'm going to come back to each in an effort to clarify its meaning and indicate the reasoning that lies behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.727" offset="14375351">First, we say that the starting point and this hardly says anything, that the starting point in adjudicating the constitutionality of a legislative apportionment is the representation accorded qualified voters' per capita.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.876" offset="14431880">I'm simply asserting a measuring stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.945" offset="14440135">I'm not asserting anything about its constitutional validity or invalidity in that proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="4688.757" offset="18859426">The Maryland apportionment, it seems to us, to be a crazy quilt because there, the State has given less representation per capita to the people of three suburban counties than it gives to the people of Baltimore City, the urban center, or to the rural counties and we -- we say that there's, on the face of it, no justification for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.736" offset="18967364">Now, the state authorities come in and say, "Oh, yes, there is a justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="4733.585" offset="19038730">And we think that the financial center and the shipping industry and the steel industry and the people in connection with them are more important and so are the farmers more important than the people that live in the rural suburbs and therefore, we are going to give each of them greater representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4778.947" offset="19220229">Indeed, the crazy quilt test of necessity requires some other test to go with it, I think, either by implication or explicitly because if there is no limit to the things that a State can take into account in apportioning seats in the legislature, if it may prefer farmers over storekeepers, bankers over wage earners, port cities over manufacturing establishment, cities with a population, say, between 20,000 to 35,000, over bigger cities or littler towns and so forth and if the rationalization can be supplied after the event, then I suppose anyone with sufficient time and sufficient imagination could supply some rule that would explain the crazy quilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="5388.655" offset="21659021">That -- that's what I'm trying to address myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.725" offset="21671246">I want, first, if I may, to come to Your Honor's question about encouraging movement to the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.315" offset="21709699">I replied that a State could not give them more representatives in order to encourage people to move out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.399" offset="21733940">Also it's quite clear that tax advantages and regulatory laws might be directed in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.570" offset="21762675">Now, if I may, before I come to defy, may I simply suggest that there's nothing novel in the suggestion that discriminations that are permissible in one context maybe impermissible in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.671" offset="21811054">I suppose, for example, that if a State wished to encourage people to go into the steel industry that the various tax benefits and other things might do, but I don't think it would be a permissible way to encourage them to say that no one outside the steel industry may have trial by jury, that only those in the steel industry may have trial by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.702" offset="21915230">Nor do I think if the aim is to encourage the farming regions that a State should say or could constitutionally say, "We won't supply education to farmers' children because then they must stay on the land but we will supply an education to bankers' children," and there are other cases which suggest that there is room for differences of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.685" offset="22007181">In the matters of apportionment, I suggest that the critical difference is between rules which serve the purpose of making representative government work better, the operation of which may have collateral consequence of creating discriminations per capita and rules whose only function is to create classes of voters with preferred political rights, disproportionate to their number, which we say is impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.419" offset="22130061">Now, let me explain first what I mean by making the legislature more representative and then go to the question, where do I find the rule that prohibits creating the preferred classes of voters, just to give one more political right than the other?</text>

            <text syncTime="5522.602" offset="22194845">I think there's also another question to address yourself to is to whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has anything to do whatever with apportionment, as distinguished from the racial discrimination cases of exercising civil rights?</text>

            <text syncTime="5541.170" offset="22269032">Well, I will -- I will try to -- by making representative government work better, the kind of thing to which I suggest maybe a permissible purpose of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.607" offset="22318874">I have it in mind that a legislature is not simply a mirror to public opinion like a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.666" offset="22347086">It's a deliberative body and deliberation requires knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.641" offset="22366939">For that reason, it would seem to me that it might be thought desirable to take steps to ensure that the representatives in one house of the legislature came from geographical districts small enough, so that the -- there would be no part of the State which didn't have someone there who knew its people and their needs and the individual conditions in the individual locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.076" offset="22464742">An admirable example, I think certainly in the past, would've been Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Gulf in Massachusetts Coast where their problems where distinct and they're ought to be -- could be thought there'd be -- ought to be somebody in the legislature to know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.593" offset="22522734">I've told the Red Lake area in Minnesota way up in the northern part of the State is another, separate in area of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.558" offset="22558678">Again, geographically, small districts might be sought to enable people to know their representative better and him to know all the people in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.725" offset="22595250">It might be thought that a legislature was better informed and more representative if it -- it this Government recognized -- the apportionment recognized the political subdivisions that have a historic coherence and identity of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.195" offset="22661183">Indeed, anyone who's participated in town or county government knows that the town hall or the county courthouse is in a sense, say, nerve center for political organism and that it is more in tune with the all the county, all the people in the county than the sheer numbers might indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.636" offset="22758985">Again, I suppose a measure of continuity or stability or maybe thought a desirable purpose in the workings of the legislature or it might be thought desirable to minimize the number of political organizations that had to be created for representative districts so as to have effective organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.710" offset="22835263">This is what I mean by the permissible purposes.</text>
