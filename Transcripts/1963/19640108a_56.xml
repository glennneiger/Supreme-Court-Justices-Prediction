            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 56, Honorable Francis L. Van Dusen, United States District Judge, et al., Petitioners, versus Roberta Barrack, Administratrix, et al.</text>

            <label>Mr. Owen B. Rhoads</label>
            <text syncTime="25.222" offset="204257">Mr. Chief Justice, with submission to Your Honors, Morton Hollander of the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and I will share the argument on petitioner's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.632" offset="257860">The issue which we present to Your Honors, is whether the District Court Judge, the Honorable Francis Van Dusen of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, had power or authority under the wording of Section 1404 (a) of Judicial Code to transfer to the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.415" offset="349080">These 45 actions, 40 wrongful death actions, five personal injury actions, whether he had authority, you transfer them to Massachusetts, the district where the action had occurred, where at the time of argument, 114 other actions arising out of the same accident where had been instituted and where he found that it would be for the convenience of witness -- witnesses and in the interest of justice and Massachusetts being the only jurisdiction where all defendants, where venue and jurisdiction was proper as to all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.771" offset="538415">In reaching that conclusion, he considered an argument which been made by some of the plaintiffs that he lacked power because the plaintiffs, the fiduciary representative plaintiffs, had not been -- had not taken out ancillary appointments in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.572" offset="645622">The Court of Appeals held that the limiting words in 1404 (a) where it might have been brought, where the action might have been brought, prevented the transfer of these actions because of the failure of these plaintiffs to obtain ancillary appointments prior to instituting the suits in Pennsylvania, that is obtaining ancillary appointments in Massachusetts prior to obtaining -- to instituting the suits in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.137" offset="775920">And the Court of Appeals felt that it was constrained to do this on the reading of Your Honors' opinion in Hoffman against Blaski.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.961" offset="815208">Now, if Your Honor pleases, the facts, brief are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.656" offset="830046">On October the 4th, 1968, commercial airliner, very shortly after takeoff crashed in the Boston Harbor, is taken off from Logan International Airport in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.395" offset="880933">It had onboard 67 passengers and a crew of five, 10 -- there were 10 survivors.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.317" offset="920639">114 actions were started in the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.258" offset="944358">They were started against Eastern, the operator of the airline -- the airplane, against Lockheed, the manufacturer of the plane against General Motors Corporation, the manufacturer of the engines, against the United States and in some cases, against the Massachusetts Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.162" offset="1032025">Jurisdiction in Massachusetts was of course, under -- under Section 1391 (a) of the Judicial Code as to the corporate defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.813" offset="1078627">Under Section 1402 (b), the Federal Tort Claims Act as the United States and as to the Massachusetts Port Authority, again under Section 1391 (a) that being the only jurisdiction in which the Massachusetts Port Authority could be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.406" offset="1156995">The 55 actions which were instituted in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania were instituted, seven of them in admiralty, 21 against the corporate defendants, that is Eastern Airlines, General Motors Corporation and Lockheed.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.084" offset="1247692">There were 20 suits against the United States, four suits against all defendants, that is those four defendants and three suits against Eastern Airlines alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.087" offset="1315715">10 of those suits were disposed of, seven in admiralty, Judge Van Dusen dismissed and subsequently, the Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.662" offset="1358033">A petition for certiorari which is presented to this Court was denied in connection with those cases so they are now reinstated and we had filed -- defendants had filed on a motion to transfer as to those so actually, the ruling here will also govern those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.746" offset="1450402">Now if Your Honors please, a consideration of the history of delimiting words in Section -- of Section 1404 (a), we believe shows quite clearly that it does not permit state law to prevent the transfer of cases, that it is limited, it is a venue and jurisdiction section.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.869" offset="1578820">It was enacted at the time the judicial -- of the revision of the Judicial Code in its entirety in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.024" offset="1623437">It appears in Chapter 87, the Venue and Jurisdiction Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.040" offset="1659486">And it was based on the old common law, Judge made doctrine of -- for unknown convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.556" offset="1705566">And as Your Honors well know, if there was an alternate jurisdiction available then the courts could dismiss assuming that an action could be brought in the alternate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.392" offset="1784978">Now, 1404 (a) was shown, I think by the revisers notes and also by the earlier decisions of this Court to have been enacted to give a broader power of transfer that existed under that preexisting right to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.422" offset="1877034">The purpose was to restrict plaintiffs in their choice of forum and also to give a guide to the District Courts and to restrict them in their transfers so that the transfers would be restricted to districts where the actions might have been brought under federal statutes governing venue and jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.326" offset="2016632">The -- those Sections run from Section 30 -- 1391 through Section 1406 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.016" offset="2063444">And if you take the words which are used in those various sections, for example, 1391 (a) and (c) under which jurisdiction here attaches to the corporate defendants, the words are, "maybe brought," if you take Section 1402 (b) under which jurisdiction attaches to United States, the Federal Tort Claims Act, the words are, "maybe prosecuted."</text>
            <text syncTime="524.327" offset="2200639">The words of 1404 (a) under which defendants here moved for transfer are "might have been brought."</text>
            <text syncTime="534.457" offset="2241181">Now, the similarity of those words and the history we believe show that this is a venue and jurisdiction test.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.459" offset="2305233">It's a statute, it's a -- it's a Section which was to broaden a power to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.897" offset="2338983">Now, what is the effect of the action of the Court of Appeals here in holding that delimiting words where it might have been brought go beyond venue and jurisdiction and also force consideration of state restriction?</text>
            <text syncTime="584.897" offset="2442951">In this case, limitations on the right of the fiduciary to bring suit, Massachusetts saying that suit must -- that there must be ancillary letters before suit can be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.509" offset="2505435">But the state law or -- might just as well be a requirement of a filing of a bond to cover cost or the appointment of an agent for service so that it would leave in the hands, this decision, it is permitted us to stand, leaves in the hands of plaintiffs a complete choice of the forum in which they proceed or they could institute suit as they did here without applying for ancillary letters in Massachusetts or if it were a -- if a state statute were one of filing a bond, they could -- to cover cost, they could institute suit as they did here in the Eastern District and file a bond 10 days later in another district but under the Court of Appeals ruling here, delimiting words would prevent a transfer even though there's nothing in the situation which would in any way affect the substantive issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.223" offset="2800306">The results of the case or in these cases, even the distribution of funds recovered if there is a recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.972" offset="2859238">The plaintiffs --</text>

            <text syncTime="723.205" offset="2996224">In fact, there is one case if I understand Your Honor's question, entirely in the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.292" offset="3012524">The Felchlin case in Texas where the motion for transfer was made in California and transfer was denied because under Texas Law, there is no right of action in a foreign fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.687" offset="3086085">We say to that that we think it was improperly decided and that it is a question -- that case was decided before Your Honors' decision in the three cases in which you have decide -- discussed these limiting words before Hoffman, Blaski, Sullivan and Behimer, and the Continental Grain Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.653" offset="3173961">And actually, this consideration is not one of power or authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.264" offset="3200397">It's a consideration by the District Court of -- in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.470" offset="3225266">The transfer should deny -- need be denied and the interest of justice in that sort of a case under 1404 (a) because it's going back to the old for unknown convenience doctrine where there wouldn't have been a dismissal if there -- if there was no alternate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.806" offset="3294647">And we say that actually, that is the knob of the -- this isn't a case of lack of power or of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.760" offset="3334457">These things are the capacity to sue, is not a power or jurisdiction question, it is an interest in the interest of justice question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.265" offset="7400469">The Goranson case and the Tompkins case which are cited in our reply brief, two cases, one which are -- the Goranson which originated in the -- in Ohio District Court and was transferred to Virginia where the accident had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.078" offset="7495659">I'm sorry, that's -- and the Tompkins case where three cases were started against Capital Airlines in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.695" offset="7550203">Now, the New York Judge held that only one of those cases could be transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.776" offset="7574444">He said that he disagreed with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in this case but there is no point in transferring it because he had seen what had happened in the Goranson case where the Virginia Court had remanded to Ohio after transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.742" offset="7638392">So that as the result of Barrack in those Capital Airline cases, you now have a suit being tried in Ohio, arising out of a death, the suit being tried in Virginia for the same death and two suits being tried in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.710" offset="7722193">Now, even going further, this also affects 1406 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.121" offset="7743822">In this case, the Court of Appeals said that in three cases in which there were -- was improper venue, the body case, the breath and rights cases, the transfer had been proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.613" offset="7817801">Now certainly, the words of 1406 (a) could have been brought, don't differ really from might have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.993" offset="7859388">After our -- the petition had been filed in this Court, that was called to the Court of Appeals' attention and a modification of that opinion with respect to those three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.699" offset="7930128">The opinion was amended so that the body, their being an administrator in Massachusetts was transferred and the Court said that it did not pass on the breath or rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.495" offset="7985403">But what is the effect under 1406 (a), the improper venue section where it says that cases shall be dismissed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.411" offset="8028975">It means that the Court, our Court must transfer -- does it mean that it must transfer breath and rights one to the Middle District of Pennsylvania and one to New Jersey so that we now have cases being tried in the District of Massachusetts, cases being tried in the District Court in New Jersey, cases being tried in the Western District of Pennsylvania or a case and matters too, and cases in the United States District Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.758" offset="8150392">This is the discrimination, which results to frustration, which results from this decision and the fragmentizing and complete defeat of the intention and purposes of the Legislature in passing that Act.</text>
