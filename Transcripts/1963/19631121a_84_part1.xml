            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 84, William L. Greene, Petitioner versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.682" offset="246053">Mr. Gressman.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="37.017" stopTime="279.145">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="37.017" offset="251486">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.937" offset="267160">This is a suit for monetary restitution and just compensation, which comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.317" offset="316688">The case is essentially an aftermath and indeed is the result of the decision of this Court in 1959 in the case known as Greene versus McElroy, involving the same petitioner as is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.801" offset="414595">The opinion of the majority of this Court in Greene versus McElroy sets forth in great detail, the facts and the background which have led to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.765" offset="482408">Your Honors are therefore quite familiar and most of you having participated in that decision with the basic facts in this case, thereby making it unnecessary to relate at this time in detail the facts which have led to the present controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.469" offset="553253">I think it will be necessary only to highlight the more significant facts as they're now pertinent to the present litigation and to relate to you briefly, the events that have occurred subsequent to Your Honors' decision in Greene versus McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.122" offset="635904">Now, you will recall that the petitioner, William L. Greene, was an eminent aeronautical engineer, who was employed between the years of 1937 to 1953 at a defense plant known, shorthandedly, as ERCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.802" offset="750529">And in that employment, he produced notable achievements in the field in which the Government was interested in and actually rose to become vice president and general manager of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.383" offset="824926">The security problem which has given rise to this prolonged litigation really had its beginning in 1951, 12 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.460" offset="877171">Previous to that, he had had three security clearances from the Government, up to Top Secret clearances.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.168" offset="912071">Now, as stated in more detail in the opinion of this Court in the prior decision, in 1951, it was determined by one of the then security boards that were serious questions concerning Mr. Greene's security status.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.938" offset="1003081">As a result of which, he asked for a hearing and a resolution of these charges before a board called the Industrial Employment Review Board, the IERB.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.949" offset="1071208">As a result of that hearing, despite the lack of confrontation or cross-examination of witnesses, the original determination or charges were wiped-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.777" offset="1114467">Mr. Greene was found to be a good security risk and that his continued employment was found to be consistent with the National Security, and both he and ERCO were informed that he was authorized to work on secret contract work in connection with Government classified information at the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.762" offset="1218435">Now, this --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="279.145" offset="1220002">What year was that, Mr. Gressman?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="280.689" stopTime="282.949">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="280.689" offset="1226167">January of 1952.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="282.949" stopTime="283.870">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="282.949" offset="1235153">1952.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="283.870" stopTime="1064.947">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="283.870" offset="1238810">And this becomes important in this present litigation, because as I shall show briefly, in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.447" offset="1273187">This, at the present time, is the last piece of paper in petitioner's security file.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.856" offset="1302758">This clearance -- this determination in 1952 by the IERB, by judicial action is now at the last piece of paper, which appears in petitioner's file.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.587" offset="1365765">Now, another year elapses in 1953, whereas Your Honors will recall, the -- without any notice, warning or hearing, the Secretary of the Navy, based upon his own examination of the case file, summarily reversed this determination of the IERB and notified ERCO to exclude Mr. Greene from its plant facilities because his employment, he said, was not consistent with the National Security -- continued access to classified information was inconsistent to the National Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.078" offset="1547682">ERCO had no alternative but to discharge the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.046" offset="1567535">And he was discharged shortly thereafter, precisely April 23, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.506" offset="1601390">Now, that date is now important because that is the date upon which the monetary damages began to accrue, which is the subject matter of the present litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.504" offset="1657396">But from April 23, 1953, his loss of income began.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.179" offset="1688116">Now, you will also recall that the petitioner made strenuous efforts to overcome the determination of the Secretary of Navy and he was given at least two hearings before the various security boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.257" offset="1772440">In 1954, he had a so-called hearing before one of the review boards which resulted in a reaffirmation of the Secretary's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.703" offset="1818206">He followed that with another hearing both then -- with the same result in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.456" offset="1853210">So that there were -- in that -- in fact, three adverse determinations made as to petitioner's security status.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.415" offset="1909008">Now, the -- in the -- before the end of this round of security hearings between 1953 and 1956, the petitioner had filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia an equitable action seeking both equitable and declaratory relief against these proceedings, challenging the constitutionality of the hearings and the procedures on the basis that they violated his constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.794" offset="2062503">And that suit was expressly grounded upon the fact, among others, that petitioner was then suffering substantial and irreparable economic interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.732" offset="2122271">He set forth -- now I think, the precise dollar amount which he was then suffering computed from that date of April 23, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.929" offset="2167097">Now, this action, as you know, came up through the court system and to this Court and resulted in the decision in 1959, which very narrowly but very significantly held, that, "in the absence of explicit authorization from either the President or Congress, the respondents," that is the Government officials, "were not empowered to deprive petitioner of his job."</text>
            <text syncTime="552.317" offset="2312652">And I repeat, "Were not empowered to deprive petitioner of his job in a proceeding in which he was not afforded the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination."</text>
            <text syncTime="568.592" offset="2377749">Now, this decision and its implications, I believe, are evident and I believe they are controlling of the present for litigation because that holding, while it did not pretend or did not extend to a determination of the petitioner's right to access to classified information or did it -- or the merits of his security status, nevertheless, it did recognize certain fundamental elements which are significant in his present back pay suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.618" offset="2549844">It reflected in -- in its holding that petitioner's right to a job and his right to pursue his chosen profession, free from unwarranted government interference, was a right or was a property or liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment so that it is and under -- it is -- the decision reflects a recognition that the Government, by depriving this petitioner of his job, had in effect infringed upon constitutionally protected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.115" offset="2711803">More than that, there was expressed recognition given in the majority and the dissenting opinions of this Court that this petitioner was in fact suffering substantial economic monetary loss as a result of this governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.746" offset="2786408">I call Your Honors' attention to Footnote 21, in the majority opinion of this Court, where the Court quoted the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia which said, "That we have no doubt that Greene has in fact been injured."</text>
            <text syncTime="691.025" offset="2867493">He was forced out of a job that paid him $18,000 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.896" offset="2886928">He has since been reduced, so far as this record shows, to working as an architectural draftsman at a salary of some $4400 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.866" offset="2934888">Even more expressly was the statement of Mr. Justice Clark, in his dissenting opinion on page 513, where, in referring to the action of the Court, he said that Greene will now claim as -- as literally, reimbursement for his loss of wages, and a reference is there made to the companion case decided that day of Taylor versus McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.420" offset="3061008">This claim, Mr. Justice Clark said, will date back to 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.753" offset="3082428">His salary at that time was $18,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.019" offset="3103431">Now, the facts that he states are entirely accurate and his prediction has come true.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.152" offset="3124015">This is exactly the nature and the -- the basis of the present monetary claim filed by this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.413" offset="3164975">So that there was a general recognition and an understanding by this Court that, as a result of this unauthorized action of the Government, this petitioner was suffering substantial and serious economic injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.502" offset="3229341">Now, the reference which Mr. Justice Clark had made to the Taylor case is also interesting because here, you will recall that, in that companion case of Taylor, the -- or the -- shortly before the case came on for argument, the Secretary of Defense had granted Mr. Taylor a security clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.257" offset="3336443">And the Government then moved and this Court eventually held that the case was thereby mooted.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.093" offset="3363715">And Mr. Taylor, up until that point, had been in the same situation with Mr. Greene.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.970" offset="3387225">Upon the representation of the Solicitor General that Mr. Taylor, as a result of this action of the Secretary, would be eligible under the then applicable regulations for rest -- compensation or reinstitution for his lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.333" offset="3472697">This Court dismissed the case as mooted.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.066" offset="3487640">Now, the only applicable regulation, then in effect, which -- under which Mr. Taylor could have been and was in fact paid, is monetary compensation, was Paragraph 26 of the 1955 Department of Defense regulations or direct duty, then in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.589" offset="3581680">That is precisely the same regulation, the same paragraph under which this petitioner, Mr. Greene, has filed his claim for monetary damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.252" offset="3628387">And the Government concedes, there is no dispute, but that our claim was in fact filed under Paragraph 26 and must ultimately and exclusively be judged by the provisions of that paragraph of the 1955 regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.252" offset="3696410">The sum total, in other words, of the opinion and the judgment of this Court in Greene versus McElroy, I submit, contains all the essential ingredients necessary to examine, to understand and to pass upon the right of this petitioner to his monetary relief under Paragraph 26 of the 1955 directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.292" offset="3812498">Now, following the decision of this Court in the Greene case, the matter was remanded to the District Court for the injury of an appropriate order and that order becomes very significant at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.980" offset="3879267">It was drafted by the Government attorney, consented to by both parties, signed by the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.932" offset="3919078">And the order says that in light of this Court's opinion in Greene versus McElroy, it is ordered that the action of the Secretary of Defense and his subordinates, in finally revoking plaintiff's security clearance, was and is hereby declared to be not validly authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.276" offset="4000475">And now comes a significant sense, further ordered that any and all rulings, orders or determinations, wherein or whereby plaintiff's security clearance was revoked are hereby annulled and expunged from all records of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.349" offset="4088769">Now, let us see what this does to -- to the prior determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.846" offset="4110712">This means, in effect, that there has been judicial expungement from the -- all the records of the Government, the order of the Secretary of the Navy in 1953 and the two subsequent reaffirmations of that determination by the various review or appeals of the boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.473" offset="4225233">Leaving in effect, as I said previously, the 1952 favorable administrative determination of the IERB, which is the last and the only determination which can now be said to be in existence and which I submit is the only determination that has any relevance or meaning as to the years in question covering -- covered by this monetary claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.363" offset="5192808">What we are concerned with in this case is looking backwards to a period, when judicial action has resulted in revoking, annulling and expunging certain determinations, reinstating in effect for past period only, not for the present but for a past period of time for which we claim damages and claim that these damages are irreparable have accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.451" offset="5305135">We now look back to see what the impact is of these judicial determinations and actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.741" offset="5330317">Now, what a -- we -- we cannot now rewrite the history between 1953 and 1959 or 1960, which is the only period of which we're now concerned with, but there's no question about what they could at 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.944" offset="5403146">If you are eligible and -- and or needed as security access eligibility, the Government could make a -- a full scale hearing and determination of this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.163" offset="5444002">But my point is that there -- on the historic record, as amended by judicial action between 1953 and 1960 at least, there is no outstanding suspension or charge by which anything can now be resolved for that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.551" offset="5529579">The -- there was a letter, I think I pointed this out in one of the footnotes in my reply brief, there was a letter which was contained in the -- which reiterated the same little charges which had been the subject to the original proceeding which lead to this hearing and determination by the -- one of these Appeal Boards following the Secretary of Navy's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.619" offset="5633860">Now, that was precisely the type of hearing, the type of determination which this Court ruled, could not, was not authorized and the -- it seems to me the -- the entire action including the or the letter setting up the hearing, setting forth the charges, had been wiped off the records of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.377" offset="5900831">And we were asked and did supply to them the appropriate financial data under oath and this was filed in December of 1959, seven months prior to the promulgation of the 1960 regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.547" offset="5993514">This matter was kept under consideration by the Department of Defense for a period of a year and a half intersperse with various respondents between counsel and the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.926" offset="6051088">And finally, in June of 1961, the Department of Defense finally rejected petitioner's claim under Paragraph 26 of the 1955 regulation, stating that, "It has been determined by the Department of Defense that Mr. Greene does not qualify for a monetary restitution under the provisions of Paragraph 26."</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.746" offset="6166340">Now, I submit that that is the true, the only exhaustion of administrative remedy principle that is applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.687" offset="6202075">We pursued, we exhausted, we obtained a final administrative denial of our claim under Paragraph 26, after a year and a half of consideration by the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.475" offset="6257246">Now, that denial of the claim was coupled immediately with an offer to, if we would request it, an offer to hold a new security clearance hearing under the provisions of the 1960 regulation which, as I said, was adopted subsequent, seven months after we had originally filed the Paragraph 26 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.471" offset="6377305">We took the position then, we took -- take the position now that we were not compelled to follow such an administrative possibility, a new hearing, reopening it up again, the same charges, the same matters that had been going in to over the past 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.263" offset="6452433">We said that we have complied with Paragraph 26 at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.182" offset="6472077">And the 1960 regulation has no pertinence, no bearing upon a claim which has matured under Paragraph 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.204" offset="6516172">And as a result of the Defense Department's denial, we are forced to file this suit in the Court of Claims, alleging that we had complied with the regulation and adding to it a claim under the Just Compensation Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.986" offset="6827342">If we have not complied with Paragraph 26, it seems to me we're -- we simply have not stated the cause of action in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.007" offset="6855450">We can come in there and sue under an administrative or executive regulation, only if we can show that we have complied with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.818" offset="6894634">And we have complied with it, I submit so clearly that there is nothing more to exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.537" offset="6929533">This seems to me a circular reasoning which seeks to impose upon us an entirely different kind of a hearing under another regulation which has no relation, particularly if we are right in our contention that we have fully complied with Paragraph 26.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.479" offset="7069236">But it seems to me that you can understand whether or not we should go back to the night for another hearing only after you interpret Paragraph 26.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.750" offset="7206327">Now, as I say, it is conceded here and properly so that the only basis of our claim which -- or the proper basis of our administrative claim here is Paragraph 26 and that we are judged and must be -- the issue must be resolved under Paragraph 26.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.189" offset="8068159">Now, I suggest further that Paragraph 26, as it was explained to Congress by the Department of Defense officials, was said to be designed to achieve equity and justice for those employees who were relieved of their jobs at the suggestion of Government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.211" offset="8148198">Well, I suggest that the reading that I have suggested at Paragraph 26 is compelled by any standards of equity and justice which were said to be the underlying concepts of Paragraph 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.695" offset="8210160">To refuse to acknowledge the loss and sufferings, to refuse to acknowledge that there was not -- that there was a final determination by this Supreme Court and by the District Court favorable to this contractor employee, I think would be the height of inequity and injustice which Paragraph 26 was designed to avoid, because as I repeat, the decision of this Court demonstrates that the Government here was infringing upon constitutionally protected property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.783" offset="8358536">And there was irreparable injury caused to this petitioner which can never be wiped out, can never be -- can never be made whole unless Paragraph 26 is read in the matter in which I suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.230" offset="9072306">Except to say that basically, it ignores the settled rule that an executive agency is rigorously bound by the regulation which it has promulgated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2269.454" offset="9181184">But instead, the Government here, in its brief and throughout this case, has completely intermixed the 1955 regulation and the 1960 regulation taking from the 1960 regulation, what it does not find in the 1955 and amending or changing the 1960 regulation right before our eyes here, exciting out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.510" offset="9573439">But the -- in -- in addition of course, the 1960 regulation has established new procedures which in and of themselves may have constitutional questions attached to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.614" offset="9613876">They tried, they say, to -- to comply with certain of the comments and -- and reservations of this Court regarding confrontation and cross-examination but there still would be a possibility of questions being raised as to whether there has been complete, adequate compliance even there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.338" offset="9680750">But in any event, as I read the Government's position now, they apparently say that Paragraph 26 incorporates at the very least, the expressed requirement of the 1960 regulation that there'd be a final administrative determination on the merits subsequent to the original suspension or revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.712" offset="9794226">Now, I submit that the language of Paragraph 26 simply does not say that and that it is completely impermissible to read it into it by implication and certainly impermissible by reading into it from Paragraph 5 (c) of the 1960 directive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.676" offset="9878026">19 -- in 1955 they say, in cases where a final determination is favorable to -- to a contractor employee, but in 1965, years later, they become very precise and expand upon this and say, "If an applicant suffers a loss of earnings, resulting directly from a suspension or revocation, and at a later date, a final administrative determination was made in his favor, then you may get monetary restitution."</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.640" offset="10005922">Now, I submit there's a significant and a meaningful difference between those two standards that it is a recognition here by the drafters that they omitted the term "administrative" in the 1955 regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.399" offset="10060988">They pull a gap (Inaudible) hole and they require also that it -- that there'd be a determination at a later date after the revocation -- the revocation has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.954" offset="10107173">Now, I submit that there must be a presumption here that they meant to make a change and did make a change in the nature of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.682" offset="10146147">But we come back to the admitted fact, the concession that our claim was filed under the 1955 regulation and that we are bound by that interpretation -- that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.560" offset="10201631">And our claim is to be resolved in light of the -- the rule as it was originally written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.737" offset="10226291">And we get back again back of that to the rule that I stated a little earlier that an administrative agency, an executive agency must be rigorously bound by the language that it has itself promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.058" offset="10279581">Now, on that basis, it seems to me completely impermissible and unwarrantable to read in to the 1955 regulation what did not appear until the 1960 regulation was adapted, after this claim was -- was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.876" offset="10354918">And as an addendum even to that, I submit, that we do have, by judicial action, a reinstatement of a prior administrative determination on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.001" offset="10415417">If you want to say that -- that that regulation -- that determination of the IERB is the only thing that covers petitioner's security status for the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.479" offset="10473305">Now, I submit that there is nothing in the purpose of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.959" offset="10499218">There's certainly no overwriting public interest or governmental interest which would justify this truncated resolution or determination or reading of the Paragraph 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.115" offset="10563793">As I've said, the Government is fully protected that this petitioner ever wants to work in an -- a defense contract and need to security clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.289" offset="10604544">But all they're offering him now is an access eligibility determination which he does not need, he does not want, he is not working now in a defense industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.769" offset="10650415">And under the Government's own regulation, the defense manual, he would not be entitled to seek such an access clearance until and -- and unless he is employed by a defense contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.481" offset="10709347">This is, in a sense, nothing but an advisory opinion that they are asking us to go through to achieve monetary restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.640" offset="10749889">And if they were to find that he presently is not eligible to access eligi -- access to classified information, then they would presumably deny his monetary claim despite the fact that that is a finding only in terms of his present eligibility, ignoring completely the fact that we're dealing with a period long since passed between 1953 and 1960.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.312" offset="11800639">Now, it's rather interesting, Your Honor, that in the last paragraph of the 1960 regulation which provides for monetary restitution on this different basis, it says that any recovery under that regulation shall be completely -- on the entire means of recovery against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.199" offset="11900217">It says here, "Payments under this provision shall be in full satisfaction of any or all claims of whatever nature they maybe which the applicant has or may assert against the United States as well as against the Department of Defense and other agencies."</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.785" offset="11962493">Well, I think if that is true, if that is proper to make that limitation, I don't -- I'm not sure at the moment whether that is also on the 1955 regulation but assuming that it is, I still think that if you have another basis on the Constitution that is -- is forbidden to you by a virtue of such a provision, I think that at very least it indicates a strong reason why these paragraphs should be interpreted to give you the restitution to which you might otherwise be entitled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.438" offset="12113168">Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.326" offset="12136678">We believe that the central position -- central question in this case is, whether it was within the Court of Claims' discretion to order the suspension of this proceeding in order for petitioner to pursue his administrative remedy before the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.783" offset="12202506">Now, our -- our basic position as it's quite clear in our brief is that not only was it proper for the Court to do so but that this is a classic case in which it should undertake that procedure where there is an adequate administrative remedy available to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.004" offset="12263424">It is capable of providing complete relief to him and the constitutional questions can thereby be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.886" offset="12290905">Now, in -- with respect to Mr. Justice Harlan's question on whether or not this is a jurisdictional problem or one of exhaustion, it seems to me that what we can, in essence, regard the Court of Claims as having done is that they determine the question that petitioner now, which is to litigate favorably to the Government, that is, that it read the regulation as we read the regulation and that it -- then send it to the Pentagon for action accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.276" offset="12452446">And of course, if -- if that is wrong that that question can always be litigated although it may not have to be litigated if complete restitution is given by the Pentagon which -- which is still a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.170" offset="12508035">Now, I think it's important for us first to take a very careful look at the administrative remedy that we believe is applicable and that is, as petitioner points out Paragraph 26 of the 1955 regulation, the essence of that paragraph is contained in its first sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.812" offset="12602598">In cases where a final determination is favorable to a contractor employee, the Department whose activity originally forwarded the case to the Director, and that's the Director of the Office of Personnel Security, will reimburse the contractor employee in an equitable amount for any loss of earnings during the interim resulting directly from a suspension of clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.546" offset="12697579">Now, of course, the 1955 regulation has been superseded by the 1960 regulation, which was promulgated as the result of this Court's 1959 decision in Greene against McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.166" offset="12744077">However, because petitioner did apply for restitution before the 1960 regulation went into effect and because the 1955 procedure regulation does provide an easier standard for peti -- for petitioner to meet, the Department of Defense has agreed to process petitioner's claim under Paragraph 26 of the 1955 regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.867" offset="13642794">But we -- we do not believe that that was a holding that he was entitled to a clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.554" offset="13657631">In fact, Mr. Justice Harlan at least specifically pointed out that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.577" offset="13685635">If I may -- I may go on for just a moment as to what remedy we have in mind, I -- this is decidedly preliminary but I do want to point out that the procedure that the Department would employ in arriving at this final favorable determination or final unfavorable determination as the case maybe, in the procedure that we believe that Mr. Greene must go through, would apply the more liberal procedures of the 1960 regulation which was issued under the authority of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.649" offset="13845922">Now, provision is made in that regulation, the 1960 regulation, for a proceeding in which the individual has rights of confrontation and cross-examination and in which the use of information that cannot be disclosed to him for national security reasons is very sharply and very closely restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.898" offset="13922931">Thus, petitioner is being offered the best of both regulations, the easier standard for restitution of the 1955 regulation and the more liberal procedures of the 1960 regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.856" offset="13978833">However, petitioner refuses to proceed in the Department of Defense under either regulation or any combination of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.964" offset="14007254">And the central contention is that he has already satisfied the requirements of Paragraph 26 and that it is therefore unnecessary to remit his case to the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.442" offset="14053125">He argues first that this Court's decision in Greene against McElroy, coupled with the order of Judge Keech on remand constituted a final favorable determination for purposes of Paragraph 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.870" offset="14110804">Now, the fundamental defect in this argument, as we see it, is that the final favorable determination contemplated by Paragraph 26 is a determination that the individual is eligible to access to classified defense information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.054" offset="14175587">Now, a fair-minded examination of the context of the regulation, we believe conclusively, conclusively demonstrates that that it so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3594.153" offset="14479966">It's not altogether clear that 1959 would be the cutoff date because we are -- we, in the Department of Justice, are talking about a determination yet to be made and Paragraph 26 indicates that that determination is the end of the right to restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.107" offset="14559796">Now, of course, it maybe that other circumstances would come into play such as the fact that he -- maybe he's now earning more than he was back in 1953 or maybe it could be said that he unreasonably delayed in -- in seeking relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.630" offset="14617893">But other -- those factors apart, it's not obvious to me at any rate that that -- that the cutoff date has yet arrived such that it wouldn't necessarily be a determination in 1964, let us say, of his situation back in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.347" offset="14700753">It would -- it would be currently relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3661.710" offset="14750177">As I say, we believe that the context of the regulation at the very least requires the reading that we have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.291" offset="14784554">The opening sentence of the entire regulation of which section -- of which Paragraph 26 is a part, makes it clear what kind of determination the regulation is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.521" offset="14841501">That sentence is this, "This part describes the uniform standard in criteria for determining the eligibility of contractors, contractor employees and certain other individuals, as set forth in this part, to have access to classify defense information."</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.085" offset="14907747">And thereon -- from thereon, it sets forth detailed procedures by which determinations are to be reached and that each level, the screening board level, hearing board level and finally the review board level, the regulation clearly sets forth the kind of determination of access eligibility that is to be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.076" offset="14999698">Significantly, the regulation makes the review board's determination final subject only to reconsideration by the review board itself, by the Secretary of Defense or by the three service secretaries jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.199" offset="15056123">Thus, it was not contemplated that there would be any judicial review of this finding of access eligibility such that the only final favorable determination that the drafters of the regulation could possibly have had in mind was an administrative determination of access eligibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3981.992" offset="16031326">Now, we believe that further on very strong confirmation that restitution under the -- under Paragraph 26 is to be based on a clearance determination that comes from this Court's decision in Greene against McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.255" offset="16096423">There, this Court, as counsel has pointed out in its brief, discussed Paragraph 26 and it described Paragraph 26 in the following terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="4071.887" offset="16390875">Finally, it has been the consistent position of the Department of Defense in implementing the 1955 regulation that the final favorable determination of Paragraph 26 is a determination of clearance eligibility in this consistent and long-standing interpretation of a regulation by the agency responsible for its drafting as we submit entitled to great way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.121" offset="16483871">Now, petitioner contends however, that he should not be -- that he should be accepted from the necessity of a determination of clearance eligibility because he does not need a clearance in his present work.</text>

            <text syncTime="4120.841" offset="16586689">More than that however, we feel that there is a perfectly valid reason for the Department's insisting on a determination of clearance eligibility as a condition precedent to a restitution for the suspension or revocation of a clearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="4224.467" offset="17001200">There really are two important distinctions between the situation there and the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.270" offset="17032443">First, of course, we're talking about a determination of present eligibility at least under the 1955 regulation or the 1960 regulation, does require not only a finding of present eligibility but a finding that the revocation was unjustified, which we take to be a finding of past eligibility in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.354" offset="17116766">But not so under the 1955 regulation and that is the one we're applying here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.126" offset="17143829">Therefore, some of the considerations that you adverted to there, do not seem to us to be present and we do feel that -- that a -- a determination now is really very different from a determination then.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.557" offset="17197641">If for -- it -- there -- it may have been that -- that there were circumstances that would've substantively justified the denial of a clearance back, say in 1952 or 1953, but if it appears that the individual involved has -- has done nothing of this general character in -- in the meantime, thus, adding some -- some kind of color to the -- to the prior activities, this is certainly a fact that would have to be taken into account in a -- in a present adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.253" offset="17332433">The same standards just -- just don't apply when there's a significant difference in time of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.516" offset="17357406">Now, secondly, and really I think critically as far as what you've said in Silver is concerned, I assume from reading what you said that that was a -- a construction of the legislation that was before the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.387" offset="17432952">And what we have here is a regulation that in or judgment as clearly as a regulation could set forth the fact that this kind of determination is to be made and unless if it said that what you've said in Silver is a constitutional requirement, we believe that the plain language of the regulation must control.</text>

            <text syncTime="4404.249" offset="17720404">Certainly, this Court in Greene against McElroy did not purport to determine that petitioner was entitled to a clearance as I pointed out, Mr. Justice Harlan in his concurring opinion was it taints to emphasize that and I quote, "There is nothing in the Court's opinion which suggest the petitioner must be given access to classify the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.009" offset="17803368">Nor is there any intimation in Judge Keech's order on remand that he intended to declare petitioner's entitlement to a clearance."</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.589" offset="17833775">And as I have said, the regulation itself clearly contemplates that the determination will be made by an administrative board or official.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.421" offset="17873063">The short of our argument is that it is clear beyond doubt that the final favorable determination of Paragraph 26 is a determination of clearance eligibility that can be passed on only by the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.719" offset="17938265">By ceasing final favorable determination and taking it entirely out of context, petitioner has been able to make this argument which is in essence that any final favorable determination that he lay his hands on will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.624" offset="18009840">As far as we are concerned, in relation to this regulation, the final favorable determination of this Court and of Judge Keech on remand is -- is no more relevant than any other determination that petitioner might be able to find.</text>
