            <text syncTime="19.669" offset="182000">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.991" offset="199346">This litigation was designed to comply with the mandates of this Court and it was filed in 1961, with Roth and in particular with respect to Marcus.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.657" offset="262040">We prepared the litigation in my office with the anticipation in that it might well be before this Court as is the case of so many of these obscenity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.399" offset="312926">The statute in Kansas, the language is taken exactly from the approved charge in the Roth case, charge to the Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.144" offset="355976">The forum was a capable, young judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.071" offset="371649">It had been suggested here yesterday that this was sort of a kangaroo proceeding in Kansas, this was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.646" offset="397981">As a matter of fact in overruling the demurrer to the evidence the judge, Judge Fletcher said that his personal views coincided exactly with those of Mr. Justice Black as suggested in the Smith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.911" offset="467048">The judge was handed a copy of Marcus at the time he was presented with the information and if the Court will consider the transcripts in this proceeding, the Court will find that all the constitutional questions that are here before this Court were litigated at the trial level and then re-litigated at the state level and that the trial court meticulously answered the objections raised by counsel throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.839" offset="622738">The purpose of filing this action was to reach the evil that 50 states have considered to be an evil in the federal government, namely that matter of obscenity and this case involves that the business of purveying of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.543" offset="713540">It's now a part of a $2 billion business.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.292" offset="732557">As a matter of fact it's -- it's my feeling that this is really as much a Ferguson versus Skrupa proposition as it is a First Amendment proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.150" offset="964002">What the state here is trying to do is to make Roth workable and what we hope to accomplish by having this Court affirm the procedure in that case, in this case at bar, so that the prosecutors will have some definite or delicate tools with which to work in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.887" offset="1066924">It's a concern to me as attorney general and I am sure it is my colleagues who are prosecutors that the business of smut peddling has reached such propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.320" offset="1124603">The question that's considered yesterday with respect to the procedure, considered the question as to probable cause as to whether or not as a matter of law, the trial judge could have found from his consideration of these six books that these additional books were obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.449" offset="1317177">It doesn't take a directory to find the sexual passages in these little books. Now these books were presented, the six, to the trial judge and here is one of them, ‘The Wife Swappers,' on the first page it says, ‘The Wife Swappers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="319.567" offset="1381648">In bold print it says, “Members of this lust club had a different woman every night.”</text>
            <text syncTime="324.752" offset="1402337">You turn to the fly leaf and it says, ‘lust sated couples' and in big letters, ‘these eight couples are members of a wife-swapping, mate-switching sex club, so vile it will stun you.'</text>
            <text syncTime="336.851" offset="1450820">On the next page it says, the wife swappers, ‘This is an original night stand book.”</text>
            <text syncTime="341.384" offset="1468897">On the next page, ‘Printed and bound in United States of America.'</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.969" offset="11155205">In several sentences and first of all I don't want say it has high social value, but I think that any book that communicates ideas has some value in it to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.992" offset="11195329">They have entertainment value, for those people who cannot read Tropic of Cancer or cannot read Lady Chatterley's Lover because they have a limited educational background, its serves for them something like the same function that literature serves for the more educated, and there is class basis that's going on here Your Honor that I think is invidious and ought to be dealt with seriously, and that is apparently if you are educated you could have a certain amount of sexual titillation, but you may not if you are a truck driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.077" offset="11307656">That seems to be the thrust that is going on here that there was no Shakespeare is true, but there -- as I say if you look at the news stands generally, you will find that there is not much of great value, of all of the books that are published in the course of the year I doubt that 1% will survive for a five year period, and that cannot be the test for First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.161" offset="11396054">Moreover physiologists tell us that there is (Inaudible) value, that people do live under a great deal of pressure and one of the pressure are is the sexual repression that they are living under and there is an importance in being able to read about matters that people are thinking about anyhow, and I do believe that this Court make a serious error in the constant use of the word filth and dirt for books which do nothing more then arouse sexual desires, because that's all the claim is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.926" offset="11523114">Kansas doesn't anything else except that these books arouse sexual desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.132" offset="11539937">Now if the arousing of sexual desires is such an evil, I think we're in a pretty bad way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.877" offset="11562924">I think that we make a mistake in categorizing books, if we take the Attorney General's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.416" offset="11589047">He says it's a business of $2 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.013" offset="11607437">That means that every man, woman, and child in this country is spending $20, $20 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.129" offset="11639933">If you take a family of five that's a $100 a year, now it can't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.382" offset="11660936">It can't be that there is that many people who are so corrupt and if we're taking as a standard that if a work does not go beyond what society tolerates, I think that with learning that society tolerates a great deal of discussion about sex and rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.017" offset="11731466">And I think that the notion that the problem is easily solved by the prosecution Mr. Chief Justice is and with serious criminal penalties like 25 years and the like, is to invade the First Amendment rights even more seriously if I may say so in this proceeding because people will be so afraid to distribute books that deal with sex, that they will stay away from the whole field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.526" offset="11829478">I know if I'm advising a book publisher and I know that he is going to go jail for 25 years or some such number of years, I would tell him to publish a cook book and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.479" offset="11877334">And I'll say this, and it's a deterrent because Mr. Henry Miller who is the author as Your Honors know of a Tropic of Cancer has been indicted in New York and there are attempts being made now to extradite him from California to New York for the purpose of standing trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.796" offset="11946506">There is enormous amount of terror that is going on with these prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.353" offset="11968763">Kansas happens to be more concerned as I would see with civil rights now through these proceedings as evil as they are, than some of the other states that go on with the criminal prosecutions, that are wrongly brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.081" offset="12043682">By that I mean that there are states which will go after book after book criminally, throwing people in jail and denying them bail and this happens regularly on books that we know are constitutionally protected and finally we do get a vindication in the appellate courts and then the courts are criticized as Your Honor says, but wrongly criticized because the Courts are only doing their constitutional duty in giving some protection, but --</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.612" offset="12153814">Of course I can understand Mr. Fleishman that of the two you are clients would rather lose their books and go to jail and that's exactly the point that I was making that from a standpoint of law enforcement, if there was honest law enforcement they would prosecute these people, but I don't agree with you that the mere fact that that is a possibility under the law that all the book shops are going to close anymore than all -- than the stock market is going to close because there is regulation of securities and anyone who sells a fraudulent security may go to jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.827" offset="12314728">Look there is this difference Mr. Chief Justice Warren and that is that there is really a very serious constitutional difficulty in the sense that nobody does know what obscenity is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.879" offset="12358928">Your Honors have sat here now for two days and in the facts that Your Honors really don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.543" offset="12381497">Now, if Your Honors don't know what obscenity is, then the burden has shifted back to the intermediate appellate Courts, you hope that they are going to know, but how is the intermediate appellate Court going to know if Your Honors don't know?</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.983" offset="12427264">So they shifted back to the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.009" offset="12435414">They say, well the Trail Court is going to know, but the truth of the matter is that when there was a determination that a word is obscene, whether that be in a proceeding such as we have here now, which is a civil proceeding or whether it's in a criminal proceeding, the truth is that it is always an ex parte determination, not ex parte, it is ex post facto, you have what Mr. Justice Hand said, ad hoc legislation, a trier of fact for reasons that are never explained besides that the particular book or the particular books should not circulate, and because there are so many subjective factors that go in there, there's very little room for any effective appellate review because the appellate Court say as Your Honors have said, how do we know one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.956" offset="12615241">So you come down to really sending people to jail under no law at all, expect the old law that they had in Germany, which is, if it's bad for the society at large, that's all it is, how does that differ from what Mr. Ferguson says here that if the defense generally -- if it generally offends notions of decency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.392" offset="12684936">Now we couldn't have a political test that would say that if a book was politically offensive to the majority of the people, that it is to be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.523" offset="12717432">I would suggest Your Honor that the problem that we have here can be solved and should be solved by saying that speech which deals with sex should be treated exactly the same as we treat speech that deals with other troublesome areas, politics, religion, economics, and have the same test applicable if there is some link between conduct and the books then and only then can there be suppression, but to say that you can suppress a work because it arouses a sexual thought, Kansas doesn't even say it's a bad sexual thought, just that it arouses sexual thoughts, that I submit Your Honor is a deep intrusion into First Amendment and cannot stand.</text>
