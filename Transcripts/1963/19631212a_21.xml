            <text syncTime="12.595" offset="153788">Yesterday Justice White asked whether the company's right to go to the board and to obtain a board adjudication of the controversy did not take a lot of sting out of what we said where the undesirable elements of bilateral arbitration, and thereby militate against a construction of Section 301 which we speak for.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.745" offset="262353">I would like to elaborate on what I said yesterday, because I think that if there is such a mitigation, we are faced with a peculiar circularity, if the grievance is arbitrable, if 301 must be construed as my adversaries contend, and we go to the board, the day the 301 action has commenced, the board certainly would not enjoin the 301 action nor it would have authority to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.363" offset="460779">The court would not state a 301 action because of the reversal of this decision here now, and then we would proceed through the arbitration, and get an award, the IUE would get an award under this hypothesis and I think it is proper to assume for purposes of analysis that the board determination is contrary to the arbitrator's award, we then have the same conflict at that juncture that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.209" offset="604244">One would think that the arbitrator's award would become nullified by a contrary board award, but the basis of Mr. Sigal's position is that that the arbitrator's award gives him a contract right which is heretically different from the board determination of a statutory right, but you cannot avoid the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.624" offset="701837">Now, I think it was assumed yesterday that, of course, the arbitrator's award would fall against a contrary board award, but if this distinction between contract right and statutory right is valid, it is not entirely clear that the arbitrator's award would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.954" offset="783235">Now, the Congress did speak in the statute fairly directly on the subject of conflict between board determinations and determinations from any other source, not excluding arbitration and that section I referred to was Section 10 (a), I referred to it in my brief at Page 32; 10(a) â€“</text>

            <text syncTime="200.583" offset="905697">Of the brief Page 32, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.794" offset="922520">10 (a) which goes back to the Wagner Act provides that the power of the board to prevent unfair labor practices, matters cognizable under 8 shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.030" offset="1007470">Now, the omission of any -- here Congress is addressing itself the conflict and it talks only about conflict with an unfair labor practice concurrency.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.083" offset="1051669">There is no statement whatsoever to cover the situation of a conflict between a unit determination under Section 9 and a determination of the same controversy by some other means of adjustment established by agreement such as arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.633" offset="1125857">Do we infer from 10 (a) that the board's power over units is not paramount?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.806" offset="1162637">I think the board's power over units is the most unreviewable administrative determination that exists virtually in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.076" offset="1195656">The board's discretion over units is one of the most unfettered agency discretions in our federal administrative system.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.004" offset="1231391">I think I infer that Congress could not even conceive of there being a conflict between a board-determined unit and a unit-determined determined by some other means of adjustment, agreement or a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.690" offset="1306102">I don't think Congress could conceive of this situation and had it done so, it certainly would have elaborated in 10 (a) when it addressed itself to the subject of concurrency and conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.399" offset="1356988">From that I inferred that Congress did not intend that 301 be used to have an arbitrator review, or court makes no difference, review a board-determined unit and that is exactly what the review sought here concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.510" offset="1425429">There is another aspect of this idea that the two proceedings can go along concurrently without doing any harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.995" offset="1467329">If we are wrong, we have no right to force the union into court under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.752" offset="1494392">There shouldn't have been an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.947" offset="1499199">We should have just agreed to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.514" offset="1509439">We should've proceeded with arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.396" offset="1520933">Now if the harm, we say, should be avoided by affirmance here can equally be avoided by our going to the board and if the reason that is an -- would be an adequate answer is that the arbitrator may not proceed and avoid and resolve, I first referred to, do we have -- but because of reversal here, we go into arbitration; we don't force the union to go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.461" offset="1653217">We go the board but to stop the arbitration, we ourselves have to go to court as well as to the board for declaratory judgment under 301 that the arbitrator should not be proceeding and therefore, should be enjoined from proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.281" offset="1712462">So I think you can't avoid the question of whether there is a conflict, whether the exercise of this concurrent jurisdiction presents a sufficiently serious problem that should not be permitted in the overall scheme of orderly adjustment of labor disputes.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.269" offset="1956446">-- at least, and here where there are two outstanding orders which are report to be neutrally exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.549" offset="1985599">Now, another factor I would like to bring into this argument is we keep talking about arbitration and the reason why arbitration will be helpful here, it may induce the federation to acquiescence loss of jobs or people, whatever maybe involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.743" offset="2066369">It may be helpful to the board when the controversy ultimately comes before the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.878" offset="2086849">Now if you look at the agreement, the collective bargaining agreement, arbitration is the last step following a four-step grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.122" offset="2143901">The normal way to handle plant controversies is not to go to an arbitrator; it's to go to shop steward, supervisor, grievance and so on up to the national grievance level.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.104" offset="2199803">When the grievance procedures, which are highly favored by Congress, break down, when they don't work, then you go to arbitration, but if the union is right here and I think Justice Brennan perhaps had this in mind in one of his questions yesterday, well supposing we had agreed at the grievance level here, supposing we had agreed with the IUE's contentions and then transferred the workers or employees, we wouldn't have solved any problems because then the case would be here captioned federation against Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.266" offset="2348387">I mean we just can't agree at the grievance procedure, at the grievance level to this type of bilateral adjustment of a trilateral dispute; we just can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.857" offset="2390810">But in theory, if the arbitrator can do it in his award, we can do it as a grievance level.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.908" offset="2422993">Now as in the side, we do not have an umpire for the industry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.937" offset="2451101">We have arbitrators selected on an ad hoc basis on a AAA list, and I don't demean them at all, but I do object to the demeaning of the board's expertise in this area, and the reference to the board as an agency reviewing on paper records in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.091" offset="2551724">In legal theory, the decision is the board's, but there is certainly a reality that the initial decisional power is delegated to a hearing officer and they sit all over the country and they can go into plants and they do go into plants and they have full process over parties and over evidence which an arbitrator does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.056" offset="2651617">This contract arbitrator does not have full process powers over evidence let alone other parties and witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.330" offset="2680665">So it's the board hearing examiner that the arbitrator is competing with here, not the board itself and the board hearing examiner is certainly expert with the same kind of problem of job classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.466" offset="2741269">He is an expert on the board's Section 9 criteria, and they must be involved here because all these rights and relations depend on propriety of unit, an issue which can only be decided under Section 9 criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.906" offset="2803022">Now if my adversaries are right, there is no exception to arbitrability here.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.944" offset="2827160">They talk about the one or two employee case, but I could talk about a case that came out of arbitration after my brief was filed, and I think it is a good case to consider here.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.122" offset="2887868">It is reported at this year's Daily Labor Reports, number 155 at Page D1 that's the October 7th.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.553" offset="2933635">DLR 195 Page D1 involves the UNIVAC division of Remington Rand.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.082" offset="2975744">The employer had a plan in Utica for which IUE, petitioner here, was a certified representative of production and maintenance workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.746" offset="3010330">It had another plant at a fairly close by town called Ilion at which IAM machinist union is.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.180" offset="3036139">It was a certified representative of production and maintenance workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.633" offset="3049932">It unilaterally closed down the Utica plant and consolidated operations at Ilion.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.292" offset="3076577">It offered all the Utica employees jobs at Ilion, but continued to recognize the machinist at Ilion in respect of all employees and putting those transferred from the IUE jurisdiction at the Utica plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.728" offset="3154317">IUE sought arbitration and the employer there and I would like to go back to steel workers, this Court said in steel workers, unless you bargain away your right to a judicial determination, you have it, but there is nothing wrong with letting the arbitrator decide arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.642" offset="3233938">That's also, that would be subject to review on this award, but it's the difference in procedure here.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.299" offset="3260583">But that went to the arbitrator, but the employer contested on the grounds of arbitrability, not on the merits as we did in the 301 action involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.297" offset="3304573">Now here he concluded that the grievance was not arbitrable and he did not do so on the basis of legal precedent and feel bound by the New York Court of Appeals' decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.503" offset="3349400">He didn't feel himself bound by precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.860" offset="3366849">He said that it was non-arbitrable in his view, because of the simple fact that in Utica, there is a legally certified union with the exclusive right to represent all production and maintenance of employees of the Utica plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.330" offset="3428707">He said that any reasonable person would have to conclude that a verdict favoring IUE would constitute an attack on the certification scope of the Utica IAM unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.521" offset="3485445">Once this simple fact is acknowledged, it places the issue on proper perspective namely, which union is entitled to represent the transferees and under whose agreement all the rights and responsibilities be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.064" offset="3535600">This is clearly a representation question and one for the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.446" offset="3557125">I can appreciate the hardship involved here, but I note that in denying arbitrability of the grievance nothing in this opinion should be construed as prejudicial to whatever rights the union may have in the proper arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.799" offset="3622536">So he just made an arbitrability determination, and he said that his view as matter of logic and common sense, this was not an arbitrable grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.780" offset="3654510">Now he is not bound by 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.608" offset="3669765">I don't have significant values, but arbitrators are, they are powered to rise under 301, but they are not bound by 301, but I think we have to have a common standard of arbitrability between arbitrators and the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.835" offset="3718666">It shouldn't make any difference who determines arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.768" offset="3742490">If you look at the Utica-Ilion situation, if you, as the contract matter said, IUE has the continued right to represent former Utica employees at Ilion in this merged production and maintenance unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.873" offset="3818872">It just couldn't work, it is just chaotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.616" offset="3829844">You can't have two bargaining representatives for the same group of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.498" offset="3849383">It is a fundamental breakdown on the whole concept of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.584" offset="3865684">I mean mine is the cornerstone of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.170" offset="3880103">There's got to be an election district, an appropriate election, an election of a bargaining representative, and then the employer deals with the bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.341" offset="3920750">And you just can't have it unclear who represents whom in the shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.675" offset="3946036">Now that case is more dramatic than my case because we're not dealing with an entire plan; we're dealing with the engineering laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.281" offset="3988459">I'm not saying that this is a question of degree; I think it's a question of principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.985" offset="4023359">If the thrust of a grievance is the enlargement of representational jurisdiction, no matter what other labels you've put on, it should not be arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.981" offset="4063274">Now, it has been said that everybody in this case agrees, it doesn't make any difference than what you call a grievance, and I agree with that too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.230" offset="4104338">It doesn't make any difference what you call this grievance, but that does not mean that I'm taking the position that any work assignment grievance is arguable, as Solicitor General Cox gave the example of a run of a mill dispute in which the employer threw in the proposition, well this fellow is a supervisor anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.991" offset="4195349">Now that doesn't deter arbitrability in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.268" offset="4212485">If the issue truly is whether he is a supervisor, it is a status determination, which I would think would have to be made on the act, but I don't have to go so far in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.388" offset="4256893">I say that the status of collective bargaining representative has to be determined by the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.438" offset="5681089">Now if you have an arbitrator's award, Mr. Cox has said, well, there is a problem in segregating out arbitrable relations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.923" offset="6271039">There has been a great deal of speculation about what the end product of a number of postulated alternatives maybe and I'm afraid the facts in this case have been lost in this cloud of speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.902" offset="6334986">Now it has been assumed that this is a representation case in which the union is seeking to its largest unit thatÂ is not the fact and it is not in our view of representation case in any respect, but let us recall your attention, Your Honors, to the statements of the issue as set forth in the affidavit of the petitioner at Page 36 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.372" offset="6440835">Now there it is pointed out and nowhere denied in the answering affidavit of the company that what happened here was that after the contract, after the certification, after the contract was signed, the company for the first time moved the work, moved production and maintenance work out of the unit represented by the petitioner into the engineering laboratory and it is also asserted that they moved employees represented by the petitioner over into the engineering laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.628" offset="6617840">So you have here asserted and nowhere denied in the answering affidavits that there was a transfer of work, there was a work assignment which was alleged to be in violation of the agreement, that is nowhere denied so that must be considered to be the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.128" offset="6687848">Therefore, there is, as we see it, unquestionably a work assignment dispute here and there may or may not be some questions as to whether the employees, who were transferred, were actually production and maintenance workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.806" offset="6758588">Now that is a question of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.934" offset="6799130">The unit represented by the petitioner is the production and maintenance unit excluding salaried, clerical and technical employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.409" offset="6848972">The unit represented by the federation as the salaried technical and clerical employees excluding all production and maintenance workers.</text>
