            <text syncTime="21.809" offset="190568">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.359" offset="204779">This is a case involving the application of the Mapp, Giordenello and Ker decision from this Court, the application of the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States as they apply in criminal proceedings in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.033" offset="311463">The facts briefly are this.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.636" offset="317942">Nick Aguilar was arrested by virtue of a combination of search and arrest warrant on January the 8th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.470" offset="377292">This was a combined federal and state undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.044" offset="399548">There were two federal officers present and participated in the search and the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.502" offset="425357">There were also about six state officers who also participated in the arrest and search.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.365" offset="460884">According to the State's evidence, the two police officers, on or about January the 8th, 1960, received what they described in court as reliable information from a credible source, that Nick Aguilar would have some heroin in his possession at his -- at his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.473" offset="585226">They went to Judge Regan who was Justice of Harris County.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.495" offset="601318">They piped out a -- an affidavit and a search warrant prior to going to Judge -- Justice Regan.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.450" offset="633187">Justice Regan executed the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.445" offset="645204">He took the affidavit and executed the -- or gave them the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.046" offset="663594">They proceeded to Aguilar's home out in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.831" offset="686686">There, they knocked on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.452" offset="701210">There was conflict in the evidence as to whether or not they said they were police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.730" offset="722317">They did, however, -- one -- one of the officers said, "We knocked on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.004" offset="751365">We heard some activity inside."</text>
            <text syncTime="166.157" offset="767979">They made a forced entry and acting pursuant to the arrest portion of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.291" offset="796505">They run through the home and collared, and the defendant took him into custody in the bathroom where they said they found that he was attempting to flush the contraband down the commode.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.823" offset="870693">They recovered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.600" offset="877798">This was the extent of the evidence introduced in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.448" offset="905174">The defendant was tried the first time in February of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.337" offset="928684">The case was reversed in the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.687" offset="938088">He was tried the second time in 1962, I believe it was, in the state court in June of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.101" offset="975809">A motion for rehearing was filed latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.924" offset="991065">Then in July the 3rd, a second motion for rehearing was filed in November of 1962 or rather it was overruled in November of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.375" offset="1044877">In the meantime, the federal authorities had also indicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.349" offset="1068805">And in January of 1962, he was put to trial for the same offense in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.910" offset="1111019">However, that issue is not before this Court because he was acquitted in the federal court but he was not sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.277" offset="1144456">He was convicted in September, if I -- my recollection serve me correctly, and he was not sentenced until the following January.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.997" offset="1183326">In the meantime, the federal prosecution was about to begin on January the 22nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.903" offset="1214986">Our main complaint here and we -- we complained in the trial court that this particular affidavit and warrant wherein derogation of the Fourth and Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.216" offset="1296280">We did not to get any real consideration from the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.685" offset="1318118">His remarks concerning the federal standard are on page 21 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.641" offset="1345912">He -- I apprised him of the decision of Mapp versus Ohio from this Court and he said, "Counsel, will you give me some cases from the Court of Criminal Appeals on this matter?"</text>
            <text syncTime="327.838" offset="1414771">And this was the extent of his concern over these federal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.088" offset="1431698">Now, we -- he -- the Court indicated that he was not familiar with Mapp and I tendered the decision to him and I was summarily overruled.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.335" offset="1608704">And again, at great length, we went into this issue of whether or not this affidavit satisfied the requirements of the federal standard and whether or not, this was, in fact, a writ of assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.138" offset="1663875">And I submit to the Court that this is, in fact, a writ of assistance that was condemned as far back as Entick versus Carrington.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.287" offset="8608475">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.566" offset="8625612">This Court on many occasions as stated in many of the cases in search and seizure that it is better to place the magistrate between the citizens and the officers who go out to make a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.756" offset="8678379">Of course, obviously in this case, that is precisely what was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.595" offset="8697710">Here, the officers, when they received the information, they did not embark upon a search of their own into a private residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.118" offset="8731878">They did not go roughshod through a man's house as it was done in the case of Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.022" offset="8763434">But what they did was to seek out a magistrate, the Justice of the Peace of Harris County, Texas and there, presented him the affidavit, which is in the record, and upon the binding of probable cause by him and referred to page 26 of the record, about the middle of the page, the justice in -- in the warrant says that, "I am satisfied that the grant exist and the probable cause is shown, and I believe in its existence, I do hereby find."</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.782" offset="8918497">So we come to -- the Court in this case, where -- is not -- it wasn't an unbridled search, it was made with process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.068" offset="8971682">Now, then the question, as I see it, is simply presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.877" offset="8986833">The issue is, was a search warrant upon probable cause within the meaning of the constitutional provisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.187" offset="9012120">And that alone is what is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.256" offset="9028420">I'd like to speak of the facts briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.319" offset="9052662">After the officers received the search warrant in this case, they went immediately as it will be shown from the record, they went immediately to the premises of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.910" offset="9091009">And there, going to the front door, they knocked on the door -- someone answered from within, "Who is there?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.635" offset="9121938">And the officers told him that they were police officers and that they had a search warrant in their possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.101" offset="9143777">No one answered the door and they heard some scuffling sounds within the house and sounded as if someone was starting to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.887" offset="9178885">One of the officers at that time pulled and opened the screen door and opened the inner door and two of the officers pursued the petitioner through two or three rooms of the house into the bathroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.394" offset="9224965">And there he threw a cellophane package into the commode and was flushing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.746" offset="9246386">One of the officers grappled with the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.136" offset="9255894">The other retrieved the cellophane package from which they took six packages of white powder which was later determined to be a high grade of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.240" offset="9308348">The petitioner was then indicted to Harris County Grand Jury and was soon brought to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.037" offset="9335515">The first trial, he entered a plea of nolo contendere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.736" offset="9350353">In that case, on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals was reversed and the reason would be that the plea of nolo contendere was one which had been made available to defendants very recently at the time the case was tried and the Court had not admonished the petitioner of his rights under that plea and that was the reason for its first reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.062" offset="9443662">He received 20 years sentence in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.055" offset="9459545">Coming back to the trial court, it soon tried again and their plea of not guilty -- on a plea of not guilty, punishment of 20 years was assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.319" offset="9500609">The case was duly appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.135" offset="9523911">And although the case was not briefed and argued before the Court of Criminal Appeals on its original submission, the Court did consider the point which is an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.262" offset="9564453">Judge Belcher, writing the opinion for the Court, found that there were sufficient facts stated within the affidavit upon which -- which would show probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.911" offset="9622967">The appellant filed a motion for rehearing and in much more detailed discussion of this problem of probable search or probable cause and the unlawful search, which was asserted by the appellant, was made by Judge Morrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.646" offset="9693915">There, Judge Morrison discussed, and in light of Mapp versus Ohio, acknowledged that the Court of Criminal Appeals certainly, I don't think there's any question about it, but he said there wasn't any hesitancy of the duty to follow the rules of the Supreme Court of the United States citing cases there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.529" offset="9781478">And there has been some discussion of Rule 727a of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Texas in what it means and how it affects this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.297" offset="9828603">It'd be my position here that it would -- would not affect this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.039" offset="9851486">The Court of Criminal Appeals -- it is a procedural statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.757" offset="9866428">The Court of Criminal Appeals had determined its application in Texas and I believe that this Court would be precluded for making a different determination insofar as that article is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.567" offset="9929644">Furthermore, there would be nothing -- should this case be decided upon the basis of 727a which Mr. Woody has indicated that he thinks could be done and then would make it applicable to Texas only perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.355" offset="9988786">There's nothing to prevent the legislature from changing that rule, should this Court decide to decide it on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.890" offset="10018983">And furthermore, as we've said, I doubt that -- that any different construction could be made even by the Court of Criminal Appeals of that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.393" offset="10092962">Now, the petitioner here relies mainly upon the case of Giordenello versus United States which was decided in this Court in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.197" offset="10136116">It's my understanding of the case that it was decided upon the basis of Rules 3 and 4 of the Code of Criminal -- of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.353" offset="10184808">Question has been asked as -- and there has been some discussion as to whether they include more than the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.673" offset="10234023">I would submit that there was no reason to have these rules if they did not add something to those constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.907" offset="10271013">And certainly, I do not think it can be argued that Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure have any application to the state courts in their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.080" offset="10315734">Now, this argument, of course, is made by analogy because I believe it would be Rule 41 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which would apply where a search warrant is obtained rather than an arrest warrant, as it's provided for in articles -- in -- in Rules 3 and 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.660" offset="10518026">I have to turn to the page 24, I believe it is, where the search -- the affidavit for the search warrant is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.553" offset="10561599">There maybe some difficulty I think, it's been partially explained here that this is printed form or portions of it are printed forms in the affidavit and the warrant appear upon the same page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.296" offset="10628577">We would say as it has been suggested already that what we said here that the affiants have received reliable information from a credible person and do believe that heroin, marijuana, barbiturates and other narcotics, narcotic paraphernalia are being kept, the above described premises for the purpose of sale and use contrary to the provisions of law that it's a shorthand rendition for saying that they -- when they say reliable information, that means from a reliable source or reliable person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.291" offset="10768488">The term "credible person" means the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.778" offset="10782490">It would be -- I do not know how they could detail it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.612" offset="10801821">If they did detail it and describe the person, I do not know how it would make a great deal of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.832" offset="10874650">And as I've indicated, there is a disagreement between petitioner and the State in this case as to the application of the rules -- of Federal Rules and Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.168" offset="10919999">We think that the rules place a higher standard on federal prosecutions than would the constitutional provisions in and of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.648" offset="10962004">And as I've stated, I do not know why it would be necessary to have the rules if they did not do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.072" offset="10999620">Again, I -- didn't your Court of Criminal Appeal implicitly agree with that when they -- when they said that the case of (Inaudible) against the United States from the Fourth Circuit if it's cited to them and that case, it was held that a warrant wasn't sufficient under 41 (c) and they implied that if 41 -- that 41 (c) imposed a higher standard in the Fourth Amendment standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.110" offset="11103796">Yes, Your Honor, they specifically considered that particular federal rule in that portion that is 41 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.627" offset="11165863">After a careful analysis of the cases from this Honorable Court, I have concluded that there's actually no case upon which the petitioner may rely or upon which would decide the precise issue that is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.422" offset="11245066">And I think that, actually, that there is an area which this Court has not -- up to this time, has not actually covered because the Giordenello case, as I tried to indicate, I believe, does not cover this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.806" offset="11294595">It's specifically was a federal prosecution from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.849" offset="11314761">So I think that -- that what this Court will find necessary to do in this case is to actually go into some new territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.050" offset="11363558">Now, the petitioners said here that hearsay is not sufficient to -- to establish probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.992" offset="11407339">We know that this contention has been held against him by the case of Draper and Jones and perhaps other cases which have held that hearsay is enough to establish probably cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.480" offset="11457285">Another question that has arisen, what is a standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.511" offset="11469406">Should there be any different standard between arrest without a warrant and one with a warrant, insofar as probable cause is concerned?</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.500" offset="11513396">If anything it should require less to obtain search warrant and I think this Court has so indicated, I believe, in the case of Wong Sun, which was quite recently decided, that we cannot be more stringent with the requirements to obtain a search warrant than to embark upon a search on probable cause alone to -- so hold would be to encourage officers then not to obtain search warrants but to go ahead and embark upon their search and run rough -- roughshod over the citizen area immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.244" offset="11676400">Now, there are many practical problems, I think, that will be involved in -- in the decision of this case, as it's been said that probable cause, as the name implies, you're dealing with probabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.332" offset="11736691">They are factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.260" offset="11740453">Practical considerations are involved and people in their everyday work or officers in their everyday work have to make very rapid decisions and their decisions that a reasonably proved man should make and not as legal technicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.505" offset="11817357">That wording has been used in many of the cases from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.838" offset="11838673">Now, I'm going to say something that question whether probable cause in such case as this must be shown from the four corners of the affidavit in a state case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.962" offset="11899173">I agree that this Court has so held there and I think it's been uniformly held in all of the federal cases that it must be so shown in the federal cases but that is because of the federal rule which requires that at least stated in the affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.170" offset="12196028">It further answered your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.027" offset="12207522">It's my understanding that when a search warrant is issued by a magistrate --</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.144" offset="12275963">I'd -- I preface my remarks that I would probably draw a number of questions on this, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.535" offset="12297488">And one of the things I would like to say is this, that when a magistrate issues a search warrant, it's my understanding that he is actually making a judicial determination at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.817" offset="12338657">And I think as a practical matter, these -- the magistrate, many times, I think it's common knowledge that they know the officers who applied for these search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.206" offset="12384214">I think its everyday commonsense to say if I were a magistrate and a man comes in and asks for a search warrant, an officer, some officers are more believable than others, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.098" offset="12439803">And I think that the magistrate has the right when the affidavit is brought to him to ask additional questions and make determinations as to whether or not, there -- there would be sufficient probable cause in addition to what is stated in the affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.517" offset="12537396">But to -- to be completely candid with -- with, Your Honor, Mr. Woody, I believe in -- in the trial court, brought out the fact that there had been some time laps from the time that they received part of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.253" offset="12592358">The officer said the first information that we received is on the 1st of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.955" offset="12615241">He had then, of course, asked him why they did not obtain search warrant immediately and he said that they wanted time to set up a surveillance and they did not obtain the search warrant until the 8th of January, one week later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.108" offset="12675845">In my brief, I -- I wanted to take advantage of whatever that would be and honestly, I think that there is no more than what is stated there in the reference in the -- in the record where you were reading when Mr. Woody was making his argument, I think it's the only place that that appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.020" offset="12759437">Unfortunately, it's not in the record if there was any surveillance and if there were any other facts that might help with this problem but they are not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.093" offset="12799770">And to be perfectly fair, I don't -- the trial court did follow the state law while in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.652" offset="12833938">Just before closing, I do want to correct one impression that may have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.655" offset="12850030">The trial court did not arbitrarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.185" offset="12868106">He said that he hadn't read the case of Mapp at the time this case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.726" offset="12882317">But I believe on page 22, it indicates there that counsel did give him the case and they did read it and did consider it before making his ruling.</text>
