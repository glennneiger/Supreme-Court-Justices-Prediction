            <text syncTime="335.013" offset="1443401">And in fact, it does seem to us, in terms of this, that what has happened is that the State was making it possible in terms of its amendments to its laws for local counties to decide for themselves whether they wanted to abide by the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.690" offset="1510170">The State itself, since the school closing law was declared unconstitutional in James v. Bowman, has enacted laws apparently to leave this matter to the local parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.279" offset="1576521">Now we feel that what really is happening in this case is that the Prince Edward County, Prince Edward County has said “We'll close the schools rather than have schools operating and functioning.”</text>
            <text syncTime="383.413" offset="1637021">We say to the Court that this cannot be done, that this is the State is operating, the State is functioning and that the State is required to obey and abide by the Constitution, that the schools cannot be closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.074" offset="2619643">Well it seems to me, that on that -- that there's no question, but that there has been a denial and frustration right.</text>

            <text syncTime="861.582" offset="3549706">The United States joins the petitioners in urging that the judgment below in this case be reversed and that the case be sent back with instructions to grant relief necessary to bring about a reopening of the public schools in Prince Edward County.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.254" offset="3624417">I shall argue the case in somewhat technical terms introduced by the respondents, but not because that is the whole case, but because it seems to me important to show that even on their own ground, their arguments when closely examined, are lacking in the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.658" offset="3702053">The Court will not forget, I'm sure, even though I don't mention it again, that this case is ultimately concerned with probably the greatest of injustices, the denial of -- and equal education to children because of racial considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.393" offset="3772897">Now as we see it, the case has two, somewhat different parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.067" offset="3795675">The first concerns the situation that obtained while the tax credits, the scholarships, and the tuition grants were enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.836" offset="3838725">And it seems quite clear that with the public schools in the county closed, now I don't go beyond it, that with the public schools in the county closed and public schools being operated by the State in every other county, that the main -- that the contribution of state funds to this white foundation school is clearly within Cooper and Aaron, and that there's nothing more to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.438" offset="3937155">The more difficult part of the case, although I think not difficult when one analyzes it clearly, is when one creates it on the supposition that there is no financial aid being given to the children or through them to the foundation school.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.873" offset="4014895">As we see it, this branch of the case rests upon a very simple theory that if you keep it clearly in mind dissolves all the complexities that have been so much argued about.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.602" offset="4073827">The schools of Prince Edward County have been closed solely because of the policy of denying the children who live in that county, any public education rather than giving them an equal public education as required by this Court's mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.330" offset="4144671">And we submit that for officials exercising state power to deny children who live in Prince Edward County any public education, upon such a grant, while granting it to all other children in the state, constitutes an invidious discrimination, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment between children who live in Prince Edward County and children who live outside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.682" offset="4414151">I will develop, Mr. Justice Stewart, at some length two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.284" offset="4436511">First, that here the only ground suggested for the differentiation is the purpose to perpetuate inequality in educational opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.721" offset="4490219">And second, that assuming one could go behind that, or that that was irrelevant, that in this case there is suggested and cannot be presumed to be any differences in local conditions or local needs such as would justify some of the exercises of local options that have been suggested in the opinions below and here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.928" offset="4579035">I'm going to develop that as we go along, but those seemed to me to be the two essential points in discussing local option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.586" offset="4617697">In the -- I'm going to devote my whole argument except that I would hope until the time at the end to this basic thesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.924" offset="4647058">In developing it, I start with the indisputable fact that the net effect of respondent's activities is an unconstitutional kind of discrimination against the children of Prince Edward County, in favor of the children who live everywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.764" offset="4718425">Prince Edward County children have no less need for a basic education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.419" offset="4737024">There's no suggestion that they are less educatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.672" offset="4754056">The sole ground for the differentiation is the desire to avoid having them -- having white children in the county, go to the same school as Negroes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.181" offset="4844126">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.941" offset="4847156">What I meant to say was that there are local options and local options and the fact that this local option, if it may be called that, is impermissible, does not require one to say that all local options are impermissible and I was afraid that I'd let, Your Honor, to think I was taking the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.387" offset="4924897">It depends on the local option, that is what I'm getting and trying to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.336" offset="4944750">To manifest the purpose of the basis of classification here is not acceptable under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.618" offset="4989889">Now that point was squarely decided in James and Almond, a three-judge court decision that was cited by approval in this Court in Cooper and Aaron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.817" offset="5026670">And indeed, the respondents could see that point, that if Virginia had introduced this differentiation, and by Virginia, I now mean the statewide officials, that it would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.059" offset="5083617">The whole debate here therefore, is whether the respondents, by the procedure that they have followed, can escape responsibility for what would otherwise have been a patently unconstitutional result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.251" offset="5140355">Now manifestly, anybody pressing such a proposition is that has a very heavy burden to carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.254" offset="5176404">First, I suggest that it's plain that the discrimination between these two groups of children, regardless of race, is not saved by the fact that the victims live in one county and those, with whom they are being compared, live in other counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.376" offset="5256861">While the Fourteenth Amendment does not require territorial uniformity, nevertheless, and the Fourteenth Amendment leaves a lot of room for territorial variations in the law, still, the bear fact that a discrimination conforms to county line, is not enough to make it rational and within the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.219" offset="5356231">That's the point of of course in Baker and Carr and Grand Sanders and that's the point that's been assumed, repeatedly, in decisions of this Court, examining laws that vary differently on people in different localities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.355" offset="5412760">Again, nobody really questions the fact, as the court below said, “No one questions the principle that if Virginia is operating a statewide centralized system of schools, she may not close their schools in Prince Edward County in the face of a desegregation order, while she continues to operate the schools in the other counties.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.378" offset="5500844">Here respondent's argument is that this discrimination which would be admittedly unconstitutional if the legislature did it is saved in this instance because it's accomplished by what they call local option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.897" offset="5574928">Now it might be enough to say that that contention is inconsistent with this Court's all the precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.118" offset="5603871">On at least two, I think it's fair to say three occasions, the Court has held that in making territorial variations in the treatment of citizens, the legislature has all the -- has the power to do everything that could be done by local option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.287" offset="5680567">As a matter of logic it follows, that what the legislature can't do, can't be done by local option and so, under those precedents, the contention that respondents make is contrary to the views of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.991" offset="5743365">Now it's not necessary for us to go so far as to urge that expression of local preference will never save a classification that would be unconstitutional if made by the legislator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.316" offset="5800626">It's enough for us to show, I submit, first that the mere fact of local option does not automatically take a differentiation out from under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.855" offset="5854751">And second, that the expression of local preference will not save this classification, under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.464" offset="5897279">In other words, that the court below erred in supposing that because some local options were constitutional, therefore, all local options must be constitutional, which does not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.121" offset="5943881">Plainly the local option does not automatically render the Equal Protection Clause inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.266" offset="5968436">There's no magic in the words local option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.013" offset="5983378">What the introduction of local option does is two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.911" offset="6003022">First, it fragments the power decision making processes of the State among a variety officials, some local, and some statewide and second, it provides for a referendum or other expression of local opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.195" offset="6076165">Let's see if either of those renders the Equal Protection Clause inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.755" offset="6098422">The fragmentation of state power, among statewide officials and officials with only countywide jurisdiction is patently irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.551" offset="6149622">Respondent's, if I understand them say here, that the officials in the county aren't discriminating, the supervisors aren't discriminating because they voted that no child shall have a public education and their authority is only countywide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.004" offset="6219421">Now the School Board says that, it also says “We're helpless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.414" offset="6233004">We're dependent upon the supervisors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.010" offset="6243453">And the state officials say, “We aren't discriminating because we're offering the same thing to every county.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.113" offset="6271875">And that's the ground chiefly on which the court below rested, but that, I submit, is contrary to the decisions of this Court, and indeed, I think I can say, patently fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.287" offset="6332479">The fallacy is that the act of several officials, including county officials, cannot be viewed one at a time in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.957" offset="6379186">Every respondent here, and this goes for the county supervisors, is exercising or purporting to exercise, the power and authority of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.091" offset="6419728">Every one of them is acting as and for the State so far as the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.967" offset="6455254">That's been true all the way from Virginia and Reeves to Cooper against Aaron, that the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned with the net effect of the exercise of state power and not with who doesn't or with what particular officials doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.525" offset="6541458">That principle is illustrated, perhaps, best by the cases based which involve a converse situation by the cases involving challenges under the Fourteenth Amendment, complaining that the power has been exercised by the wrong instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.746" offset="6610317">And in an early case of Missouri against Dockery, Mr. Justice Holmes said for the Court, “Rights under that amendment turn on the power of the State, no matter by what organ it acts, it is a question of the power of the State, as a whole,” and so in the converse situation it's the question of the power of the State as a whole and what its impact is in creating an unjust discrimination, not who does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.555" offset="6725569">The principle is quite clearly illustrated by a case which unfortunately is not cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.453" offset="6757230">Iowa-Des Moines Bank against Bennett in two -- Iowa-Des Moines Bank against Bennett in 284 U.S. at 239.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.706" offset="6818147">In that case, a national bank was contending that it had been subjected to discriminatory taxation, not in this case in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in violation of a federal statute that permitted the capital of national banks to be taxed equally with the capital of other monied institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.129" offset="7671933">And that's true, and I rely on that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.816" offset="7686666">There are many ways, in which, the state retains a close connection, the approval of teachers, the prescription of what the school book should be, the local superintendent of schools must come for an approved list and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.784" offset="7758555">But I've been, as I said in the beginning, I've been anxious to take this case just in the terms in which they put it and to show that even then, there is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.948" offset="7803173">So, while of course, we rely on that if necessary, I think even if those elements weren't there, the result would have to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.715" offset="7838281">Now, I mentioned that there were two elements introduced by local option, one was this fragmentation of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.995" offset="7871404">The other is -- that per se not here a local referendum but an expression of local opinion through elected officials which I will assume is the same for present purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.340" offset="7920724">But I submit that it's clear that that cap, automatically take the case out from under the Fourteenth Amendment and here, I think, was the fundamental error in the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.513" offset="7965445">The Court said, since every locality may participate, if it wishes to do so and state funds are available to each upon the same conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.154" offset="8000031">The state is even handed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.497" offset="8009331">Well, I've already mentioned that the locality is the state, as one error in that, but more than that the Fourteenth Amendment isn't concerned with the equality of treatment among localities, it's concerned with the equality treatment among people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.158" offset="8068054">These are personal rights and they are personal rights, which it has been held many times, cannot be waived by majority vote, not even by the will of the majority of the class affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.906" offset="8142973">So that the referendum doesn't destroy the individuals right, whether a white or colored child in Prince Edward County, to equality before the state with other children in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.557" offset="8217579">So that the local option, I submit, does not automatically take this case out from under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.321" offset="8256658">Then the question becomes is the denial of public schooling to Prince Edward children while giving it to other children an invidious or otherwise arbitrary classification and I point out to begin with that so far as anything in the record shows, conditions in Prince Edward County and children in Prince Edward County are just like other children in respect to the fundamental need for an education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.745" offset="8378389">And so, we say, that even if it would be assumed that there are times when the preference of the people in a particular locality, will save a classification based on residence, a lack of territorial uniformity in the law, still that the local preference will not save the classification here for two independently sufficient reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.402" offset="8484968">In the first place, this classification differentiating between people, between children, who are apparently similarly situated in every relevant respect is itself too invidious, to furnish a justification for the differentiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.871" offset="8570859">The schools were closed and this is beyond dispute because of the recitals of the school -- of the Board of Supervisors, and I don't think they deny it or have any desire to slide away from it, the schools were closed, solely to avoid giving Negro children an equal public education as this Court has defined it with white children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.115" offset="8659884">Only in the abolition of segregated education can Negro children receive true equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.738" offset="8702307">Surely, the desire to perpetuate one invidious discrimination, one inequality based on race, will not justify introducing another inequality, although that one is not based upon race, it is still an inequality and that, I submit, is the end of the case here we have so far as the substance goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.182" offset="8808051">Here, we have a classification, different treatment by the state of people who in all respect are apparently alike, and the reason for it is so unworthy as the motive in this case and it just won't serve to justify and to rationalize the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.937" offset="8895091">The state is not treating people differently in pursuit of a rational policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.766" offset="8922467">Now, I would emphasize that this, that what I have said is not inconsistent in any respect with the cases cited by the respondents which they argue, support the proposition that motive will not vitiate an otherwise constitutional act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.189" offset="9000103">Nut the cases that they cite, typically, deal with use of the commerce power and the claim was made that what Congress was interested in was not regulating commerce but accomplishing some moral objective as in lottery ticket or that in the Child Labor Tax case, that the purpose was to eliminate child labor, not to raise money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.561" offset="9089651">Those cases are different and we would fully concede that the use of a power to achieve was not -- is not vitiated by achieving some collateral objective, but here the question is whether you -- by a classification, which is at first blunt, arbitrary and unreasonable, there is something -- some policy the state is trying to achieve that justifies the classification that makes it rational and here, the state has excluded all other hypothesis by saying what their purpose is and as I said a moment ago, the purpose to perpetuate one inequality of a character that the constitution condemns certainly won't justify introducing another inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.847" offset="9294764">Nor is this in anyway inconsistent with the possibility, and I state only with the possibility but I assume it for this case, with the possibility that a state might be able to abandon all public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.767" offset="9362474">Then there would be no question, under the Equal Protection Clause, if it genuinely abandoned, but here we are concerned with the Equal Protection Clause, and the schools are operating in other parts of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.864" offset="9426840">Now, I go a step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.812" offset="9442617">I assume now, for the sake of argument, that the Supervisors are not bound by their own resolutions or that their motive is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.045" offset="9495594">Still, we submit that this discrimination cannot be saved by any expression of opinion under local option because education is a subject, in relation to which, because education is subject in relation to which the discrimination occurs is too important, and its importance too far transcends county lines to deny some children the opportunity for some education while granting it to others unless some very strong justification appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.731" offset="9654314">Here -- that my time is running terribly rapidly, I -- here, let me simply say briefly, this is not a situation in which one can presume that there are any differences in territorial or local conditions that would justify this discrimination in the cases of juvenile detention homes, and the like, they're obviously are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.448" offset="9757132">Here, it is not suggested that the schools compete with other needs of the county, for the tax dollars available, nor can it be said that education is such a local matter, that the people -- just because they want it that way, can give it to children -- they give it to their children or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.972" offset="9835290">That maybe true of speed loss or whether you'll have race tracks in the town or whiskey as the like, as Justice Holmes once said, those matters are wholly within the power of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.544" offset="9885550">Education is too fundamental, too important, and I emphasize that it transcends county lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.337" offset="9912717">If children lose three years of education, their lives will be affected by that, where ever they go or what ever they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.455" offset="9953155">And if this experiment in ignorance is continued in Prince Edward County, it will affect the whole state and not just conditions in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.613" offset="10001847">Now, taking it as established, I hurry on, that there is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, because of this discrimination between children in Prince Edward County and all other children in Virginia then it seems to us to follow that the decree must bar the continuance of that unconstitutional state of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.432" offset="10121070">The decree should require the defendants so long as Virginia furnishes public education elsewhere to take the steps necessary to furnish it to children in Prince Edward County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.507" offset="10165373">The thrust of such a decree is plainly negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.830" offset="10182719">It would enjoin an unconstitutional course of conduct and on direct parties persons purporting to exercise state authority in order to carry on an unconstitutional course of conduct may be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.446" offset="10245204">Under some circumstances, it might be possible simply to stop there and it's to be presumed that respondents, especially those who have taken an oath of office, will carry out their duties when they're laid down clearly, certainly by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.205" offset="10320227">Here, so much time has passed that we join in urging that more specific steps be spelled out in the Court's Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.758" offset="10358366">We think the supervisors should be ordered to levy the taxes necessary to provide some basic education in Prince Edward County that the Board of Education should be required to open the schools and to submit a plan for the desegregation of the schools and that the state officials should be enjoined from continuing the discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.778" offset="10918536">In that event, I suggest the doctrine doesn't apply for the reason I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.070" offset="10935672">The two have been equated quite frequently, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.279" offset="10952495">I think Hummel and Louisiana are some such names in this first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.967" offset="10975274">So we say that in terms of the counties acts -- count -- the county supervisor's action, this defense simply doesn't apply, but I think there's another and more fundamental answer to any argument based on the Eleventh Amendment or sovereign immunity, and that is, that you can't pick the decree apart and look at it bit by bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.065" offset="11075584">The remedies that are proposed here are in their thrust, negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.335" offset="11100662">Their aim as a whole at compelling the cessation of this course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.837" offset="11126680">That truly suggests that the County Supervisors should be required to levy the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.690" offset="11150085">Strictly speaking, I take it that if Virginia were disposed to give up her entire public school system then the theory we've advanced here would make it proper to release the Board of Supervisors from that obligation, but surely the Court in framing the details of its decree, vis-a-via the Supervisors, is entitled to presume that Virginia is going to continue doing what it's done all along, do its part to provide public schools for the children of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.113" offset="11299819">And if that is a false assumption and if Virginia comes in and says, “We're planning to close our entire school system despite the provisions of our Constitution, requiring the legislature to operate and maintain a system of schools throughout the state,” then will be time enough to think about modifying the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.460" offset="11385187">For the present as I say, the relief we suggest, seems to us, to be essentially negative, essentially directed at terminating an unconstitutional course of conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.781" offset="11550490">Now, the reason we think that a three-judge court is not required, the reasons are two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.786" offset="11586539">In the first place, the relief sought is not to restrain in the language of the federal statute, the enforcement or execution of a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.615" offset="11637844">The attack is upon the executive or administrative action and the action which the respondents have chosen to embark upon, not upon anything required by the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.648" offset="11705971">And the decision of this Court in Ex parte Bransford, 310 U.S. 354, 310 U.S 354, especially at 359, deals with that very point if I may read just a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.744" offset="11778382">There the challenge was that certain state taxation was discriminatory under the Fourteenth Amendment, but the state statute didn't require the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.094" offset="11823731">It resulted from the act of minor state officials and the Court said, “Variations by assessors in valuations of like property, taxable under the same statute, sufficiently marked to be discriminatory under the Constitution for valuations so large as to be confiscatory cannot properly be said to be the basis for an attack on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.713" offset="11934177">Such assessments, if made and if invalid, are so because of a wrong done by officers under the statute rather than because of the requirement of the statute itself” and I submit that that is an exact description.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.447" offset="12293204">That point is squarely covered by an opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis in the case of Labette County Commissioners versus United States which is cited in our brief, Labette County Commissioners against United States, 112 U.S. 217, 224, 225.</text>

            <text syncTime="3093.259" offset="12476374">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.682" offset="12538128">I would like at the outset of the argument of this case, sir, to see if we can agree on a few very simple and I think well-established principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.640" offset="12625899">The first is that this is a suit to redress deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States upon that fact depends the jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.435" offset="12749093">It is extremely difficult to read the brief of the petitioners and ascertain what is the right that they claim that they have been deprived of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.508" offset="12825370">It is stated in oral argument that the right is a right to equal educational opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.348" offset="12868733">That statement is contained in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.623" offset="12889840">In order to find out what are the constitutional rights that they have, it is necessary first for us to determine what this Court decided in Brown against Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.086" offset="12975731">As I understand the opinion, as it has been construed by all of the lower federal courts, the opinion was an enlargement of the liberty of people within the jurisdiction of the United States in that, it removed race as a consideration with respect to the access to and the use of public facilities, namely, public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.719" offset="13166216">Now, if that be a correct interpretation, that cannot be enlarged into a decree or a judgment that Virginia is compelled to operate public schools nor that any person is required to attend the public school or that the power of the state of Virginia to control and to modify, and to alter the methods and the means by which it provides education, is in any way is impaired by that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.431" offset="13333086">I take it further that there will be no disagreement with the proposition which has been repeatedly mentioned in the more -- most recent decisions of this Court that education is in fact an area that is reserved to the states or to the people under the Tenth Amendment, and that the states have the power and the complete power, and the whole control of education, subject of course to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and any other applicable requirements of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.333" offset="13516675">Now, what Virginia has done is not to abolish education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.383" offset="13580936">What Virginia has done is that the Constitution of Virginia, the arrangement about education is fixed in its constitution, has been there since 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.638" offset="13645928">This is no new innovation, no new power that has been reposed in local bodies, as a response to the decision in Brown against Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.187" offset="13704129">This is a power that all of the debates was fixed in the Constitution of Virginia, predicated upon a principle which I suppose all of us must recognize and that is that the success of any public educational enterprise depends upon the support and the sympathy of those who must furnish the funds and who must patronize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.634" offset="13817919">And it's upon that proposition that Virginia, when it embarked upon the course of fixing the public educational system, reposed in the local government body of each county and city the power to determine whether or not and how much it would appropriate for that purpose and reposed the administration and the operation of those schools in a local school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.351" offset="13928782">All that the state has done on the state level is to fix a plan, the outline of a probe by which the localities, if they chose to do it, could provide public education for their citizens and that has been the law in Virginia since the year 1902 under the present Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.383" offset="14036929">Now, in 1956, the Constitution of Virginia was amended, so as to permit the state and the localities to use public funds for the education of children in private non-sectarian schools located anywhere in the United States, and in public schools located outside of the community in which the child resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.243" offset="14188335">Now, the statement is made that Prince Edward has acted in this case, to mean racial motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.300" offset="14244551">That it has acted to deny any education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.300" offset="14276524">I would not void the fact, which you find stated in the brief that I have filed, that this has been a tremendous problem for the people of Prince Edward County and it will be a tremendous problem for the people of all southern communities, and particularly, in Sunnyside, Virginia for an indefinite period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.858" offset="14394807">There's no way in the world that you can take a community upon which white and colored people have lived upon the land, in many instances, have given homes and parcels of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.395" offset="14468995">There's no way in the world that you can arrange to admit those people to public schools except to commit them on -- admit them on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.515" offset="14529390">And that means that when you bring them into the public school system, in that arrangement, in that county that you have got what the lower court says, 1,800 colored children and you've got approximate of 1,500 white children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.111" offset="14583829">And while it's good --</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.479" offset="14645269">That's the first point, that it's not possible to have what you have in the urban communities where colored people and white people live in separate districts and they have de facto segregation, and where they have it in great many other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.646" offset="14717994">What I'm saying is that this problem and the impact of this problem in a rural community such as Prince Edward County, is not comparable with anything that goes on in any urban community.</text>

            <text syncTime="5751.466" offset="23109256">The Solicitor General asked you not to enjoin tuition grants on the basis of the liberty involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.253" offset="23164426">He asked you to enjoin the tuition grants on a conditional basis until public schools are open.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.271" offset="23204446">I think if the Court feels compelled to do anything in this case, that is far and away the desirable -- the more desirable thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.619" offset="23241853">Because the issue, the actual issue, and this is a tremendously important question, this matter of how, what does it reach of the privilege of the parents and of citizens to select their associations in education and to have a freedom to bring up their children as a will involved the most intimate and the most sacred natural rights of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.243" offset="23352299">And I do not think and I hope that this Court will not enter an order that will so restrict the freedom that I know that you gentlemen are dedicated to preserve -- preservation of perhaps and more conscious of perhaps than almost anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.638" offset="23433906">And that whatever you do with this case, that you will not take Brown against Board of Education which was in truth an enlargement of the liberty of mankind, and use it as a means to exercise compulsion and force against people.</text>

            <text syncTime="6300.727" offset="25306258">And we have stated that the amended supplemental complaint asks relief in the nature of the enjoining of the enforcement operation and execution of a state statute which relief under the laws of the United States cannot be granted except by District Court of three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.945" offset="25375117">The District Court in its opinion set out on page 160 of the record detailed all of these points which we made, set them for consideration when the trial was heard on the merits at a later date and these points were argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="6330.835" offset="25426735">That was the last we have ever heard of these contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.962" offset="25443244">I make this statement with more than passing justification where I refer to the language of the Fourth Circuit set out on page five of my brief, in which the majority pointed out this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.408" offset="25485040">For the District Court to get to the merits, it had to bypass a number of preliminary questions, including a very troublesome question arising under the Eleventh Amendment, all of which are brought up before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.670" offset="25542092">Now we have no doubt whatever that if the Fourth Circuit had not decided to abstain until the Virginia Supreme Court had considered what precisely was the nature of the Virginia system and this case had gone back to them from that decision that we would have had all of these contentions considered by the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.365" offset="25620877">But we take the position, that Due Process of law no matter how it maybe construed assuming it applies to the respondents in this case as it does to the petitioners which of course it does, necessarily requires that these contentions which we have made be considered at some time by some judicial tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6397.693" offset="25694124">We suggest in view of the action what this Court has taken that they must now be considered by this judicial tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.768" offset="25722441">So far as the Eleventh Amendment question is concerned, we have set out in our brief a number of cases, none of which the Solicitor General has dared to mention in which we have pointed out that the line of demarcation between a suit which seeks to enjoin a state official from taking action under an unconstitutional statute, that is a suit which seeks a cessation of action by state officials as contrasted to a suit which affirmatively seeks to require state officials to perform a duty alleged to be place upon them by the law is the line of demarcation between suits which are not forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment and suits which clearly fall within the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.103" offset="25911777">Now in the case at bar, the amended supplemental complaint alleged that the state officials whom I represent had failed to discharge the obligation placed upon them by the Virginia Constitution to maintain a system of free public schools throughout the state and it asked a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the state officials to operate public schools in Prince Edward County.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.818" offset="26014595">Now they did not ask for the peremptory writ of mandamus in so much -- in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.276" offset="26032462">They asked for an injunction to enjoin the state officials from refusing to operate the schools in Prince Edward County.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.936" offset="26063078">Now this sort of strategy has been laid to rest in the case of Louisiana versus Jumel which we cite, in which the Court has said that suits of this nature, a suit to mandamus a public official to perform an act or a suit to restrain a state official from refusing to perform an act under a state statute raise identical questions and constitutes a suit against the State within the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.914" offset="26171016">If we may paraphrase the language of this Court in Hagood versus Southern, a suit requesting the relief which is here requested by the petitioners, that is that state officials spend money which they do not have, which has not been appropriated, and affirmatively begin to operate the public schools in Prince Edward County.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.024" offset="26247502">If a suit requesting this relief be not a suit within the inhibition of the Eleventh Amendment, it would be difficult to conceive the frame of one which would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6546.502" offset="26289403">As the Court said in Hagood versus Southern, a judgment against state officials in their official and representative capacity commanding them to perform official functions on behalf of the state according to the dictates and decrease of the Court is, if anything can be, a judicial proceeding against the State itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="7083.476" offset="28437295">They say that they have a right to be provided with public schools in Prince Edward County.</text>
            <text syncTime="7088.780" offset="28458506">This is what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="7090.963" offset="28467179">Now Brown said and we admit this, that they have a right to racially nondiscriminatory access to such public schools as operated in the county, but that there is no provision in the Federal Constitution which requires the State to operate any public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="7111.083" offset="28547741">Second, we say, that this Court has never held that any truly local option law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and this is a point which I feel I must stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7124.856" offset="28602807">No decision of which I am aware and no decision contained in the brief of the Solicitor General holds that a local option law is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.660" offset="28650036">There is no such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7138.604" offset="28657768">Now in Virginia, we have a truly local option system. Our State Supreme Court has made that perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="7144.864" offset="28682846">Whether or not, public schools will be operated and locality is a decision which is made by each individual locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="7151.924" offset="28711058">It has been this way since the foundation of our public school systems were laid in 1869.</text>
            <text syncTime="7159.150" offset="28740002">It was that way when Virginia was readmitted to the Union, that principle was carried on in the Constitution of 1902 and it exists today.</text>

            <text syncTime="7193.919" offset="28879078">What I'm saying is this, that you cannot say that the Virginia local option laws which had existed for 100 years, constituted an invasive scheme to circumvent any orders of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7208.283" offset="28936547">That's what I want to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="7209.711" offset="28942190">Now on the local option proposition, I do say that a local option law in which you have a statewide program in which state aid is made available to each and every locality of the State which elects to come under it, provided the locality meets certain minimum requirements, I say that that is constitutionally unassailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7232.862" offset="29034872">As the majority of the Fourth Circuit said, “Any such program is that which is engaged in by every state in the union which the Federal Government engages in, in which it lets the states wish to come up to the minimum requirements, participate, pays money to those states which elect to come under the program and doesn't pay money to those which do not elect to come under the program is constitutionally unassailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7255.783" offset="29126510">We will not see the Solicitor General stand before this Court and urge to it that the National Defense Education Program is unconstitutional, but it is a clear local option program which is available only to those cities and counties in the United State which elect to insert in their curriculum those provisions for advanced Mathematics, modern foreign language and Science for which alone the Federal Government is willing to make its money available.</text>
            <text syncTime="7284.135" offset="29239881">Now this is straight local option, and it is available to everyone who wishes to come under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="7290.922" offset="29267048">In Virginia, three of our cities have elected to come under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="7294.557" offset="29281573">Must the Federal Government discontinue aid to those simply because three other cities in Virginia have elected not to come under the program, and that is precisely what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7305.289" offset="29324518">Virginia for 100 years has had a local option program in which every locality in the state which elects to operate public schools and which appropriates funds therefore may have state aid.</text>
