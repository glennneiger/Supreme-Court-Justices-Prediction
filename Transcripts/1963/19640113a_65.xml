            <text syncTime="431.219" offset="1828237">And in our view, it has to be on the same basis and I think this is one thing, I think that all of the lower courts have agreed upon that this is tested by the ordinary standards of judicial adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.823" offset="1894693">It isn't simply a personal appraisal and that's -- as I adverted to a moment ago, that's the difference with -- between state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.755" offset="1934399">But that is the kind of a commission that almost all of these state laws where there is the dual first board of commission or board of appraiser or board of view and then a right to an entirely new judicial adjudication on a jury trial de novo.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.751" offset="2210356">They can use their matter of judgment within the range of the evidence in their record, and that's the function which our view has.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.289" offset="2244524">But as Jerome Frank put it in one case where they were saying that evaluation is just a guess, but he says the guess must have the rational foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.415" offset="2293008">It can't just be a figure out of the air or it can't, as in this case of ours where we have a formula used by one of the witnesses Mr. Wilcox, it can't be a formula that is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.235" offset="2344312">Now here, we had the landowners who -- these clearance easements are imposed at varying heights over various tracts of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.892" offset="2382973">One of them is from 105 feet up to 165 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.629" offset="2401886">It's quite high in the air over this farm.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.786" offset="2422471">Yet, the landowners all in each instance came in and said -- each said, “My land is depreciated in value of 50% by impositions of those easements.”</text>
            <text syncTime="589.673" offset="2462072">Now, I think, if the commission had said, “We agree with the landowners that each of them is depreciated 50% even though it's 100 feet above Mr. Smith's property and it's only 13 feet above Mr. Merz's property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="605.579" offset="2525706">I think that would be an irrational decision which would appear from the report when the commission tells us what basis they used to arrive at their result.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.131" offset="2571891">And that is the obligation we say for example, within reason and of course I'm not saying they have to go into all of minutia of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.474" offset="2609298">But, within reason we had comparable sales here that were relied upon by both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.695" offset="2634167">We had some.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.323" offset="2640645">They had a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.060" offset="2643571">We had much more as we usually do, one of them was a sale of property right next door to the Merz's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.490" offset="2673351">We think there should be some indication whether the Commission gave weight to comparable sales and if so, just what sales they did and didn't consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.563" offset="5109635">But, an error and particularly in condemnation, case after case we have where the reversal in a jury trial is because an element of value was allowed to be brought in which shouldn't have been a claim of value -- a contention of value which should've been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.472" offset="5185285">And, presumptively, we -- no one knows unless we ask the jury whether it affected their result or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2012.229" offset="8152273">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.454" offset="8161155">I'm at a decided disadvantage as a country lawyer who's concerned with these people in this particular case and so far, the discussion has had to do with the broader picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.637" offset="8221968">I think it -- this case, of course, will be decided according to the rule the way it is now and I find it helpful to review the general principles just very briefly that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.354" offset="8280795">Our mission in this case is to decide the just compensation to these particular people for the clearance easements that were taken on their property eight years ago and which have been in litigation ever since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.938" offset="8351117">There's no dispute that we arrived at that just compensation by taking the fair cash market value which is what a man who wanted to buy this property would pay the landowner if he wanted to sell and which is, let's face it, is an informed estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.498" offset="8441396">We accrued ourselves to some degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.310" offset="8448606">It's just our best guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.266" offset="8460413">That's what we're trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.328" offset="8472639">Now, the rule say 71A (h) says that this Court authorizes the appointment of one of these commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.060" offset="8515584">The rule say that that commission will try the facts will arrive at a judgment as to the amount of what they find and that the appellate court will -- and that the district court will approve that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.160" offset="8603982">If there are no objections to that report, if that report is clear -- not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.446" offset="8637106">So, it seems to me that logically we're at the point in this case where we determine whether the facts as found by this commission and the law as found by this commission are clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.738" offset="8698337">Now, another thing your rule says, your rule says that if an objection is made to this report that the Government must object and tell the court of what the objection is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.854" offset="8774823">In this case, the objection to the Government as to the report which originally was a report that just found there was so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.057" offset="8823620">In this report, these commissioners which were composed of two lawyers and one real-estate man found that they had tried this case, that they had viewed the land and they had arrived at just compensation in these following specific amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.840" offset="8910764">The Government object to that report and said there's no specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.135" offset="8939917">So, the commission filed another report and in this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.825" offset="8958621">To me, they -- they tell this Court precisely what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.577" offset="8981713">They said the highest and best use of this property was for agriculture purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.190" offset="9160182">They gave -- they said, “Now, we're going to do it on the basis of the difference in the fair case market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.313" offset="9184632">We aren't going to pay any attention to any airplane activity above the ceilings which are placed on this line.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.161" offset="9220054">They said, “We did not feel that there was any sufficient proof of any use as to the sand on two of the tracts involved in here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.676" offset="9274075">Now, the Government now, at this time, says this in their briefs in this Court, they say, “We want the Court to say what was the market value of the land before the taking.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.586" offset="9345755">In their objections to the report, here's what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.160" offset="9380028">The reports wholly fail to make specific findings as to the facts on which the commission based its evaluation and failed to show how they applied applicable principles of law to the facts in reaching their ultimate conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.336" offset="9448678">The reports wholly fail to show that all comp -- incompetent and inadmissible testimony was disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.559" offset="9481592">The reports wholly fail to show how controverted testimony was resolved, if it were, in arriving at evaluations and are, therefore, deficient and inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.182" offset="9528090">The reports taken as a whole amount to no more than a general verdict of a jury since no specific findings of any controverted issues were made, the only specific findings being as to those matters which were stipulated to by the parties to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.019" offset="9595486">Therefore, the reports are wholly inadequate to furnish an adequate basis for you by the trial judge or an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.614" offset="9641880">Now, our contention is that the Government is inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.580" offset="9657657">The Government in the report that the commissioners make says, “You gentlemen should be specific and explain your arithmetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.096" offset="9711783">You should explain your philosophy as you reach this result.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.805" offset="9738637">On the other hand, when it comes to objecting to the report, they say just a broad objection is sufficient and, to me, that's inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.429" offset="9789106">The notion of a commission, and incidentally the Government has always objected to the enactment of this rule, the notion of a commission is in people like my clients who live 100 miles away from where the district court sets whose land is there, that this commission can come out and look at the land and get a better notion of it and thereby expedite the payment of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.698" offset="9914180">Now, in this particularly case, the fact has been just to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.953" offset="9939153">We have people with a total award of $27,183 who'd been in litigation for eight years when their property was taken in March of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.722" offset="9978232">If -- if the notion of the rule is to expedite, then the Government at the time it accepts to the reports should say, “Fellows, why didn't you say the before and after market value?</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.208" offset="10052211">Why didn't you say these other specifics that they now ask for the first time that go in this report?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.080" offset="10091708">If they had have asked for those things, the commission would've supplied them and that would all be all there was to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.067" offset="10123682">Now in the matter of the report itself and as Justice Goldberg was approaching the problem a minute ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.601" offset="10177808">Here's the picture I give.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.327" offset="10360665">I'm a commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.763" offset="10360560">I try this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.305" offset="10360456">The landowners testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.100" offset="10360351">In this case, the landowners somehow made a limit of their 50 years and just because they're party to the suit doesn't make them lawyers, it doesn't make them completely incompetent, but you do take what they have to say with a grain of salt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.799" offset="10360247">The landowners testify, Mr. Wilcox testifies, the Government has an expert to the Kansas City of Missouri who lives 500 or 600 miles from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.533" offset="10360142">He testifies, a very expensive expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.241" offset="10360038">The Government has another expert testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.857" offset="10359933">You have these various experts testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.788" offset="10370487">I hear this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.871" offset="10378846">And then, I get out and I look at this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.215" offset="10404237">I look at the property that is involved in comparable sales and I take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.010" offset="10447391">And then, of my own -- I make a decision as to this value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.042" offset="10483545">Maybe this landowner, I say he's -- I'll take what he says with a grain of salt or he didn't have the right notions about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.187" offset="10520116">I will -- I'll pay 10% to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.807" offset="10530565">I'll pay 50% to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.099" offset="10539760">I'll pay 30% to the fact I viewed the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.574" offset="10553657">I'll do all these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.434" offset="10565151">Well, surely, it's not necessary for the commission to give weight to these various things that entered into their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.353" offset="10616769">In this case, the District Court felt that there was sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable him to review the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.076" offset="10671626">Judge Phillips and Judge Picket and Judge Lewis in the Circuit Court of Appeals examined these findings of fact and conclusions of law and they felt that there were sufficient things that would make it possible for them to review these findings as to the amount of this compensation and not have any feeling that the commission grabbed the value out of the sky or anything of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.490" offset="10793357">It is admitted by the Government that all of these values are well -- there is no contention that these values are excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.293" offset="10824495">All of these values are well within the range of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.978" offset="10851244">It's also when you read this very dull looking and very tiresome record which is an imposition on you gentlemen, you find that there is various little references in the Government brief that things that the commission did that was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.246" offset="10924387">For instance, they said they took the testimony of the authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.979" offset="10939329">You find in this record when you read it that, at pages 74 and 118, there's only two references of authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.334" offset="10976737">One of them, the Government -- the only thing involving authors was -- thank you, sir.</text>
