            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Nathan Jackson, Petitioner, versus Wilfred Denno.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.380" offset="128920">Mr. Collins, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_g_collins" startTime="10.808" stopTime="309.970">
            <label>Mr. Daniel G. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="10.808" offset="146578">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.719" offset="162252">Just before the Court recessed yesterday, I asserted that the New York procedure for determining voluntariness of a confession, which lets the jury have this question unless the defendant can meet the very heavy burden for showing that anything but a finding of involuntariness would be unreasonable, imposes a very, very heavy burden on a defendant and in New York, makes the protection against coerced confessions largely an illusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.198" offset="260159">I do not assert this merely as a theoretical argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.246" offset="272384">I think it is a prevalent notion in the New York Criminal Bar that all confessions will go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.477" offset="297253">Moreover, it seems to be no accident that a great deal of this Court's litigation on con -- coerced confessions has through the years come from the New York jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.170" offset="340093">In appraising the New York procedure, it is, as I said yesterday, important to recognize that there is no legitimate relationship between constitutional protection and degree of constitutional violation that this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.428" offset="397040">And that the New York procedure applies in the face of this conclusion is apparent from the rationale of the rule that coerced confessions, once admitted, vitiate a state conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.385" offset="436955">We note today, after this Court's opinions in Rogers against Richmond, Spano against New York and Mapp against Ohio, that the basis for this rule is the fact that our system of constitutional justice will not tolerate the impermissible method used to obtain such confessions, in essence that they are used -- taints the entire proceeding and requires its complete nullification.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.316" offset="524622">Only if the rationale of the coerced confession rule or the unreliability of such confession might there be some justification for finding a positive relationship between constitutional violation and the degree of constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.950" offset="583137">On this point, I think it is useful to recall that in Stein against New York, Mr. Justice Jackson, speaking for this Court, indicated that he believed, erroneously we now know, the unreliability of the confession was the basis for the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.228" offset="648234">Petitioner also asked this Court to take cognizance of the fact that the New York procedure compels a defendant on penalty of losing his constitutional protection against the use of an involuntary confession to take the witne -- the witness stand in a state criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.762" offset="706435">As a practical matter, a defendant cannot afford to let a confession go unanswered. He must take the stand to refute or explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.696" offset="738200">This is just what happened in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.460" offset="749171">Petitioner took the stand to deny any memory of the interrogation by the Assistant District Attorney to claim that in any event, there was duress present and to deny among other allegations in the confession that he had admitted firing the first shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.895" offset="834957">The question of state compulsion, testimony of -- the state -- the question of -- of incrimination under state law is squarely before this Court again this term in the case of Malloy against Hogan, which has already been briefed and is awaiting argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.985" offset="911339">Should this Court find unconstitutionality there, that would indicate that there is another fatal deficiency in the New York procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.195" offset="952195">Respondent repeatedly asserts in his brief that petitioner's argument here against the New York procedure is essentially an anti-jury argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.827" offset="990647">This is most certainly not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.364" offset="1000782">In the first place, this Court, in a long series of -- of cases, has firmly established that a confession that is involuntary as a matter of law cannot go to the jury without vitiating a conviction regardless of the sufficiency of the other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.240" offset="1056371">Respondent in -- at page 15 of his brief, himself, admits this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.156" offset="1076015">Petitioner is only asking that this well-established rule be applied consistently and rationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.004" offset="1103391">Secondly, the procedure in which judge and not jury makes the factual determination of voluntariness is the traditional common-law procedure, the so-called "orthodox" rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.207" offset="1144247">Professor Wigmore, no great friend of exclusionary rules generally, nevertheless, was outraged from the viewpoint of the law of evidence by the New York procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.301" offset="1180609">He simply could not understand how a jury could administer exclusionary rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.828" offset="1198686">Petitioner here certainly cannot be accused of making -- of advancing a position that tampers with the traditional rights of juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.649" offset="1237974">Petitioner hopes that it is abundantly clear, both in his brief and in this oral argument, that the rule -- that involuntary confession vitiate a state conviction is based on their abhorrence under our constitutional system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.349" offset="1308818">Unfortunately, the New York procedure does not serve the ends that a constitutional procedure must serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.072" offset="1967626">He -- when he had alighted from the taxicab in the vicinity of the Cumberland Hospital after the shooting shortly after 1 a.m., he was approached by a policeman with a drawn gun and then taken into custody and taken to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.329" offset="2024678">With the Court's permission, I would like to turn to petitioner's second argument that is that his confession to the Assistant District Attorney was involuntary as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.155" offset="2075982">I think it is fair to say that the courts below took an extremely narrow and pseudo-technical view of the facts of coercion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.870" offset="2110882">There is no dispute that at the time he confessed, petitioner was desperately ill nor is there any disputes -- dispute that a confession would be involuntary when taken while a defendant were under the influence of the drugs that were actually administered to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.179" offset="2172113">The answer of -- of the court below to all of this, and I think it is a very, very inadequate answer, is that there was no problem, and I am quoting "because the undisputed proof was that any effect of a demerol would not have commenced until at least 10 minutes after the confession had been concluded".</text>
            <text syncTime="534.370" offset="2240867">In the first place, petitioner submits that this is not what the proof showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.521" offset="2257481">It showed in the only medial testimony that the -- that demerol reaction is an individual matter and that any statements about its time effectiveness can speak only in terms of averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.014" offset="2299382">Averages is not my term, although I am very glad adopt it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.645" offset="2317981">Speaking in a memorandum of law in the district -- to the District Court, respondent said, and I quote, "The medical testimony was to the effect that in the average case, demerol does not begin to operate upon the patient for 15 minutes."</text>
            <text syncTime="568.660" offset="2378062">Moreover, for the purpose of safeguarding this petitioner's rights and the rights of other -- of -- of criminal defendant similarly situated, petitioner asked this Court to hold that whenever a confession follows close upon the administration of drug and memory -- the administration of will and memory depri -- depriving drugs, the confession should be regarded as presumptively involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.029" offset="2475447">And that presumption should not be subject to rebuttal merely by showing -- by general medical testimony, some time effectiveness of normal drug reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.526" offset="2517452">Any other rule petitioner submits is fraught with the greatest danger and imposes an unfair burden on -- on a criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.667" offset="2550053">How I think is it fair to ask, can a criminal defendant mount the necessary technical attack on a drug induced confession when there is a real danger that he cannot even remember the confession because one of the properties of the drug that was administered is to create amnesia?</text>
            <text syncTime="629.513" offset="2621419">The very least that the prosecution should be required to do in such cases, and it certainly did not do it in this case, is to prove that a criminal defendant under such circumstances had the benefit of advice of counsel when he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.903" offset="2675022">And I think that bringing in the question of counsel on this point follows naturally from this Court's many opinions on coerced confessions in which it has said that a criminal defendant who, under the circumstances, did not have the necessary -- ordinarily would not have had the necessary capability of making a voluntary confession should have had some independent advisor-counsel at the time he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.987" offset="2775333">Such cases as Gallegos against Colorado, Haley against Ohio, Fikes against Alabama, Culombe against Connecticut, all considered the point of the necessity for independent advice when a defendant makes a confession under circumstances that indicate that in all probability, he did not have the requisite mental capacity alone to confess at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.678" offset="2874075">Petitioner's third argument here goes to the question of the necessity for a hearing in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.330" offset="2904691">Denying petitioner a hearing, the courts below, both the District Court and the Court of Appeal -- Court of Appeals relied heavily on Brown against Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.690" offset="2942098">This Court has since rendered its opinion in Townsend v. Sain, which found that the Brown -- Brown case was an inadequate guide for determining when a District Court hearing must be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.329" offset="2988701">At the very least, Townsend requires a reappraisal of the decisions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.164" offset="3008031">More importantly, Townsend also offers specific guidance for this case, since the actual basis for the decision here, that material facts concerning the properties of the drugs scopolamine and demerol were not developed at the state hearing is very much in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.337" offset="3068740">In fact, this case presents an even more compelling need for a hearing than existed in the Townsend case.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.517" offset="3093400">Here, the jury was told merely that scopolamine, and I'm quoting, "dried up secretions".</text>
            <text syncTime="753.499" offset="3117328">The jury was not giving the -- given the faintest inkling that scopolamine is notorious as a drug capable of breaking down will and memory or that it intensifies all of the effects of demerol including the amnesic effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.903" offset="3171035">Nor were there are any -- any facts developed in the state hearing at all concerning the time which it takes scopolamine to be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.387" offset="3204890">As to demerol, as I have said previously, a reading of the attending physician's testimony in the state court, indicates that he made no categorical statements about time effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.577" offset="3249716">A reading of the Standard Medical Authority does not bear out the normal time effectiveness periods that he referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.201" offset="3280227">Moreover, the trial record is devoid of any reference to the manner in which demerol was administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.411" offset="3301021">If it were administered intravenously, the drug would have been effective immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.533" offset="6897455">My learned and respected friend has made a statement that there is some significance in the fact that a great volume of a litigation coming from -- involving coerced confessions comes from New York to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.063" offset="6983659">Now, within the last 20 years, approximately, this Court, to the best of my recollection, has considered only four such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.355" offset="7028799">The first was the Malinski case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.872" offset="7042905">And I have a very definite recollection of that because I retried Malinski after this Court reversed the judgment on the ground of a coerced confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.295" offset="7112600">Well, we couldn't use the confession, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.698" offset="7122213">And the state's principal witness on the first trial who was a very degraded character, a -- a convict, I forget his name, who was Malinski's brother-in-law, and who had implicated him outside of the confession recanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.998" offset="7199326">So we didn't have the confession, we didn't have this witness, and the jury naturally acquitted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.921" offset="7227016">The second case was the Leyra case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.817" offset="7238614">And I have an even more pertinent and personal recollection of that because I argued the case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.051" offset="7267558">And there too, the Court reversed the judgment because of a coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.937" offset="7295143">And perhaps to anticipate a question, we retried Leyra, but we didn't have the confession in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.760" offset="7326386">The jury convicted him anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.572" offset="7337671">This made three juries which had found him guilty but our Court of Appeals reversed and dismissed the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.219" offset="7368286">The third case was the -- the Stein case to which I will refer more at length later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.182" offset="7400051">And the fourth case was the Spano case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.470" offset="7413217">In Stein, the Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.552" offset="7421576">In Spano, the Court reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.767" offset="7530454">So that there is not this preponderance of litigation from New York to which my friend has referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.082" offset="7571728">He makes this statistical claim or I should say, perhaps, it has a statistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.535" offset="7597537">Our record in this Court is not very impressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.442" offset="7613106">And from New York, there are three reversals and one affirmance, but I don't cite these facts as a statistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.123" offset="7643826">I cite them because of their pertinence and relevance to the first argument which Professor Collins makes to wit that not only is the New York procedure in testing out the voluntariness of confession, unkind to defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.228" offset="7720312">It is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.843" offset="7730761">Now, in Malinski and in Leyra and in Spano, no point was raised about the constitutionality of the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.163" offset="7779976">But in Stein, it very definitely was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.815" offset="7794604">And Mr. Justice Jackson wrote at length on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.185" offset="7820100">And Your Honors will find quotations from his opinion, which I, of course, admire very much, scattered throughout my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.134" offset="7867956">And counsel has just conceded here in argument that the Court found in -- in Stein, found in New York procedure to be a proper one, unobjectionable from any point of view -- of view, and he has reduced to the necessity of asking this Court in effect to reverse on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.256" offset="7968371">It is, I think, noteworthy that he doesn't cite a single judicial authority for that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.167" offset="7996061">And that he has constrained to cite only the writings of text writers and of learned professors of the law, whose authority to speak generally, I -- I, of course, do not attack, but whose practical experience in the field is open to question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.060" offset="8175574">I've tried cases for many years before I began to argue on the questions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.048" offset="8203577">I've seen jury's concern with -- with confession cases who have acquitted defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.913" offset="8235029">I can't give you a statistic on that either, but I think it is fair to sum up Professor Collin's position and the position of those legal scholars in whom we he finds his support in his conflict, that it is based on a deep pervasive and underlying fear and disbelief and distrust of the jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.675" offset="8342026">Now, this Court had occasion to write in Leland against Oregon, in addition to Stein against New York, where the specific question of confession was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.918" offset="8391032">This Court had occasioned to write not too long ago in 344 U.S. Juries have for centuries made the basic decision between guilt and innocence and between criminal responsibility and legal insanity upon the basis of the facts as revealed by all the evidence and the law, as explained by instructions detailing the legal distinctions, placement and weight of the burden of proof, the effect of presumptions, the meaning of intent, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.491" offset="8521331">We think to condemn the operation of this system here would be to condemn the system generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.355" offset="8548812">We are not prepared to do so, and it is our answer almost in some to the contention on the first point that nothing has been shown in this case to cause this Court to change its opinion expressed in the Leland case, in the Culombe case, in Rogers against Richmond and Stein against New York that the jury system of trying out the voluntariness of a confession is both proper and workable and constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.749" offset="8682350">That it -- that the system operated to the detriment of this defendant in the final verdict and judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.937" offset="8727071">So, of course, no argument at all because there was a plentitude of -- of evidence in this case of guilt outside of the confessions, and I will have to refer to that in brief in a moment or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.431" offset="8785063">But to summarize our position, there is no warrant either in the decisions of this Court or in the Constitution itself to compel this Court to say that a particular method of trying a question of fact is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.759" offset="8866356">My friend speaks of the Stein decision as the Stein aberration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.802" offset="8890598">Now, I think he is not -- he is not really referring to this aspect of the Stein case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.547" offset="8925602">And that which caused the dissent in Stein was the intimation, although I don't find that it was a holding that if there was other and sufficient credible evidence of guilt, the fact that an involuntary confession had been admitted would not void the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.963" offset="8999267">Well, this Court has made it clear in Spano and other cases that that is not the law, and that is not the point that's involved here in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.131" offset="11947865">It's fairly clearly that the policeman shot the defendant first, which, of course, raises no legal question in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.092" offset="12055698">He forced him to take him to the Cumberland Street Hospital, which is a city hospital in downtown Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.569" offset="12081612">The taxi driver had presence of mind enough to say to the defendant, "I can't take you in all by myself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.388" offset="12164890">The detectives of the precinct were notified and very quickly, thereafter, one of the detectives came and he got a statement which certainly implicated the defendant in the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.998" offset="12259349">About almost two hours later, well, I should say this, the police then notified our office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.747" offset="12286412">We have a system whereby whenever a felony is committed in the county, in the borough of Brooklyn, we are notified, and somebody from our office goes with a stenographer and interviews witnesses and interviews the defendant, if he's been apprehended and tries to get a statement or a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.505" offset="12381393">It was about two hours later that our man came with a stenographer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.004" offset="12403440">And it is one of the coincidences which happened, which give warrant to the phrase that more -- truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, but just as this defendant was about to be taken upstairs to the operating room and just as he was given this injection of combined scopolamine and demerol, our man came, took the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.552" offset="12513573">The evidence shows that the statement was 5 minutes in duration and then our man left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.971" offset="12551293">Now, the testimony as to his physical condition, there was nothing in the record, nothing whatsoever to show that he was unable to try to give this statement, the trial of some statement about his being refused water unless he continued to give the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.769" offset="12642408">We showed quite satisfactorily that he was refused water at the instance of the hospital attendants because that's proper preoperative treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4045.524" offset="16285445">He was assigned to this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.018" offset="16291401">Your Honors will read the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.555" offset="16301641">I think you will perceive that he did for his client everything that anybody could do for a client in the situation and precarious predicament in which this defendant found himself on the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.266" offset="16360469">So far as I pointed out, we had eyewitnesses that the defendant stood over the policeman and said, "Don't be a hero.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.283" offset="16392547">Don't be a hero."</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.356" offset="16396831">And finally shot him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.103" offset="16403832">Now, what was Judge Healy to do in a case like this?</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.231" offset="16420342">Was he to exercise his forensic ability and he had it in great degree, he had a voice that sounded like the overtones of a cathedral organ.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.379" offset="16464854">And try to get this man acquitted in the face of the overwhelming evidence, one, of premeditated murder and two, that it -- it was a homicide committed at the very moment of the completion of the robbery?</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.038" offset="16527548">Well, no lawyer worthy of resolved would do that anymore than a general would send a platoon against a division.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.968" offset="16563284">All Mr. Healy had opened to him, and all he tried to do was to persuade the jury not to convict his defendant, his client, a murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.314" offset="16616678">And the summation is replete with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.178" offset="16640084">He uses the word I don't quite understand the -- the relevance of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.863" offset="16654817">He says, "It would be -- it would be affectatious for me to ask you to acquit the defendant completely."</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.327" offset="16684701">And his whole summation was devoted to an attempt to show that there was no premeditation and that the felony had long been completed and therefore, this was not a true felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.319" offset="16740603">Now, to say to my friend, it's too gentlemanly to say it, but I think it's implied in his argument even though he rejects the suggestion in his own presentation to say a lot to imply that Judge Healy's choice of tactics, and I use the word "advisedly", and I don't there is anything offensive about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.599" offset="16837778">That to say or to imply that Judge Healy's choice of trial tactics rendered the representation that bad, as to make a mockery of justice in this case, is I think to misconceive the nature of the state and federal cases on that subject and to misconceive the -- the tenor of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.352" offset="16940805">Now, let me concede that the issue was not fully explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.903" offset="16971003">It wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.918" offset="16979048">I take it that Judge Healy had been so minded he could have asked for a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.947" offset="17003186">And he could have brought in an expert witness or witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.156" offset="17020008">And the expert could have testified in response to a hypothetical question involving all the evidence in the case and maybe, the expert would have said, under these circumstances, the man could not have been in full possession of his mental faculties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.347" offset="17096808">I think Judge Healy had the right to say whether from the overall point of view of the ultimate interest of his client, he wanted to confuse the issue in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.202" offset="17148217">And he also had the right to say out of his experience and out of his ability that he didn't have a ghost of a chance to win this case on that kind of an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.441" offset="17201089">Because from practical experience I think juries demonstrably always pay more attention to a witness who was present and who can testify and who did testify, the man was alright than they will to a paid expert who come in and on the basis of a hypothetical question pontificate that this was or was not so when he wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.070" offset="17303698">And this whole issue was as simple as all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.688" offset="17314147">And this, by the way, is what's going to happen if this Court shouldn't reverse the court below and -- and return the matter to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.200" offset="17356152">I can't conceive that this Court will reverse the judgment because there's nothing in the record to warrant anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.862" offset="17390843">The outside limit of what this Court could or -- and I don't say should, could do, it seems to me, is to return it to the District Court for a hearing on the issue of the physic -- not the properties of demerol but the -- the effect of the demerol administered here on this defendant within the 5 minutes that it took to take the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.498" offset="17493347">Now, what would the District Court have?</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.495" offset="17505364">It wouldn't have a single thing beyond -- before it that it didn't already know because everybody knows that drugs given to reduce pain, and that's what demerol is for, drugs given to reduce pain have, an effect on the nervous system and on the mind in general and the District Court would have no more than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.473" offset="17605256">We get hold of the same doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.946" offset="17615182">We get hold of the same nurse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.336" offset="17628766">We can get a hold of everybody who is in that room when our assistant took the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.381" offset="17648933">And those people would testify and testify truthfully to the same effect as they testified to on the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.543" offset="17677563">And then they would be paraded before the District Court, a possession of one or more experts, who would testify that in certain cases, demerol causes a man to lose control of his mental faculties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.907" offset="17739003">They couldn't say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.287" offset="17748511">They couldn't say positively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.699" offset="17758124">They couldn't even approximate the certainty which our eye and ear witnesses would have that in this case, it has that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.469" offset="17793233">Now, what could the District Court properly do except to find after a hearing exactly what it found before a review.</text>

            <text syncTime="4521.618" offset="18189876">Its main action is to relieve pain, to deaden pain and somewhere in here, scopolamine, apparently isn't in question, not only dries up secretions, but somewhere in here, the word it makes them drowsy or the phrase as used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.944" offset="18263124">And then on redirect examination or on cross-examination, Judge Healy asked, "Wouldn't it take effect in a shorter time, perhaps on one person than it might on another?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.542" offset="18333550">The doctor said, "In children, for example, the same dose might have a faster effect."</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.894" offset="18354970">Then the Court said, "Judge Healy asked you, doesn't the physical condition of the patient to whom you inject have an effect on how long before it takes effect?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.533" offset="18397497">And the witness said, "Oh, no."</text>

            <text syncTime="4604.933" offset="18523094">Then he goes on to say, "Well, 15 minutes is usually the time of action after you inject it."</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.787" offset="18546500">He says it operates individually, the sum and substance Your Honor is that our witness, it was not contradicted except in the form of questions which, of course, wasn't evidenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.343" offset="18604701">Our witness in substance said that the fact that this man had lost a pint of blood that he had been shot through the liver, I thought it was the lung, had made any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.449" offset="18653184">He was still in full possession of his faculties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.036" offset="18663528">And that's exactly what this witness will say, I'm sure, if there's a hearing order.</text>

            <text syncTime="4669.694" offset="18782124">But I can't tell you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5114.984" offset="20563257">The opinion by Mr. Justice Jackson, on page 172 of 346 U.S., speaks of the -- discusses the question of whether the jury should be present -- must be present when the judge makes a determination of voluntariness or involuntariness as a matter of law under the New York procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.976" offset="20647267">Now, I'm quoting from the bottom of that page, "The judge is not required to exclude the jury while he hears evidence as to voluntariness," citing People against Brasch, "and perhaps is not permitted to do so", not permitted to exclude the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.813" offset="20702647">Now, I've read the Randazzio case and I don't think that that case would be a bar to the judge's -- frankly to the -- would be a bar to the judge's decision to exclude the jury as a matter of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.645" offset="20749981">Yet, I do think it's a matter of discretion very clearly under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.060" offset="20783626">As to the amendment of the remittitur of the New York Court of Appeals to which Mr. Siegel has referred, all that says is that the Court of Appeals held there was no violation of any constitutional right of said defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.493" offset="20833364">I assumed that the Court simply means that it was applying what we have referred to here as the Stein rule, that they simply had found that there was no involuntary as a matter of law confession but have not gone into the facts except to the extent of seeing whether there's sufficient other evidence in the record to sustain a conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5773.272" offset="23196505">He cited four cases, I had add Fay against Noia which had coerced confession as the basis for the problem in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5877.720" offset="23614255">I do think Mr. Siegel's argument presents the question in its most dramatic terms and that is the problem when drugs are administered, approving their effect on a particular petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.956" offset="23667231">When we are talking in terms of minutes, 5 minutes or 10 minutes or 2 minutes and we are talking about drugs that deprive -- deprive dependence of their -- not only ability to resist interrogation but ability even more importantly I think to remember interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.669" offset="23718013">I think we have such a dangerous situation that we'd be -- that certainly petitioner feels this Court should adopt the rule which would strike at that practice as a general matter.</text>
