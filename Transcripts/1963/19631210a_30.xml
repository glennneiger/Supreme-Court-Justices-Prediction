            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 30, Edward R. Fields et al., Appellants, versus City of Fairfield.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="35.679" offset="246053">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.602" offset="257755">This case is here on appeal to review determination of the Alabama Supreme Court, which affirmed a criminal conviction, a conviction for criminal contempt in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.770" offset="326405">Individual appellants, Lyons and Fields, were sentenced to five days in jail and were fined $50 apiece.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.837" offset="366738">The case raises two constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.237" offset="380322">One, whether the City of Fairfield may use the power of the injunction to suppress in advance the enjoinment of First Amendment rights in order to preserve its conception of the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.665" offset="438000">The case is a direct successor to the long line of cases which this Court has -- in which this Court has spelled out the crucial part played by freedom of speech in the development of political liberty in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.488" offset="493275">There is the second question relating to the Thompson v. Louisville point whether or not the record is so devoid of evidence that the conviction must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.173" offset="544057">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.397" offset="556910">The individual appellants are Officers of the National States Rights Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.963" offset="575195">The party which has appeared on the ballot in several states stands for white supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.671" offset="602049">Appellants announced that a meeting was to be held in Fairfield, Alabama on October 11, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.056" offset="631620">They distributed leaflets announcing a meeting which stated in effect that the purpose of the meeting was to advocate racial segregation in schools, recreation facilities and labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.605" offset="689821">The meeting was to be held not on the streets, not in the parks, it was to be held in a private hall and it was a public meeting to which the public was invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.311" offset="736632">The day before the meeting was to be held, the Mayor of Fairfield learned that the meeting has been announced and that handbills have been distributed announcing the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.305" offset="784593">He therefore sent a notice to appellant Fields telling him that he had violated two ordinances of the City of Fairfield, which together flatly prohibited the distribution of any leaflets, pamphlets, or any kind of literature at all on the streets or any other public way in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.587" offset="873723">And that by announcing that this meeting was to be held the next night, he had violated another city ordinance which require that before any public meeting be held, a permit be obtained from the Mayor of Fairfield and Fields has not made application for this permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.420" offset="961076">In the course of that day which was the day before the meeting was scheduled, appellant Fields and the Mayor had two phone calls which were inconclusive, but they came to some kind of agreement that Fields would go to the Mayor's office the next day at about 2 o'clock in order to discuss it further.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.812" offset="1034637">The next morning, however, the City of Fairfield went into Circuit Court with a bill of complaint and alleged that the appellants had called a public meeting for that evening, had announced the meeting by distributing handbills I quote, from the bill of complaint, "By distributing handbills of an inflammatory nature designed to create ill-will and disturbances between the races."</text>
            <text syncTime="259.624" offset="1141844">The complaint alleged that the handbills have been distributed in violation of the two city ordinance referred to and that no permit have been obtained for the meeting that has been announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.443" offset="1185102">The compliant also alleged that the purpose of the meeting was, "To create tension, ill-will, disturbances and disorderly conduct between the races", and that it is, "Calculated to create a disturbance, incite to riot, disturb the peace, and disrupt -- disrupt peace and good order in the City of Fairfield that would constitute a public nuisance injurious to the health, comfort, or welfare of the city and its inhabitants."</text>
            <text syncTime="295.188" offset="1284159">The Court issued the injunction forthwith ex parte, no notice to the appellants here, no notice of Fields or its alliance or to any officials of the National States Rights Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.370" offset="1348838">He issued a temporary restraining order which enjoined the appellants from holding their announced public meeting and from further distribution of handbills, "Such as were distributed Fairfield on October 10, 1961."</text>
            <text syncTime="324.421" offset="1401083">And the same order, he set down a hearing on the application for affirmative injunction for November 17, which was more than a month after the date of the meeting had originally been set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.020" offset="1463463">The appellants here Fields and -- Fields was served with the temporary restraining order on noon of the day that the meeting was supposed to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.535" offset="1501497">The meeting was supposed to be held at 8 p.m.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.854" offset="1986748">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.670" offset="2006079">The evidences which I'll just briefly review, was that Fields and Lyons had indeed gone to the place where the meeting was scheduled to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.022" offset="2043486">But they have done so in order to tell anybody who might have intended to attend that it had been transferred to the City Park in Lipscomb, Alabama which was a town not far away.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.215" offset="2084237">And Fields testified that he had gotten the permission of the Mayor of Lipscomb to hold the meeting in the city park.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.246" offset="2120391">And Fields testified that he had no intention whatever of violating the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.150" offset="2135960">But as I say had gone there merely to notify people that the meeting was transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.537" offset="2169501">He said there were about 10 to 12 people there and that he told all of them that the meeting was at -- at -- at Lipscomb that he didn't distribute any handbills, but he did distribute a few copies of the party newspaper Thunderbolt, the copies which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.305" offset="2228642">Everything that Fields said was corroborated by the city police who were the prosecution's witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.569" offset="2265631">One Officer Pope stated there wasn't any disturbance and the conditions were peaceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.365" offset="2280782">Another Officer Meisel who actually effected the arrest of Field and Lyons testified that, "There was no meeting held."</text>
            <text syncTime="552.281" offset="2312547">And that he saw no leaflets being distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.889" offset="2322892">The only thing he saw distributed was the Thunderbolt, the party newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.872" offset="2342849">The Chief Police didn't see any leaflets passed out other than the Thunderbolt.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.956" offset="2375241">So there -- it was not disputed that there wasn't any meeting, that there weren't any handbills passed out but nonetheless, the appellants were held in contempt violating the temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.643" offset="2441906">And the reasons given by the trial court he said -- well he said that there -- there was no evidence the pamphlet was distributed but he was impressed, "By the tone and context of the newspaper, the ones they distributed, and he thought that it was a -- an artifice on the part of someone to bring home to the fact that the meeting was going to be held."</text>
            <text syncTime="607.757" offset="2534379">He didn't say anything all about that whether or not the meeting was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.404" offset="2545037">He just ignored that.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.950" offset="2551202">He said the ordinances were legal exercise of police power in a municipality and he explained what -- and he said he also didn't think that there are collateral, he could challenge the constitutionality ordinances by collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.526" offset="2609507">He said very interestingly enough, he said, "It's the intention I know of the public officials both -- both of this county and of the various municipalities of this -- of the Bessemer division of this county", and we're going to everything we can, "To maintain the status quo."</text>
            <text syncTime="639.942" offset="2663111">He referred to a movement into one of our public parks several years ago but that was straightened out with a matter of a few weeks by the City Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.562" offset="2701667">On appeal before the Alabama Supreme Court, the convictions were affirmed and the Alabama Supreme Court held that there was evidence to support the findings that they violated the terms of the temporary injunction in -- in both respects and that it only spoke of one ordinance, in the singular, it said we cannot say it is unconstitutional on its face but doesn't say which ordinance it refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.164" offset="2815979">But its judgment in effect went off on the (Inaudible) ground that the order disobeyed was not void, and citing United States versus United Mine Workers held that one may not raise a question of unconstitutionality and collateral proceedings on appeal for a judgment of conviction for contempt of the order decreed or an application for habeas corpus for release from imprisonment before contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.662" offset="2910020">In other words, what he was saying was that, if you want to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinances and injunction, you have to do it on orderly appellate -- what -- it's -- what it said was the orderly appellate processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.244" offset="2968325">And that you could not flout the order of the Court and get a determination growing out of the contempt conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.328" offset="3012733">That I think is the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.882" offset="3046902">The question, therefore, is whether the appellant is pain right to exercise, enjoy the freedoms of speech and assembly which are guaranteed by the First Amendment can be suppressed by rule of law which forbids appellants from challenging unconstitutional grounds, and indisputably frivolous injunction based upon in this unarguably unconstitutional ordinances whether they can be -- whether --</text>
