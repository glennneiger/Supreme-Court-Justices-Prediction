            <text syncTime="32.328" offset="232678">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.534" offset="249501">Here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals from District of Columbia, this case presents the question whether an indigent convict confronted with the District Court finding that his appeal or would be appeal is not taken in good faith is entitled to a complete stenographic transcript to unable his court appointed counsel to search for hidden error.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.712" offset="362245">For us, it is both the beginning and the end of the argument that in the federal system, in the first place under rule 52 (b) hidden error is ground for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.120" offset="419819">And in the second place that a solvent defendant can provide his counsel a complete stenographic transcript to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.196" offset="468198">That brings denial of a complete transcript to an indigent squarely within Douglas against California, "Where the errors are hidden, the indigent has only the right to a meaningless ritual, while the rich man has a meaningful appeal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="114.734" offset="562343">The Governments says, “So what?”</text>
            <text syncTime="118.353" offset="576763">The gap is only a product of the indigent's poverty and Government is not required to equalize economic condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.475" offset="617305">But when the consequence of poverty is inability to defend a criminal conviction, overcoming the disability is not to equalize economic condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.024" offset="671431">It is to equalize the criminal justice under law.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.993" offset="691388">If Government is under no obligation to overcome the disabilities of poverty when it under takes a criminal prosecution or would borrow criminal appeal, why should it have to supply an indigent with counsel or with any record at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.005" offset="755440">Government is constitutionally required to do these things because in administering criminal justice, it must overcome disabilities resulting from poverty just as much as it practically can.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.344" offset="820746">In Norvell versus Illinois, this Court held that the State was not obliged to supply a transcript because through no fault of the State, the transcript was simply unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.536" offset="869543">The inescapable implication is that the transcript had been available.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.390" offset="888978">The State would have been compelled to supply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.677" offset="902040">What otherwise could we possibly mean when we claim to provide in our system equal justice under law for the rich and for the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.934" offset="947075">To deny a poor man the appellant review which is available to a convict with money is to mock the very idea of equality, nothing could be more damaging to democracy at home or abroad than the notion that to us, the majestic equality of which the law speaks means only that the rich and the poor alike have no right to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets and to steal bread.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.743" offset="1210389">I submit that the right to take the appeal depends upon the right to search for the hidden error in a complete transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.021" offset="1427414">I said that to deny poor man appeal for warrant of the opportunity to search the transcript -- the trial of which he was convicted is no different to deny him the right to appeal for one of a filling fee because if he had the money to buy the transcript, if he could buy the transcript, he might be find the error and if the error is there and he can't find it, if he had it and could appeal if he found it, you're denying him the equal right to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.017" offset="1635453">As far as I'm concerned, any system which makes hidden error a ground for reversal and does it reply a proper observation and notice and preservation of the point below carries with it inevitably the requirement of the opportunity to find the error be accorded.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.646" offset="2873971">I think that it did -- well, the notion that the transcript ought to be denied in the federal system is based on the assumption that somehow converses responsible for this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.069" offset="2935620">And then I think it's based done on misreading of 28 U.S.C. Section 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.784" offset="2962474">The assumptions are that under that statute, the indigent unlike the solvent defendant either has the one assumed the burden of proving substantiality or to specify errors as a condition of being allowed to appeal in the form of proverbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.447" offset="3029138">Now, if either of those disparities really existed, if Congress really provided for that, then a serious constitutional question would be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.495" offset="3069367">But copied, as we read it put an end to the first idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.466" offset="3085249">The burden is not on the indigent but on the Government to prove insubstantiality and there is nothing in the second section which lends the slightest support to the second idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.646" offset="3129971">All that Section 1915 requires is that the convict state in his affidavit, "The nature of the action defense or appeal and defiance belief that he's entitled to redress."</text>
            <text syncTime="769.373" offset="3180857">If the indigent is not required to specify errors at that stage of the case, how can it possibly be argued that Congress tried the indigents appointed counsel to those portions of the record which relate to errors that the indigent pro se has superfluously specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.660" offset="3254000">The only semblance of plausibility as we see it in the Government's argument is that Section 1915 does say that in appeal may not be taken inform of papyrus, if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.346" offset="3312724">The consequence of that provision is that where the error is hidden, the indigenous confronted with the District Court finding of frivolity before his appellant counsel has even with a chance to look at the record whereas the solvent defendant cannot be faced with a challenged on frivolity ground until his appellant counsel has either filed his statement of points on appeal or has filed his brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.034" offset="3419512">Rule 75 (b), if the federal has criminal procedures specifically provide that no assignment of errors is necessary, we take it that that is true in the form of papyrus case as much than any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.514" offset="3469458">It is only if the appellant does not designate for inclusion the complete record at all the proceedings and evidence in the action that he's required to serve with his designation a concise statement of the points on which he intense to rely on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.872" offset="3522853">Now of course, before any paid lawyer would file a statement of points on appeal, he will have coned the entire stenographic record for every piece of reversible error he can possibly find.</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.436" offset="4297122">We submit that the minimum constitutional condition of requiring indigents to face a frivolity hurdle at an earlier state then solvent defendants have to face it, is that indigent's counsel must be provided with the same opportunity paid counsel have to search the record for ammunition to meet such an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.901" offset="4378937">That means that the entire stenographic record must be made available promptly to appointed counsel faced for the finding of frivolity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.824" offset="4410702">The Government says this distracts the tracks unduly from the weight that was be given to the District Court's finding of frivolity, but the Government is very significantly silent about the duty that Ellison poses both on counsel and on the Courts of Appeals to search diligently for error with which to upset the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.276" offset="4504430">It is that word as -- we remarked, determined colloquy with Mr. Justice Goldberg which this Court has never envisage it seems to me before in this context in which requires the result for which we contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.554" offset="4557615">Restriction of transcripts to indigents explained as a safeguard against the wasteful abuse of the appellant process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.051" offset="4583528">But as long as the plain error rules stand withholding a full transcript from indigents could be justified only if there were some connection between the defendant's solvency and the potentiality of unnoticed error so that there would be less chance on hidden error in indigent's cases than in other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.311" offset="4672658">Well, there is a connection, alright, but it works just the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.863" offset="4694810">This Court observed in Coppedge that forma pauperis defendants are generally less ably defended in the trial court than solvent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.941" offset="4731173">Therefore, it is more not less likely that the records in the case of the indigent will contain unnoticed plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.391" offset="4772968">Obviously therefore, to make ability to pay the test for opportunity to search a record for unnoticed error is that their impunity of invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.459" offset="4821243">Of course as I say, our argument would have no relevancy in a judicial system in which no appeal can be taken except for errors noted and preserved the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.157" offset="4863979">This, we think, is all this Court had in mind when it reaffirmed in Draper versus Washington, Griffin statement that a state did not provide parts of the stenographic transcript which are not germane to an appeal nor our courts need we be concerned about problems which may exist when transcript tuck unavailable, for Congress is to make sure that in the federal system, transcripts are available, and where a transcript is available, Government must supply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.769" offset="4986441">Every appellate lawyer knows that in searching for hidden error, there can be no substitute for a stenographic transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.439" offset="6125171">All of that would have been unnecessary I suggest if a full transcript is required in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.234" offset="6156309">Likewise Griffin versus Illinois makes it clear that a full transcript is not required in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.575" offset="6201657">It is also clearly contrary to the policy of Section 1950 to acquire a transcript, a full transcript in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.319" offset="6248678">Technically, I suppose that the granting of the transcript is not the same as the granting of the appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.998" offset="6355362">Likewise, Section 753 (e) of Title 28, envisages a transcript granted after lead to appear in forma pauperis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.070" offset="12335626">To me, the one thing that Mr. Claiborne's discussion of the shifting sands of Court of Appeals policy has done is to demonstrate that there is no basis for the assumption which Mr. Harlan indulged when he asked Mr. Claiborne what this case was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.485" offset="12397275">Namely, whether assuming Congress has spoken on this subject, then are we who reverse Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.799" offset="12442520">If Congress has spoken on this subject, how does it happen that the Government and the Court of Appeals can decide to grant indigents without making anymore claim of error than has been made in this case, a full transcript if the cost is under $200 but not if it's over it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.221" offset="12516289">Where in the statutes does it say that it equals an appeal to give a transcript if the cost is under $200 but it doesn't equal an appeal if the cost is over $200?</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.999" offset="12563414">Where in Section 1915 or any other statute of the code does it say that in order to honor the District Court's certificate of frivolity, you must deny a transcript to an indigent in order to permit his counsel an opportunity to prove that the District Court is wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.955" offset="12631228">The fact to the matter is that this policy of the Court of Appeals are requiring counsel to come forward with some assurance to the Court that they have done a job of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.479" offset="12673337">It seems to me, it can do nothing but to lead, to invite something less than complete candidate for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.626" offset="12701863">How can counsel in good faith say that there's a substantial basis to allege that there is inadequate evidence in the record that the District Attorney has been unduly pierced in his attack upon the defendant if he hasn't read what has been said?</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.872" offset="12750869">Whose word is he to take of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.068" offset="12755675">Is this the way we expect lawyers to operate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.897" offset="12762990">Is this the kind of representations to the Court have a right from expect from Bar?</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.219" offset="12776260">I don't believe it and I think that to avoid what to me is an unseemly business, this Court in the exercise of its supervisory power should demand that lawyers' function in a way that appellate lawyers always function.</text>
