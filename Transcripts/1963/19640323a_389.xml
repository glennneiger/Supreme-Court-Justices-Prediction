            <label>Mr. William S. Riley</label>
            <text syncTime="14.797" offset="162565">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.767" offset="182418">The issue in our case is fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.209" offset="204257">Can the Commonwealth of Kentucky levy an occupational or a license control tax on the business of respondent that bid is being the bringing of Scotch whisky into the Commonwealth which is complementary to a like tax on the business of distilling or manufacturing whisky in the Commonwealth without violating the Import-Export Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.564" offset="321599">Now, by regulation, this tax is made payable at the time the import permits are obtained from the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.073" offset="383666">But the statute provides that the tax could be paid as late as 15 days after the whisky had reached the respondent's bonded warehouse, his private bonded warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.532" offset="437478">But as a matter of control, it's made payable at the time of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.968" offset="463287">As briefly the facts in this case are that the respondent had contracted with a Scotch distiller to purchase several thousand gallons of Scotch whisky in the original casks and some in bottles, already cased for the consumer market, shipped from the port of Glasgow, Scotland moved to ports of Chicago and New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.465" offset="581256">There it was unloaded in customs bond, placed on an approved bonded carrier and transported to Louisville, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.686" offset="618141">From there, it was picked up by another approved bonded carrier and moved to the respondent's place of business in Clermont, Kentucky, his private bonded warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.613" offset="665788">Now, some of this whisky was in about 185% proof, it's not drinkable until it's removed from the cask, distilled water is added, in other word, is cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.593" offset="713749">Some of it of course was already bottled.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.996" offset="731408">As early as 1890, in the Wilson Act in 1913 and in the Webb-Kenyon Act, Congress gave its consent to state regulation of liquor regardless of whether or not it was in the original package.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.415" offset="797027">And this Court affirmed that grant of power in 1913, De Bary against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.220" offset="824299">But be that as it may, we believe that the Twenty-first Amendment has treated this type of product of -- as a unique type of product and has reserved to the States the absolute control up to the point of prohibiting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.587" offset="909772">And as Your Honors know in many States, there is local option which absolutely prohibits liquor in many counties and that's true in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.991" offset="951359">The only thing that Kentucky is doing here is attempting to control the entry of this whisky into the State, as this Court permitted in Gordon against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.682" offset="998066">In fact, the Gordon case is absolute on all force with what Kentucky is trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.452" offset="1025128">There, the State of Texas was permitted to collect its import tax on several gallons of rum in an individual's car which he was carrying across the State of Texas into his home in North Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.634" offset="1149889">The individual was arrested and required to pay a fine and pay the tax as a matter of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.702" offset="1198164">That's what Kentucky is trying to do here and of course, this Court affirmed the case per curiam, citing Carter against Virginia, where this Court permitted that very same thing to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.689" offset="1246124">The State of Virginia to seize whisky moving across that State from a point outside of Virginia to a point in North Carolina because the bonding and moving requirements had not been met with and it cited, of course, the Carter case cites Ziffrin against Reeves which arose in the Commonwealth of Kentucky where Kentucky was permitted to seize whisky that was moving on routes in the State which had been approved by Kentucky's Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.103" offset="2971773">The sole question involved in this case, as I see it, is whether or not the Twenty-first Amendment has repealed pro tanto the Import-Export Clause of the Constitution being Article I, Section 10, Clause 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.891" offset="3042931">Now, if the Twenty-first Amendment has done that and I have no standing in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.943" offset="3071143">But I insist that isn't so, as the authorities would bear me out.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.393" offset="3116910">I would like to trace very briefly, as suggested by Justice Stewart a while ago, the movement of this liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.273" offset="3164453">The James B. Beam Distilling Company owns and operates a bourbon distillery at Clermont, Kentucky, which is near Bardstown, about 50 miles from Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.374" offset="3208861">It also has a contract with the Gilbey Company of London -- England, William E. Gilbey &amp; Son by which the Beam Company has become the sole distributor of a brand of Scotch whisky known as "Gilbey's Spey Royal" in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.176" offset="3292035">Beam places an order by mail or telegraph or telephone with Gilbey in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.623" offset="3321814">The whisky is loaded on shipboard in Glasgow, Scotland, proceeds across the Atlantic either through the port of New Orleans but generally, more often through the port of Chicago that is through the Saint Lawrence Seaway down through Lake Michigan to the port of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.500" offset="3401331">Now, under custom's regulations, that whisky is traveling in bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.599" offset="3429752">The mast of the ship must present to the customs officer in Chicago a manifest showing just what whisky is on board, what do imported whisky is on board, to whom it is consigned and the quantity in gallons or cases, whatever it happens to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.248" offset="3520345">At the dock in Chicago has received in customs bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.778" offset="3538526">Then the next step on the Treasury Regulations, a carrier who has received a permit from the customs official, picks up that liquor, he receives an inventory of it and hauls it down through the State of Indiana under his carrier's permit and with the bill of lading in customs bond, the seal of the Government on the truck to Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.704" offset="3674154">The river -- at the --at the river, the Ohio river, the boundary between Indiana and Kentucky, Kentucky says, “Stop.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.531" offset="4033494">Well, the Beam Distilling Company, before it can bring that liquor across the river in to Kentucky, must apply to the Department of Revenue at Frankfort for a permit, designated as an import permit, and must describe the number of gallons to be imported and must pay the tax at the rate of 10 cents a gallon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.038" offset="4147493">All of which appear on the photostats of the permits in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.546" offset="4641520">The whisky arrives in at Shepherdsville at the Beam Distilling Company -- I mean at Clermont, Kentucky, at the Beam Distilling Company and it's immediately put into their Class 2 or Class 8 customs-bonded warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.342" offset="4696691">All of which are -- are provided for in the Treasury Regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.399" offset="4860949">Well, when Beam wants to withdraw this whisky from customs bond, he must pay two types of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.100" offset="4891773">He must pay the internal revenue tax of $10.50 proof gallon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.558" offset="4917582">He must also pay the import tax of $1.27 a gallon, the customs officer collecting that tax, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division collecting the other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.584" offset="4965752">That, in brief, Your Honors, is the method in which this whisky is received and I'd like to emphasize the fact that the taxing point is at the state line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.412" offset="6425057">The Court held that there was no substance to the contention that the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, that's at 27 U.S. Code 201, Section 211 was unconstitutional because the Twenty-first Amendment gave the States complete and exclusive control over commerce in intoxicating liquors.</text>
