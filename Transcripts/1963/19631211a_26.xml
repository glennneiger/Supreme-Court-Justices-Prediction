            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="35.669" offset="246053">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.607" offset="257755">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.880" offset="278862">The case arises of course under the National Labor Relations Act Section 8 (a) (1) of that Act makes it unlawful for an employer to interfere with or restrain or coerce the employer's employees in the exercise of their right to engage in self-organization and to select bargaining representatives of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.711" offset="374262">Our problem here is whether an employer violates the statutory prohibition when in the course of a union's organizing efforts, campaign and immediately prior to a board election, he grants to the employees economic benefits for the purpose of inducing them to reject the union but without expressly conditioning the benefits upon the employees voting against the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.845" offset="494738">The facts which underlie this controversy are not in dispute and I shall summarize them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.508" offset="521383">On October of 1959, the Boilermakers union began a campaign to organize the company's employees which numbered approximately 230.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.041" offset="571538">On November 9th of that year, the Boilermakers wrote to the company stating that the majority employees had designated it as their -- as the bargaining representative and requesting the company need to meet for the purpose of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.804" offset="634546">The company apparently did not respond to this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.709" offset="650219">And on November -- November 16th -- on November 16th, the union filed a petition with the Labor Board asking the Board to hold an election for the purpose of formally determining whether the employees wish to be represented by the Boilermakers union for purpose of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.027" offset="739453">On February 19th, the Board, after customary proceedings, directed that an election be held and the election was scheduled for March 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.084" offset="791698">Now, in the inner goal, the company made no secret of its hostility to the union and sought to persuade and induce the employees to reject the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.493" offset="829315">On February 25th of 1960, some three weeks, approximately three weeks before the election, the company's Vice-President had a company sponsored dinner, spoke to the employees about the -- the pending election.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.557" offset="905592">He called attention -- he attacks -- he criticized the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.284" offset="916459">He attacks the union for having allegedly misrepresented certain benefits that the company had given to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.602" offset="941746">He also call attention to various benefits, which the company had to given to the employees in the past when there was no union in the picture, and he urged the employees, he urged the employees to vote -- to vote because as he quoted, the issue before them was whether they were going to retain the right -- their right to speak and act for themselves or whether they wanted to surrender that right to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.791" offset="1026487">On March 4, on March 4, two weeks before the election which had been ordered by the Board, the company sent to its employees a letter together with a pamphlet and a cartoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.512" offset="1077373">And in this -- in this communication, the company announced two changes in the employment conditions which would benefit the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.924" offset="1111019">And these two changes are the subject matter of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.989" offset="1127320">Now, before I describe, before I describe these two changes, which the company made in the employees -- in the employees' employment conditions, I think it would be appropriate for the Court to take note of the context in which these benefits were announced by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.389" offset="1200880">The letter, the pamphlet and the cartoon to which I have made reference are reprinted at pages 90 to 97 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.115" offset="1235884">And the opening paragraphs, the opening paragraphs of the company's letter of March 4th, I think, are fairly indicative of the tenure of the entire letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.222" offset="1276217">But I doubt if I can do justice of the company's stylistic bait and if I may, I should like to take a moment of the Court's time and read these opening paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.845" offset="1326791">The letter said, “To our fellow employees, you've got an envelope from us through the mail yesterday an empty envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.030" offset="1351450">You may have thought that we goofed, that we forgot to put something in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.907" offset="1367019">But we didn't forget, we didn't intend to put anything in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.606" offset="1381752">That empty envelope had everything that the Boilermakers have done for you and everything it can do for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.900" offset="1402964">That empty envelope brought home to you the empty promises of the union and the fact that it is the company that puts things in your envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.214" offset="1432221">Your paycheck, your vacation pay, your holiday pay, your insurance, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.598" offset="1449775">The union can't put any of those things in your envelope, only the company can do that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="341.328" offset="1468688">And then, the third whole -- opening paragraph, “Those of you who have been with us for some time, know the improvements had been made in your job, the benefits should now enjoy employees that make your job a good job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="353.229" offset="1516335">The fact that it didn't take the union to get any of those things and that it won't take a union to get additional improvements in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.436" offset="1549145">Now, the pamphlet then went on to say how well the employees at fair in the past without the benefit of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.545" offset="1577566">And it listed numerous benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.484" offset="1585298">It listed numerous benefits which the company had given to the employees from 1949 to 1960 including the two benefits which they say are the subject matter of this -- of this litigation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.906" offset="1635035">And finally, the -- the pamphlet found up on page 96 with a preemptory "Vote no, grow with (Inaudible)."</text>
            <text syncTime="395.851" offset="1686758">And then, there was attached to the pamphlet a cartoon, which I think which is reproduced at page 97, and the cartoon very dramatically and graphically illustrates, I think, the entire thrust of the message.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.386" offset="1736913">That cartoon said, “When all the shouting is done, remember, it's the company that has the jobs and pays the money, not the union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="417.717" offset="1774216">Now --</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="469.048" offset="1979538">I would doubt it very much that the Court would want to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.269" offset="1996466">Now, as I said it was in this context and that the two changes, the two changes in the employers' working additions were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.440" offset="2029171">Now, these two changes, these two changes, one dealt with the computation of overtime pay and the other dealt with vacations.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.863" offset="2062817">Now, prior to the announcement that was made of the change by the company, the company, in computing overtime pay, had not treated a working holiday -- a paid holiday, had not treated a paid holiday as working time for the purpose of computing overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.185" offset="2128123">Now, under the new plan, which the company announced two weeks before this election was be held by the Board, under this new plan, a working holiday would be counted, a working holiday would be counted for purposes of computing the overtime pay if the employee worked the day before and the day after the working holiday, and this meant as the company's communication stated to the employees that the employees would receive an additional $5 to $6 extra compensation for any week in which there was a paid holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.026" offset="2259466">And the company, at this time, had approximately six paid holidays for the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.234" offset="2280260">Now, the other change, the other benefit, the other benefit, which the company announced as I said, had to do with vacations.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.806" offset="2310562">Prior to this announcement, the employees' vacation -- paid vacation leave would start on a Friday and end on the Thursday of the following week.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.434" offset="2357060">So there was only one weekend intervening during that -- during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.300" offset="2380570">Under the new plan, under the new plan that company in effect increased the vacation from seven -- from seven to -- to eight and a half days.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.756" offset="2426441">Under the new plan, the employee could start -- would quit work at Saturday noon, his vacation would begin on the following Monday and then he wouldn't have to return until a week from that Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.804" offset="2474611">So the result of this change, although there -- the company did not pay any more than -- paid previously that many for one week, the result of this change was that the employee got an additional one-half days vacation, two weekends in fact instead of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.532" offset="2529468">And as the court below noted, this was a substantial fringe benefit to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.760" offset="2554441">Now, the election was held as scheduled and the union lost the election by a vote of 121 to 94.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.668" offset="2594043">Now, as I -- as Mr. Justice Goldberg has indicated, both the Board and the court below agree that these benefits were made by the employer that they were introduced for the purpose, for the purpose of inducing the employees to reject the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.693" offset="2662170">The Board held that in view of their timing and their motivation that these -- that the introduction of these benefits constituted the illegal interference and restraint on coercion with the employees right to engage in self-organization and their right to select bargaining representatives of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.183" offset="2732074">The court below on the other hand although agreeing that the -- the Board as for the purpose of the employer had in introducing the benefits, nevertheless, concluded that since the benefits were put into effect unconditionally and without any strings attached, any visible strings, without any visible strings attached, that this constituted a form of legitimate persuasion rather an illegal interference or restraint.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.040" offset="2975535">And well, it might be said that money does talk, that it does more than merely persuade.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.411" offset="3001031">We think that it restraints and coerces the employees' judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.790" offset="3018480">Now, one of the principle cornerstones of our National Labor Relations policy is embodied in the Act is the right of the employees to engage in self-organization and to select bargaining representatives of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.378" offset="3080861">Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act, Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act seeks to implement this guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.630" offset="3105938">And as this Court long ago confirmed in the Republic Aviation case, its dominant purposes to protect the exercise of this right against employer interference, restraint or coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.880" offset="3154944">Now, an employer may impair that freedom, impair those rights, impair those rights either through favors or through reprisals.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.795" offset="3190575">As the Seventh Circuit once putted in fairly classic form, interference has no less interference because it is accomplished through allureness rather than through coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.742" offset="3234356">Now, we are all agreed, we are all agreed that if an employer expressly conditions, expressly conditions benefits to employees upon their refraining from engaging in concerted activities or the -- from their refraining from joining a union or repudiating a union that if he so conditions these benefits, that this is a clear invasion, an illegal invasion of their statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.319" offset="3352639">As this Court said in the Medo Photo case a number of years ago, that could be no -- this is -- there could be no more obvious way of interfering with the employees' rights because the employer's action is put the employees in an economic squeeze and the freedom which he acts seeks to extend to the employees would be illusory indeed if the employer could condition the exercise upon rewards or punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.233" offset="3452322">Now, the court below, of course, if we would -- with the position of this Court in Medo Photo, but it thought there was a difference into this case because the employer, in granting the benefits, all the way granted them for the purpose of influencing this -- them to reject the union, nevertheless, since the benefits had been granted unconditionally and without any strings attached that such benefits could not influence the employees' judgment with respect to either job tenure or compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.668" offset="3581994">Now, we submit that in taking this position, the court below, the court below has misconceived the broad base upon which cases, like Medo Photo, are rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.495" offset="3633403">Now, the underlie -- the thesis -- the underlying thesis of cases like Medo Photo and they are many of them in the Court of Appeals, the underlying thesis in that case is not merely that an employer violates the Act when he insist upon, when he expressly insist upon a quid pro quo for the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.119" offset="3707800">The (Inaudible) thrust, the bar thrust of those cases is that the Act bars an employer from using his econ -- the economic power which he alone has all that the employees in order to influence their judgment and to induce them to adjure -- to refrain from engaging in -- in concerted activities or to reject the union because the announcement of the benefits by an employer at a time when it's critical time in a union's organizing efforts or before a board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.132" offset="3847920">And where it's apparent as it was in this case that the employer's purpose, that the employer's purpose is to induce them to reject the union in that kind of a setting dealing introduction of such benefits necessarily we asserting, necessarily carries in the eyes of the employees either the threat, either the threat that these benefits will be withdrawn if they fail to exceed to their -- their employer's manifest desires and wishes or that if they do comply with those manifest desires and wishes and reject the union that they will retain them and perhaps that it maybe even more coming in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.284" offset="4000475">An employer would -- we believe, would have to be obtuse indeed not to anticipate.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.834" offset="4026702">It appears in the pressures which his action in these circumstances here would engender the minds of the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.861" offset="6518784">But it seems like the heart of its -- the heart of its position is, that is on page 127, that where the Court says here, "The benefits were put into effect unconditionally on a permanent basis and no one suggest there was any implication that benefits would be withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.954" offset="6583150">If the work is voted for the unions, the employees were as free after the establishment of the new benefits as they were beforehand to vote for or against the union according to their own wishes untrammelled by considerations of the impact your decision would have on their job security, compensation or relations with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.651" offset="6650023">And as I said earlier in the argument, I think that the Court has -- has misconceived not only the basis upon which the Medo Photo case rest, that once the employer throws into the scales, his economic way even though he has not said to the employees "In terms, you'll be punished if you don't follow me, if you don't exceed to my manifest desires."</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.456" offset="6909158">But this Court found not only the employer violate 8 (a) (5) by dealing directly with the employees but it also found an independent 8 (a) (1), 8 (a) (1) and saying the language, which I quoted a moment ago, there could be no more obvious way for an employer interfere with his employees' rights by seeking to persuade them to reject the union or abandon the union by offering them -- by offering them increase wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.770" offset="7078431">But I suggest, Your Honor, that the argument is really wide of the mark.</text>

            <text syncTime="1773.898" offset="7199013">And we submit that it is, that Congress meant to preclude, that Congress meant to preclude an employer from using that power, which I say which he alone has, to influence the judgment because, as I've said and I will close on this note, there could be no more obvious way of restraining the employees from the exercise of their freedom.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.515" offset="7329416">One may be given to wonder, I think, how it is that it took more than 25 years for this question to reach this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.693" offset="7378108">I think the answer lies in the fact that while it penetrates to the very roots of the Act, the cut is very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.945" offset="7431189">We think that is because the facts of this particular case bring the question to a very sharp point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.770" offset="7482493">We found no case like this one and neither did the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.394" offset="12744913">We don't think that's what the extents for but anyway, here's what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.269" offset="12772498">The record shows that we had a payroll period that ended on Thursday and we paid on Friday each week.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.811" offset="12806666">Our plant had grown to such an extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.518" offset="12813458">The accounting department couldn't close the payroll one night and make the checks the next morning so we were faced with the fact, this is in the record, I happen to be there, which adds nothing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.491" offset="12853373">And the question was, we've got to give the accounting department more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.259" offset="12864449">We got to roll the payroll week back to end on Wednesday and still pay on Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.472" offset="12893288">That then left the way in which we have been scheduling vacations beginning on Friday and in the following Thursday not to coincide with anything, and the question was, shall we will leave it hanging?</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.479" offset="12937279">Should we move it back?</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.106" offset="12943757">Some change has to be made that no longer bears any relationship to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.510" offset="12961416">And I made the suggestion, I think the record indicates it but that still doesn't make it any better than someone else has made it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.556" offset="12985553">I made the suggestion that start on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.716" offset="12998196">And we gave them exactly the same length of vacation, exactly the same vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.119" offset="13023796">And we thought that it was not actually an economic benefit but Judge Brown suggested that they were fishermen that might have an extra weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.764" offset="13054412">But the day and a half to which counsel alludes from Saturday noon until Monday next, was there a normal regular time off not -- admittedly, they could couple that with their vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.846" offset="13098715">I believe its Saturday noon and not come back until the second Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.010" offset="13115434">So that put their normal time off at both ends of their vacation period.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.930" offset="13827114">The union may have been by reason of the fact that the employees were rendered less susceptible to the blandishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.515" offset="13853445">And the empty envelope, if Your Honor please, was in response to the union's constant statement by bulletin to the employees, "If you vote us in, we'll get you this, this and this" on the very eve of our meeting to which counsel referred in March.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.038" offset="13919483">The union says "Whatever the company gives you, we will get you double at the bargaining table."</text>
