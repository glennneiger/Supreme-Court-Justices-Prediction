            <text syncTime="10.460" offset="145220">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.427" offset="161102">This case, brought by the United States under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, involves the acquisition by the Continental Can Company of the Hazel-Atlas Glass Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.909" offset="218990">The acquisition was consummated in 1956, following the denial of a restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.053" offset="259636">The case did not come on for trial until June 1960, at which time it was heard by Judge Frederick Bryan in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.254" offset="308433">The trial lasted in all for some six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.591" offset="329749">During its course, the Government introduced more than a thousand exhibits then presented 70 odd witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.731" offset="370291">After the Government's case was completed, the District Court on Continental's motion dismissed the case out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.243" offset="416371">In granting the motion to dismiss, the Court issued a brief oral opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.145" offset="443956">That was in December of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.302" offset="460570">More than two years later, in April of 1963, the Court issued an elaborate opinion of some 80 printed pages which it said, would also constitute its findings of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.996" offset="543326">There was briefing in the (Inaudible) Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.701" offset="566209">The case, we think, is one of large importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.352" offset="588779">One striking aspect, I'm not suggesting that it alone is decisive, is at this litigation involves the amalgamation of two national giants.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.260" offset="640397">Both of the companies in question were among the country's 500 largest corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.420" offset="677073">Another aspect which makes the case a portentous one in these days of widespread diversification by entry into the fields of substitute products is that we deal here very largely with interindustry, as distinguished from intraindustry competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.833" offset="786683">Indeed, the essence of the Government's case is that there is highly significant competition between two reasonably interchangeable products, the tin can and the glass container.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.677" offset="858049">And a strong reason to apprehend that the acquisition will, in Section 7 terms, substantially, lessened that competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.199" offset="908204">Now, I'm not, for a moment, proposing to deny that glass containers and tin cans have distinguishable characteristics, nor am I suggesting that each of them does not constitute by itself, an identifiable line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.552" offset="981556">Surely, if Continental Can were to acquire American Can Company next week, the antitrust division would question that merger and surely it would say that it was unnecessary to look beyond the confines of the can industry in order to determine whether its effects made such a merger a forbidden venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.186" offset="1092106">I think it's a truism that whenever there are two products, which from the standpoint of the users of those products, have a degree of interchangeability or substitutability but are not so close to one another as to be fungible that there's bound to be both intraindustry and interindustry competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.101" offset="1207777">In the economists terms, the cross-elasticity of demand as between the two products will vary from user to user.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.522" offset="1257409">If, for example, one packer finds it advantageous to place his goods in a transparent container, he almost certainly is going to use glass even if the tin can maybe somewhat cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.847" offset="1330761">Conversely, a packer who wants an opaque container is surely going to use the tin can.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.300" offset="1360541">A -- a third producer who doesn't care much either way, may be guided by a comparative price.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.564" offset="1393664">My example of course is an oversimplified one.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.207" offset="1408188">Many perhaps most users will consider a variety of characteristics before striking a balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.815" offset="1502647">-- that kind of competition also.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.498" offset="1517380">We take the du Pont cellophane case that is suggested one here, Judge Bryan found support for his judgment in the comment in this Court's cellophane opinion, I quote it, "One can think of building materials as in commodity competition, but one can hardly say that brick competes with steel or wood or cement or stone in the meaning of Sherman Act litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.350" offset="1648724">The products are too different."</text>
            <text syncTime="388.701" offset="1658128">And Judge Bryan, as I say, relied on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.774" offset="1674428">Yet of course, that very case, the cellophane case, held that du Pont's monopoly position was not to be measured solely by its reference to its power vis-à-vis the other manufacturers of cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.426" offset="1741093">But was to consider additionally, the manufacturers of glassine, wax paper, pliofilm, kraft paper and various other flexible packaging materials, albeit, those materials had differing qualities and characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.855" offset="1822804">Now, whether or not cellophane's distinguishing characteristics should have led to the conclusion, as the Government argued in that case, that it might be separately monopolized, no one would question, I take it, that cellophane and the principle substitutes with which it competes would also constitute a relevant market under the antitrust laws and particularly under Section 7, which relates to any line of commerce and which this Court had said, reaches among other things, even conglomerate mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.030" offset="1979538">Now, I think the first step in evaluating competition between products has to be an assessment of their general characteristics and uses.Both cans and jars of course are rigid containers and both are impermeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.443" offset="2049128">This makes them susceptible of uses for packaging an infinite variety of items which come in liquid, solid or even gaseous form.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.537" offset="2105553">It permits packaging in a way that will make the content secure from injury or deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.254" offset="2140348">In addition, both types of containers are capable of being heated to relatively high temperatures and accordingly, both are used as -- all of us are aware in great quantities, in the important food canning industry, in which of course, the process of preparation involves sterilization by heat, followed by hermetic sealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.272" offset="2248495">A leading food scientist too was called as a witness, testified that there are no comparable containers from the standpoint of preventing food spoilage.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.609" offset="2301785">Now, to be sure, there are also significant differences between cans and glass containers, the cans for one thing, are less bulky, lighter in weight although the record here shows that the glass industry, conscious of this competitive factor, has made important strives in making ware which both lighter and stronger than the traditional glass container.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.568" offset="2425605">Witness the throwaway beer bottle, which of course competes actively with the beer can.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.130" offset="2455907">Another difference is that glass is chemically inert.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.370" offset="2468864">It won't react with the contents placed therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.567" offset="2485687">Tin plate on the other hand, will react with various substances, a problem which the can manufacturers meet for their part by using a particular type of lining or coating when the can is designed for certain end uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.209" offset="2552247">Of course for many end uses, the same kind of can is acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.088" offset="2567711">The same type will be used for foods, for human consumption, for pet foods and indeed for motor oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.425" offset="2605119">Now as to the relative cost of the two types of containers from the customer's standpoint, it is difficult to generalize.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.742" offset="2654333">Probably, glass is the more expensive, more often than not but this varies considerably from case-to-case.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.268" offset="2696443">For example, the soft drink can and the beer can are somewhat costlier than the bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.374" offset="2724864">This results from the fact that those cans have to be specially sealed at the seams in order to resist the pressures of the beverage and this makes them costlier to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.625" offset="2773870">An important factor from the cost standpoint is whether the user will incur added costs by using one type of container rather than the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.003" offset="3115342">In its headed competition of glass versus tin and it begins by saying that attached are data sheets, summarizing information received from division offices on the comparative cost of tin and glass containers for the following products, and it lists a number of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.750" offset="3194337">Then further down, Continental observes in general, the glass package is less expensive to the packer of non-processed food items.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.904" offset="3238954">The closure cost of the jar makes the glass package more expensive for processed food.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.713" offset="3266226">And then on the next page, Continental can illustrates this by referring various types of -- various commodities which are packaged in the two containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.513" offset="3321396">It says, "For processed foods from a price standpoint, we are in a favorable position and consumer preference will dictate how much goes in glass."</text>
            <text syncTime="814.331" offset="3360684">On baby food it says, "Our baby food can prices would seem to offer attraction to the packer to use tin but the customers here appear to prefer glass."</text>
            <text syncTime="825.161" offset="3404048">On insecticides, they say the packer seems to prefer tin but should our can prices further increase, the lower cost of glass may offer a saving which the buyer cannot afford to pass up.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.355" offset="3460786">On instant coffee, they observed, "We will have to guard against any material increase in the price of our soluble coffee if we want to make in droves on the glass container volume.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.491" offset="3821380">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.572" offset="3833710">The significant fact here, as to the matter of price, and this much one can generalize is that that the differentials are relatively small.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.432" offset="3889089">They're nowhere near the differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.909" offset="3895045">For example, that one had in the cellophane case, whereas Your Honors will recall, cellophane ran from more than twice to more than seven times as much as some of the various materials found to be competitive with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.198" offset="3972159">Now, of course, the tin cans and the glass containers come in all forms, shapes and sizes but all that needs to be said on that score is that the major companies are quite capable of making them in all forms, shapes and sizes and to ship very rapidly to meet any orders which could they could obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.234" offset="4060348">Let me now shift the focus a moment from the characteristics of the two products to the characteristics of the two industries and the two companies involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.172" offset="4120012">According to figures accepted by the Court, the can industry, in 1957, produced over 41 billion tin cans and the glass industry, over 18 billion glass containers, a total of approximately 60 billion and a ratio of more than 2 to 1, little more than 2 to 1 in favor of the can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.769" offset="4230457">Now, we had roughly 150 million people in this country in the 1950s which would mean that approximately 400 tin cans or glass containers were being made for each man, woman and child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.806" offset="4302555">About one-half of the glass and more than two-thirds of the tin cans went into one form or another of a food container, using food in its broadest sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.809" offset="4358562">That incidentally, is an area in which Hazel-Atlas had always been particularly active, the food containers for food products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.618" offset="4389804">It was not so active.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.089" offset="4395760">It was relatively small in soft drinks and beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.985" offset="4411329">It was also active in making containers for the drug, toiletry, cosmetics, industries, and for household and industrial products, but food was perhaps its biggest field of concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.460" offset="4477262">Now, who makes these 40 billion odd cans?</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.235" offset="4500355">The Court found that American Can, the leader, had approximately 38% of that market and that Continental had approximately 33%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.049" offset="4547584">So the two leading can companies have over 70% of the market, not surprisingly, the Economists have cited this as a prime example of duopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.845" offset="4598784">Not surprisingly, the indications in the record are that price changes within its industry, took a follow-the-leader pattern.Continental itself was organized in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.942" offset="4659179">It had a rapid growth in part as a result of internal expansion and part is a result of acquisitions of which it made more than 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.520" offset="4693452">It operates some 70 plants, more than 40 of them in can manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.221" offset="4716231">After its acquisition of Hazel-Atlas in 1956, it had annual net sales and operating revenues of more than a billion dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.894" offset="4754996">Turning to the glass industry, the leading company is Owens-Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.168" offset="4772028">It had about 35% of the total production of glass containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.405" offset="4793031">Anchor-Hocking was second with about 12% and Hazel-Atlas, third with slightly under 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.459" offset="4829184">Hereto, the picture is one of concentration, though not as great.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.381" offset="4960946">That leaves three companies with approximately 57% of that industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.791" offset="4990516">Hazel-Atlas was organized about the turn of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.406" offset="5005040">It was one of the pioneers in the glass industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.669" offset="5022072">It grew steadily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.149" offset="5027924">It was consistently profitable until its acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.066" offset="5051643">What its production is today, we don't know from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.139" offset="5063973">We do know that in 1955, Hazel-Atlas produced in one and three-quarter billion glass containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.192" offset="5092185">In 1957, the first full year after the acquisition, its production was down 140 million units, although the totals for the industry were off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.567" offset="5137638">Those figures are at record 2968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.060" offset="5155610">Now, we do not dispute that there is keen competition for markets by the glass companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.021" offset="5187480">As with cans, however, it appears that the price structure is a rigid one and is determined by the industry leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.831" offset="5222693">This point was succinctly made by the test -- in the testimony of the president of Glenshaw Glass who testified at record 394 that his company cannot charge anymore than Owens-Illinois and certainly, wouldn't take any less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.197" offset="5292178">Other glass manufacturers testified to like effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.927" offset="5311091">Now, I emphasized this lack of vigorous price competition with in each of the two industries because it seems plain to us that in such industries, the role of the competition provided by substitute products is of particular importance to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.707" offset="5390190">Now, as I've already indicated, the competition, the -- both active and potential, between glass and can, extends over a wide range of categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.514" offset="5433448">We suggest, therefore, that the most meaningful line of commerce in which to appraise the effects of this merger is the production and sale of containers for all of the many purposes for which metal and glass containers may both be used, including particularly, beverages, foods, household and chemical goods, cosmetic and drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.599" offset="5537729">In the District Court, the Government urged that the merger would adversely affect the entire packaging industry and both the can and the glass industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.331" offset="5580675">In addition, we urged that the merger would impair competition in numerous submarkets, for example, the market for containers provided by food canners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.327" offset="5628635">We've dealt with that food canning submarket in our brief but our primary emphasis and I shall confine myself to it here, is to the composites that I have described, the uses for which -- the end uses for which these containers compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.975" offset="5711287">Now, I -- I do note in passing, as Mr. Justice Stewart has suggested earlier, that plastics and paper containers are also to a degree in the broad market represented by the end uses of cans and glass containers, that's toiletries, cosmetics, drugs are not in frequently found in the plastic tube or container.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.184" offset="5808149">However, the record does show that for most of the purposes for which glass and metal are used, they alone are practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.984" offset="5847333">The time of the merger moreover, the total business in the plastic field was about $30 million as compared to sales of well over two billion for glass and tin cans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1513.847" offset="6158712">The District Court stated on this matter of interindustry competition, Hazel-Atlas and Continental were part of an overall industrial pattern, each in a recognized separate industry producing distinct products but engaged in interindustry competition for the favor of various end-users of their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.852" offset="6254738">At another point, it said this interindustry competition was substantial, but the Court then proceeded to hold that this was insufficient to make such products which it repeated, came from separate and distinct industries, a line of commerce for Section 7 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.997" offset="6347316">And that is our basic quarrel with the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.321" offset="6368632">We suggest that the Court had an erroneous and two exacting, a view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.348" offset="6396740">That it believed apparently, that there must be substantial parody or equivalents between the substitute products in order for the competition to be protected by the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.006" offset="6451388">I infer this from its constant emphasis upon the fact that the industries are separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.011" offset="6479391">From its preoccupation with the fact that variables enter into the buyer's choice whether it take a can or a glass container for his packaging needs from its reliance upon the steel versus wood language of the cellophane opinion to which I referred earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.726" offset="6554311">And finally, from some of the comments to which I shall soon refer, which it made in connection with the evidence offered at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.288" offset="6592554">Now, it's not -- I repeat, our contention that there is anything like perfect or plastic competition between these two differing products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.486" offset="6625364">We do say that there is substantial or be it imperfect competition that each product exercises a significant limiting force upon the price which the other can command as indeed, each of the industries as acutely aware that these limitations are particularly important in the context of two industries, each of which is concentrated and characterized by a lack of strenuous internal price competition and that the preservation of this interindustry competition is within the purposes of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.937" offset="6775097">Now, one of preliminary ways in which the Government showed that cans and glass containers are reasonably interchangeable, this was a rough and preliminary line of proof but we think, persuasive nonetheless, was by sending investigators into various retail establishments in numerous cities, into grocery stores, drugstores, supermarkets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.710" offset="6878229">They surveyed what was on the shelves, making appropriate notations whenever they saw that same item or type of item in both can and glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.493" offset="6921383">As a sample, I should refer Your Honors to the alphabetical listing at record 3123 in volume 4, which was made up by FBI agents who went to a series of Los Angeles stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.644" offset="6985958">And you'll find there about five or six pages of items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.277" offset="7004453">Under (a) for example, you'll find among others ammonia, anchovies, antiseptics, apple sauce, apricots, artichokes, asparagus, aspirin and goes on for pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.053" offset="7059623">Some of the lists prepared by the FBI agents are more detailed, giving sizes or brands or prices of the items as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.578" offset="7101733">Now, Continental Can attacks these surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.999" offset="7115316">It says they take insufficient account of material differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.998" offset="7135378">For example, in cross examining, one of the FBI agents who had noted on his list that Nescafe which is a soluble or instant coffee was put up in both bottles and in cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.447" offset="7197132">Continental's lawyers brought out quite properly on cross-examination that Nescafe in the tin was an after-dinner style coffee and not so in the glass jar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.987" offset="7243316">Also, that there was a marked difference in price between the two varieties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.247" offset="7280410">The fact that the contents were not the same is -- is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.504" offset="7297337">The point remains, however, in our view, that if the instant coffee, whether French after-dinner style or American garden variety, can be packed in either tins or in glass but it does show that the packer has a substantial alternative or choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.871" offset="7386885">Judge Bryan, however, agreed with the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.896" offset="7402977">He stated that since the Nescafe was of two different varieties, the evidence that was packed in two different containers and I quote him, "Had no probative value, none whatsoever."</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.958" offset="7459192">And that appears on record 1053.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.172" offset="7476015">Now, this is an indication of what I meant when I suggested earlier that the District Judge appeared to us to have rather an elastic views on cross-elasticity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.468" offset="7529200">Perhaps, this point is -- is worth illustrating further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.426" offset="7545083">The defendants took the same FBI agent to test because he reported seeing olives in both jars and in tins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.239" offset="7580296">Their point again and perfectly a proper one was that green olives were always found in glass and black olives were always found in the tin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.129" offset="7623868">Again, however, I think one is fairly left with the conviction that packers of olives, whether green or ripe, must have a significant choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.843" offset="7666709">Nonetheless again, the District Court -- Court agreed with appellees and said that this evidence had no relevance at record 1055.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.026" offset="7707460">To this, I add the footnote that if you go to the delicate test and order, the supermarket today, you can find black olives in jars as well as in tins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.808" offset="7754585">Indeed, you can find black and green olives in the same jar, in the so-called banquet assortment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.196" offset="7784155">I don't offer this testimony to supplement the record but I do make the point that it is not unfitting in administering a statute which calls for an element of prediction to take into account that which is plausible ,if not, indeed are fixed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.581" offset="8133674">Well, let me -- let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.529" offset="8145481">The Government had called the Staff Director of the Glass -- Glass Container Manufacturers Institute to the stand as its witness, that's portrayed at the Glassmakers Trade Association, and he identified many documents, he testified as an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.676" offset="8214026">On cross-examination, Continental Can prepared a list of items, the list which you see before you on pages 26 to 29 and then asked this witness to estimate on the basis of his expert knowledge how much of each of this listed items went into glass and how much went into tin cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.231" offset="8328338">He did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.077" offset="8335653">Now, Continental suggests that indicates a lack of product interchangeability and I submit that it suggests to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.083" offset="8371702">I say that for this reason, the list shows to be sure that as to most of the items packaged, one of the two types of containers is markedly predominant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.286" offset="8436485">Yet, I would ask Your Honors to note that of all of the commodities listed, and these were selected and listed by Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.790" offset="8474520">All of the -- of all of the commodities listed on these four pages, it is said of only one item, paint, that none of it is packaged in glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.313" offset="8520600">And it is said, of only one item, salad dressing, that none of it is packaged in tin cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.310" offset="8544632">In all other instances where the witness uses the word, all, he follows it by the words, "Or substantially all."</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.526" offset="8577442">Now, I have little doubt on the basis of this record that packers tend to -- to move in packs, to adopt similar packaging techniques and marketing techniques until one enterprising company breaks the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.254" offset="8636374">For example, at one time, Your Honors, 100% of all baby foods came in cans, then Hazel-Atlas initiated the glass jar for baby foods, and ultimately, glass took over 80% of that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.383" offset="8700949">I suggest to you that even if 98% or 99% of a particular commodity is found in glass or 98% or 99% in tin, the 1% or 2% remaining is highly significant because it -- it shows that there is an option, an alternative way of packaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.597" offset="8781720">It shows that there are some competition already present and not merely an overhang.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.666" offset="8806066">Take soft drinks for example, which is on this list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.170" offset="8820067">Now, our friends had exact figures on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.010" offset="8835427">It show -- and the list shows 98.5% in bottles and 1.5% in cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.144" offset="8867924">Is that 1.5% insignificant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.416" offset="8880985">I can say unequivocally to Your Honors that this record shows that when the soft drink can came on the market, the glass industry was alarmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.038" offset="8927483">The glass manufactures and their trade association, GCMI, undertook a most vigorous campaign to counteract this threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.117" offset="8959875">And I can tell you also from the record that the counterpart association, the Can Manufacturers Institute, undertook a vigorous campaign including institutional advertising at a cost of millions of dollars to convince the public of the attractiveness of the soft drink can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.702" offset="9042213">Let me turn now from what can be seen on the supermarket shelves to some items of evidence which reflect the attitude of those who buy and use containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.884" offset="9086934">One such witness was the Director of Purchasing of Linens 'n Things, a large toiletries and cosmetics concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.829" offset="9118699">He testified that for many items packaged by his company, metal and glass represent practical alternative and that the comparative prices of the two are significant, though not necessarily crucial in the company's choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.064" offset="9183587">He said this was especially so in the case of low cost items because as to such items, the cost of the container might be 15% or 20% of the total price of the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.678" offset="9238131">Several small vegetable packers testified that until 1955 or 1956, they had canned all of their produce in tin, at which point, they begun to put a portion in glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.813" offset="9302601">Now, our opponents criticized this evidence because they say these packers are small and insignificant companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.987" offset="9339277">They were chosen, however, because they were small.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.322" offset="9356622">If two little vegetable canners find it within their means to switch readily from an old tin line to a tin and glass line, it is the more evident that there is flexibility and that the cost of the switch-over, are not prohibitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.358" offset="9436766">Incidentally, one of these vegetable packers that estimated his cost of putting in the glass line at $2000, the other at $3000 to $5000, and that testimony is at record 466 and 474.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.719" offset="9506252">Now, I think perhaps, most revealing is what the glass manufacturers and the can manufacturers themselves have said and done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.961" offset="9547212">I suggest that this record shows that they are as keenly conscious of the competition of the other as the manufacturers of olive oil or butter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.165" offset="9592038">Now, GCMI, the trade association to which I earlier referred, had numerous industry-manned committees, one important one was the Marketing Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.509" offset="9637386">Correspondence and minutes of that committee and its staff appear at length in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.581" offset="9661733">I'll have time to note that one or two items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.423" offset="9677093">One of these is the letter at record 1659 in which the Staff Director of the Marketing Committee reports that Continental Can had putout information implying that glass chips may find their way into baby food.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.284" offset="9756505">And further, the Continental Can had exaggerated the cost saving which might be affected by putting baby food in cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.089" offset="9791718">He describes this display of competition as really vicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.173" offset="9820035">Perhaps, the most suggestive activity of the GCMI Marketing Committee is that it continually conducted studies and surveys concerning the competition being experienced by glass and suggested ways and means by which glass sales could be expanded at the expense of that competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.311" offset="9912613">You will find, again, I won't take the time to go over it, a chart in one of these GCMI reports that appears at record 1757 and 1758, which lists numerous categories of items which are put up in glass and makes note of those items on which there is competition for metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.741" offset="10002369">GCMI estimated that it was experiencing such competition on more than half of the items listed -- listed and that there was potential competition on others.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.570" offset="10681657">And I'd like to turn you now to what some of the manufacturers themselves have said about this competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.704" offset="10710183">The chairman of the board of Owens-Illinois, in his testimony, spoke of the shock which the glass companies experienced when tomato juice first appeared in a can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.698" offset="10762115">He also confirmed the fact that his company in establishing price for its glass containers takes into account the price of tin plates and of metal containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.206" offset="10808195">I don't know whether steel manufacturers take into account reinforced concrete but the President of Owens-Illinois says they do take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.189" offset="10840168">That's at record 97.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.529" offset="10853439">Coming still closer to home, I'd like to take a few minutes to refer to another exhibit from Continental Can's files.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.863" offset="10906833">This is in volume 3, beginning at record 2553 and this I think is an important and very suggestive exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.209" offset="10964198">You will find on 2553, the picture of a design of a new type of can which Continental had developed, a can with a screw on top that made it easily reusable and which was given the name "saver lock," the saver lock can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.132" offset="11039848">This exhibit is literature of Continental's can which had put out apparently to its own personnel to acquaint them with this new development and to enable them to sell it to customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.005" offset="11095437">Now, Continental says, "These containers have been designed to meet the specific needs of many products now being marketed in glass."</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.614" offset="11141831">Going on, turning to 2556, it says, "Prospect to our comparing the merits of saver locked cans versus glass jars will find that the adoption of the saver locked can will enable them realize substantial savings."</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.222" offset="11216227">Then it illustrates that by many specific illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.025" offset="11235453">It says at 2558, "No attempt will be made here to list all of the product candidates for saver locked cans as almost any powdered or granulated product food or non-food is a possibility."</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.398" offset="11292923">It illustrates by saying that the saver locked can ought to offer an opportunity to takeover the instant coffee or a portion of it from glass jars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.386" offset="11336913">That the saver locked can should be very interesting to the concerns looking for a superior package to compete with glass jars in packaging dry milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.343" offset="11380694">It should be a powerful merchandising vehicle for those products which are now packaged principally in glass, in the sweetening or syrup field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.366" offset="11428864">It says that it should be an excellent container for pharmaceuticals like boric acid, Epsom salt, aspirin tablets and vitamins, all of course, usually in -- in glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.496" offset="11473377">And it concludes by stating, summing up information which will show -- and I quote, which will show that packer that is, "That conversion of the glass jar line to a saver locked can line is relatively simple and inexpensive."</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.075" offset="11547669">It seems to me that one cannot possibly fail to recognize the keen consciousness of competition as between these industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.928" offset="11595107">To complete the picture, perhaps I should take a moment to refer to a few exhibits in Hazel-Atlas pre-merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.482" offset="11625305">At the beginning of volume 4, starting at page 2821, are theories of several letters which came from field officers of Hazel-Atlas to the headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.492" offset="11689357">In 1953, there had been a general 7.75% price increase on glass containers and the letter at 2821, reports that some of the canners are -- two can companies are resisting this increase, as to food packers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.478" offset="11773262">And the writer says that these companies said that they would cut down on the use of glass as it would be too far out of line with the cost of their tin package, if this price increase were put fully into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.708" offset="11838255">The next exhibit in similar vain, shows the field man of Hazel-Atlas reporting, one of our syrup accounts is in sense to the price increase and said that any business that could be swung over to tin would be fully explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.538" offset="11917563">The next exhibit at 2824 reports, again, a letter from the field to the main office, that a group of merchants in the food packing line had grouped together as an association to try to get to the bottom of the recent price advance made by most of the glass companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.281" offset="11992482">They were all working along a certain line to try to get some of the glass companies to rescind as advanced or turn to some other kind of packaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.405" offset="12045040">Assuming as I do, that the Government's evidence which was all I emphasized, the District Court had before it when it undertook to dismiss this case that it required the conclusion that there was very significant competition between glass and can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.638" offset="12137932">There remains the question, and on this issue to the District Court found against the Government, there remains the question whether the disappearance of Hazel-Atlas says, an independent company may substantially impair that competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.318" offset="12204596">The District Court said, even assuming there's a line of commerce, I find no showing of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.683" offset="12238137">I've already mentioned that Hazel-Atlas was one of the pioneers of this industry, of the glass industry, and a company of very formidable size.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.938" offset="12279097">Continental Can of course, is one of the true giants with roughly a-third of the can market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.046" offset="12311594">Perhaps the most vital competition which bears upon these two oligopolistic industries is the cross-competition between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.979" offset="12359241">Let us suppose for a moment that the big three of each of these industries got together, that American Can and Anchor-Hocking say -- the National Can and Owens-Illinois, that they follow the pack of Continental Can and Hazel-Atlas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.209" offset="12440221">How vigorously would these two industries then seek to penetrate each others' markets and engage in price competition?</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.187" offset="12476165">Let me note only that three such mergers would represent 70% of the combined production of these two industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.164" offset="12516080">The single merger with which we deal here, results in an aggregation of more than 25% of their combined production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.129" offset="12563937">This merger obviously represents far more than a small start.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.778" offset="12602493">Only a few weeks ago of course, this Court dealt with a consolidation of the first and fourth largest banks in Fayette County, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.470" offset="12653275">It expressed the view that at least where two companies are major competitive factors in a relevant market, the elimination of competition as between them by itself, constitutes a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.565" offset="12741674">Now, I need notch the debate, the requirement of the Sherman Act under which the Government normally has a much heavier burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.767" offset="12786395">It is enough here, we think, to point out that we are dealing with much, much more important competition than was involved in the Lexington, Kentucky area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.081" offset="12839685">Competition between two of the major companies in a great national market and that the charge here is laid under the prophylactic provisions of the Clayton Act, on that we rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.448" offset="12933204">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.928" offset="12959117">This case does not, I believe, present any questions of law whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.086" offset="12987747">It's a pure, simple fact case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.685" offset="13018154">The Government -- the District Court decided the case and the appellee are all in agreement as to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.396" offset="13076982">The District Court, in his oral statement indicating his decision to dismiss the case, had this to say, record 1537, "The basic defect in the Government's case does not lie in its theories within the nature and quality of its proof."</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.109" offset="13183770">Many of the propositions of fact on which the Government relies, finds support only in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.598" offset="13217729">Others rest on most insubstantial and evanescent evidentiary foundations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.931" offset="13247091">Statements of counsel as to what the facts may be or inferences based on incomplete, yet not misleading statistics or mere glittering generalities cannot be substituted for evidence, cannot be substituted for proof, and they cannot furnish a basis for finding of facts necessary to sustain the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.494" offset="13377390">The Government insists that there's a question as to whether interindustry mergers come under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.679" offset="13422111">However, both the District Court and the appellee agreed that they do if the statutory tests are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.294" offset="13464534">The Government, however, is asking this Court to make new findings with respect to lines of commerce and with respect to the effects of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.051" offset="13527542">Prior to the acquisition here in question, Continental Can did not make glass containers or any other product that Hazel-Atlas Glass Company made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.591" offset="13589713">Hazel-Atlas on the other hand did not make anything that Continental made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.502" offset="13621373">Neither one was a supplier of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.117" offset="13639868">They served entirely different markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.803" offset="13654601">The record shows no instance of their meeting in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.162" offset="13676022">They were not in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.292" offset="13700577">Section 7 cases break quite naturally into two parts, delineation of a market and the examination of the effects of the merger in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.927" offset="13767032">With respect to the first question, this Court has many times given careful attention to the matter of delineating the market, some of these cases, Times-Picayune, cellophane, du Pont, General Motors, International Boxing, Brown Shoe, Philadelphia Bank, more recently, El Paso, and Lexington Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.594" offset="13885733">The market test in these cases has been expressed in several ways, but they're all essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.011" offset="13923453">What is the real market?</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.447" offset="13933171">How do products move in commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.699" offset="13946128">Who really competes with whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.298" offset="13960547">What are the realities of the marketplace?</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.295" offset="13984580">Du Pont, General Motors expressed the market test in terms of peculiar -- of peculiar characteristics and uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.343" offset="14028779">Brown Shoe expressed that in terms of reasonable interchangeability of use for cross-elasticity of demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.798" offset="14082591">All of these cases have recognized that the line must be drawn somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.341" offset="14116760">In a general way, all products and all services compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.075" offset="14151659">There are substitutes for all products, but the problem is to find out what is the real market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.848" offset="14198784">With respect to this second question in Section 7 cases, the effect in competition, it's clear that the test is the reasonable probability of anticompetitive effects, not mere possibility, not speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.308" offset="14284570">In the court below, the Government proposed 10 lines of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.645" offset="14317902">They were carefully defined to result of interrogatories, pretrial hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.034" offset="14355519">Some of these lines were interindustry lines, some were industry lines, many of them were fragmentation lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.961" offset="14411212">The Government called its witnesses to produce its evidence with respect to each of the proposed lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.876" offset="14446843">It called can manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.333" offset="14456665">It called representatives of principle glass container manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.284" offset="14480488">Except for some testimony relating to beer containers, the Can people in general said they knew nothing about glass and the glass people said they knew nothing about cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.991" offset="14539316">The Government called its experts, but they failed to support the proposition that cans and glass are in the same market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.416" offset="14589053">The evidence in this case is such that it is possible to use the indicia of markets referred to in Brown Shoe and to go right down the line as to what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.862" offset="14670869">The District Court did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.539" offset="14689573">The Brown Shoe case, having been decided after the judge below announced his oral decision to dismiss the complaint but before he filed his formal findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.291" offset="14764492">Indicia referred to industry and public recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.517" offset="14785390">The can industry and the glass container industry are separate and well-defined rather its peculiar characteristics and uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.153" offset="14823946">Cans and glass containers were made of different materials, have different physical characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.485" offset="14853308">Unique production facilities, can and glass container manufacturing equipment is not interchangeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.508" offset="14889357">The use or point of view is not possible to use a canning line designed to use one type of container to pack a product in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.276" offset="14948498">Distinct customers, there are different customers for the different types of containers.Distinct prices, glass containers, cans are priced separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.480" offset="15005341">The price of cans is determined primarily by the cost of tin plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.585" offset="15029687">The price of glass containers are determined primarily by the cost of labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.146" offset="15059989">Sensitivity to price changes, prices one type of containers except in the separate instance of beer perhaps that I will come to, are not changed in response of price movements of the other type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.192" offset="15128116">Specialized vendors, can company sell their own cans, glass company sell their glass, no jobbers handle both, no distributors handle both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.948" offset="15191124">The District Court made a most careful examination of the evidence produced by the Government and found three lines of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.375" offset="15244831">The can industry, the glass industry, and containers for beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.943" offset="15283179">These findings were made by applying the tests described by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.148" offset="15311914">The District Court made a most careful examination into the question of how products actually move in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.348" offset="15356740">The Government has said both in its brief and here today, the District Court failed to consider interindustry competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.114" offset="15399790">They say that his decision was based on the -- largely on the separate characteristics of the different containers is not so at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.591" offset="15453706">What the District Court did is exemplified in this treatment of containers for beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.792" offset="15486516">There are, of course, beer cans, there are beer bottles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.235" offset="15520266">The District Court examined the evidence relating for the two types of containers, found that they were in the same line of commerce because he said there were prima facie evidence of interchangeability and use in cross-elasticity of demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.900" offset="15638967">On this appeal, the Government argues for two lines of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.673" offset="15674075">The first of these is, all cans and all glass containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.445" offset="15701138">Here, the Government says that since they can both be used to hold things, they're in the same line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.444" offset="15741158">The Government calls this functional interchangeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.920" offset="15763101">And they would disregard everything having to do with actual usage including the evidence of their own expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.748" offset="15814405">The record doesn't support functional interchangeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.364" offset="15836871">Many products can be sold only in one container or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.625" offset="15861844">Many of them require different formulations for processing, depending on the container that's used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.768" offset="15902490">Liquor, example is always sold in glass containers.</text>
