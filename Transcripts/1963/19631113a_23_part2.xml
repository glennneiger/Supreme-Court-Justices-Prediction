            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. David J. Vann</label>
            <text syncTime="51.432" offset="310084">Well we have, one of the Alabama Constitution, a procedure of executive amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.241" offset="337356">The executive can veto a bill and propose an amendment to the bill which if accepted by the legislature would avoid his veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.410" offset="382077">And we asked the Governor to amend the Crawford-Webb Bill to provide for proper reapportionment and submit it back to the legislature with an executive amendment, the Governor refused to do so.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="82.797" offset="435576">So this provision means in effect that the Governor has a substantial amount of potential legislative power, is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Vann</label>
            <text syncTime="90.999" offset="468386">Yes, but the Governor's veto in Alabama can be overwritten by a simple majority, so it's not as effective a veto as you have in some other States and in federal veto.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.604" offset="534841">And the -- when you have a position, as we were in Justice Stewart, where in the State Senate, with 20% of the people, we only had -- we had less than 3% of the representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.124" offset="592938">We couldn't -- we -- although we were in near majority status with others counties affected, we couldn't even effectively use those legislative devices used to protect minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.690" offset="639122">We don't have enough power to even use minority protection in the State Senate (Inaudible), for example the filibuster.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Vann</label>
            <text syncTime="160.682" offset="747165">In our judgment, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.807" offset="755628">And that is one of the -- I pointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.504" offset="762420">That I would like to cover in a very short time that I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.538" offset="782587">One, I like to say why, why we feel additional relief is needed and we have asked in effect for alternatively for a direction to the District Court to -- to provide at least substantially population reinforcement in the State Senate or we've asked for a declaration from the Court, the declaration -- well either remediate, we think might result in a legislative result before the District Court could handle it, it would give the District Court another opportunity if the legislature, again, failed to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.478" offset="946322">Now, we have this situation, the Senate has provided for in the -- in the order below.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.469" offset="982267">It does not even eliminate the most egregious discrimination in the -- in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.097" offset="1024794">In other words, the -- the fact that our county with 20% of the people has only one Senator means that we have one-seventh of the voice, that our population would entitle us to in the State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.494" offset="1082368">The senate district of Bibb and Perry has 20 times the voice of my county, Mobile County which Mr. McConnell comes here, only has a third of the voice to this population would entitle to it, and Bibb and Perry County have ten times the voice of Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.787" offset="1167527">Now, this produces a very serious problem and it has very mediate and very practical results.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.167" offset="1205039">A member of a legislature is more than a person to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.271" offset="1229490">A member of the State Senate along his own committees, he's Chairman of Committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.249" offset="1257388">He has powers beyond his vote in the channeling of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.824" offset="1275674">The existence of representation affects your areas' relationship with the State Executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.271" offset="1313499">In our county, may it please the Court, has been generally regarded by the State as the pool from which the taxes should come and the place that which very little of the money should return.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.294" offset="1361565">This -- we've had state aid to small counties without the consent of the payer for that aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.251" offset="1401375">Now, coming to the point, and I think the crucial point is that, pointed out by Attorney General Richmond Flowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.518" offset="1430424">The crucial point that I think has cost the legislature to be at loggerheads, it was a crucial point that I think disturbed the District Court below was the provision of Section 200 of the State -- of the State Constitution which says, “No county shall be divided between two districts, and no district shall be made up of more than two counties not contiguous to each other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="358.630" offset="1538884">Now, the first line there, “No county shall be divided between two districts,” is the point that has troubled people.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.749" offset="1567410">Now, the appellants get around there by simply changing the language when they quote the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.364" offset="1597816">In their brief, at page 15 and 18, they simply changed the word between to into and this -- this was the way they argued it this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.234" offset="1641284">The assuming of what that word between means by changing it to into.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.170" offset="1661032">The Solicitor General in his brief merely tasked this vital point of, by assuming in his statement of facts that this means “into” instead of between.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.038" offset="1708575">Solicitor General, in his brief sights and treats this in its footnote on page 6 by saying that this has been interpreted by apportionment under the 1901 constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.005" offset="1780464">Well, in the first place, until the Crawford-Webb Bill was passed, there had never been an apportionment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.689" offset="1807109">You are cited to code provisions in the 1940 Code which appear to be a legislative apportionment of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.123" offset="1844935">Well now, the Legislature of Alabama reapportioned itself almost faithfully, every ten years, from 1920 through 1892.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.065" offset="1880670">And the code, in existence in 1901, had a code section in it which set out the latest apportionment under the 1892 Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.471" offset="1926332">When the code was revised in 1903 and again in 1923, the Code Committee simply wrote the constitutional provisions in instead of adding inaccurate code section which of course no longer apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.534" offset="1982548">The only semblance of -- of anything is the incorporation into the Code of the Constitution itself by a Code Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.447" offset="2010133">There's never been a legislative act to intervene it.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.635" offset="2022985">The question has never been ruled on by the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.540" offset="2042525">That was another thing we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.823" offset="2047645">We asked the Governor and we had to right to ask for advisory opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.232" offset="2061333">We asked him to submit this question to the Alabama Supreme Court which he refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.417" offset="2086097">Because this has been the point, when you have a group of people who held legislative power, they hold it in a minority basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.883" offset="2123922">They're being asked to vote themselves out of power or to reduce their power.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.385" offset="2145970">They don't want to give away anymore power than they have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.376" offset="2161852">And I think the Legislature of Alabama, I know many members, is basically a fair-minded body.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.235" offset="2185362">I think if they knew what the standard was, we'd have an excellent chance of getting a proper bill from the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.218" offset="2213261">But as long as this point is in doubt and we attempt to be to get it ruled-on on the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.684" offset="2239175">As long as this point is in doubt, I think it's almost impossible to get relief from the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.242" offset="2265401">And therefore, I think that it is a vital importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.733" offset="2275328">Now, let's --</text>

            <text syncTime="543.982" offset="2280344">Alright, that's what I want to tell you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.572" offset="2290688">The Constitution in five or six places including this provision in 284 which says, “Population shall not be removed by constitutional amendment” which is a strong -- a statement as the constitutional convention could have made, repeatedly, states that population is the standard, is their goal and is their guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.826" offset="2383684">Now, interpreting the instrument within its four corners as -- in accordance with Alabama practice and the cases which we have cited in our brief to you, this provision would be entitled -- I mean, would be interpreted as being in line with that statement and that would make it a provision which is a provision against gerrymandering which is very reasonable that if you've got a group of a republican voters or -- or group of pink people or blue people or green people, you can't divide them up and tack them on to the additional counties by dividing a county into fragments.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.513" offset="2542404">Now, this provision originally came into the Constitution of Alabama in substance in the original constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.690" offset="2575109">And there was never any discussion of it and on the floor of any subsequent constitutional convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.669" offset="2603112">The language got changed several times in redrafting but it's been there from the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.056" offset="2624637">Now, as it was originally worded in the Constitution of 1819 it said, “When a senatorial district shall be composed of two or more counties, no county shall be divided in forming a district.”</text>
            <text syncTime="645.228" offset="2685346">Which is exactly the interpretation which we say the Court should be -- should place upon it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.362" offset="2705826">Now, this is an interpretation within the framework entirely of Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.518" offset="2730486">Now, we feel that in dealing with an historic document of people such as the Constitution of Alabama and it is one of those more ancient in its origins of those -- of the 50 states that the court should deal with them most candidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.556" offset="2818570">But we believe this, we believe that population is the standard of the Fourteenth Amendment and we believe the Court should place an interpretation upon our State Constitution, so as to make that Constitution or have -- as to prevent the Constitution from reaching a constitutional issue that would strike its provision down unnecessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.303" offset="2901640">Or reading it, this rule of construction is applied that you would -- the Court would still adapt our interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.708" offset="2947197">Well, I believe it was first changed in the period during the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.482" offset="2978335">We had quite a series of constitutional conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.970" offset="2992232">We had one right at the first to Civil War where they wrote succession into the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.509" offset="3018459">Then we had one under the Military Government at the end of the Civil War where they wrote of abolition of slavery into the State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.017" offset="3064435">And this was submitted, that voted the people and it didn't pass but Military Governor certified it did and they had a bunch of confusion about that, so they came back the next year, I think and had another constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.266" offset="3117411">And during this time, this thing does not change.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.495" offset="3134339">Then following the last carpetbagger constitution, if you pardon me, is what we call it in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.835" offset="3167775">The Court after the Tilden election had another convention and I might say that no one who attended any of the previous conventions was at the Constitution of 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.317" offset="3217617">And wrote another constitution and it was at that time, with no discussion that this change was made and it was incorporated without a comment in the constitution of 1801.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.453" offset="3250218">Now, -- I mean 1901, I have to say this, that no county has ever had two senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.539" offset="3274564">But at no time since 1901, has the failure to give a county two senators, produced serious ratios.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.656" offset="3315001">There were times when someone might be entitled to two, but 1901 was the time of the industrialization of Jefferson County.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.545" offset="3338616">Our city, Birmingham did not exist at the time of the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.316" offset="3353663">We had this massive vote in the 1890s -- and then really massive after 1901.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.637" offset="3386995">So the problem did not attain its serious proportions until after 1901.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.337" offset="5637705">We, as appellants, who are also intervene as plaintiffs in the action below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.740" offset="5663305">We have brought this appeal for the simple and sole purpose are they -- as we stated in our brief of what the lower court did not say, rather than what it did say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.068" offset="5712624">It may have been animated and perhaps implicit on some of these things such as the question of dividing a county to give more equality of representation of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.505" offset="5762466">But we feel that the Court, this Court, should set out guidelines for either the lower court or the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.673" offset="5799037">We believe, and I think the appearance here of the Attorney General animates that whatever the court gives as a minimum apportionment will be the maximum apportionment that you receive in the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.765" offset="5863508">We believe that it needs guidelines and standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.117" offset="5880853">Now, we've been here for two days talking on this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.149" offset="5892974">Many interesting questions have a risk and I would like to take the brief time that it's been allotted to this appellant to perhaps answer some of those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.571" offset="5934665">First, we are here as individual citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.532" offset="5950548">I do not claim to represent an urban area, a certain occupation within there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.588" offset="5990776">I am second a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.612" offset="5998822">Someone else may be first, a citizen and second a banker, but what we are talking about here is protection of individual, their civil private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.633" offset="6038946">We think there's a difference between apportionment and between the selection of the unit to be represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.964" offset="6068203">We believe and I believe as Mr. Justice Brandeis has said that one of the strength and advantages of our system was that we had 50 laboratories in which various political theories could be tracked and we think that should be strengthen and at no restriction should be placed on the individual state working out their own form of government, but within constitutional standards and limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.146" offset="6173006">You may have experimentation, I believe it was Mr. Justice Stewart asked this yesterday, experimentation in the unit of representation, but once that unit is determined, there can be no experimentation in the quality of representation from that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.984" offset="6236327">I believe it was Mr. Justice Stewart did ask yesterday about a six House Legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.509" offset="6278437">We are asking for equality in the governmental process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.204" offset="6509255">I would have to look at the method of selection and the voice that that counsel has because it will take -- in a Gray versus Sanders, where you say it's a unit wide election, it's election of statewide official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.589" offset="6586786">You say that the vote must count equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.533" offset="6594518">Let's just say that they had been nothing but direct counting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.814" offset="6611655">Then you -- you remove at one process and you have a counting of vote and then you have a second counting in which the first votes are changed into a new ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.697" offset="6659197">Now, I think you could apply that to your counsel that you're speaking of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.409" offset="6678006">If the Governor say, who was elected directly by everyone, statewide vote, should select half of those counsel numbers and the other half were hereditary, then that counsel would not be constitutional because the citizen who had an equal voice in the selection of the Governor was only had an equal voice in the selection of half of the numbers of that counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.856" offset="6783854">The other half he had no participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.335" offset="6793780">Now, our point here and so point on appeal is that we think that population must be the initial controlling (Inaudible) and that that must be in every state to the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.798" offset="6847592">If it's unicameral, you satisfied it if you have equal voice and one house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.345" offset="6865774">If it's bicameral such as it is in Alabama, there must be equality in each house because both houses are necessary to enact laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.021" offset="6908510">If we have equal voice and only one house and no voice, and your question yesterday of home rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.496" offset="6934424">If you had home rule for Mobile County that I represent here, if they were just one right such as congressional redistrict which will face this Court in the next few days, that is done by the State Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.725" offset="6991266">We would be deprived in Mobile County of our equality and the legislative process, if simply because we had home rule on everything but congressional districting did not have an equal voice and the legislature in the districting of the state for congressional election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.253" offset="7157405">Now, the other appellants are here principally because of the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.289" offset="7169526">We concur on what they say in the Senate but we also do not believe that the apportionment of the State -- of the House of Representatives in Alabama, allowing one representative per county first, will give us equality and the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.352" offset="7241832">They figure that I think it may be a conflict but it's roughly a little better than 40% which is about what New York is arguing here on this but that's accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.577" offset="7282688">The lower court did comply without constitutional provisions and we say that it's not necessarily gross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.007" offset="7312468">We say you start with population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.980" offset="7324275">Now, we recognize and -- and without disagreement Mr. Justice Stewart, it may not be eighth-grade arithmetic on the first part, but I believe that eighth-grade arithmetic will determine the ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.813" offset="7375684">Now, which ratio and where you stop, we recognize that this point and Mr. Justice Goldberg has raised, the size of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.683" offset="7407135">If in Alabama you take 106, we have 3,200,000 people, you divide it, you get a ratio of about 30,000 per representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.348" offset="7445797">Now, we recognize that they will have to be administrative deviation from an exact 30,800 per representative and that there is leeway there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.034" offset="7496579">But we won't go so far to say that that leeway must be gross before the court will strike it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.246" offset="7521343">You will look it why the leeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.571" offset="7530642">And if it simply to keep one precinct from one county, I mean taken out of the county and put in another to equalize the legislature -- the district, you may say that that's alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.266" offset="7573483">But it doesn't have to become what in the past we have termed gross by the court act, the question of proportional voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.313" offset="7613607">We'd feel that the State could establish constitutionally proportional voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.081" offset="7636699">We feel that they could establish three a house legislature, one on geography, one on occupation, one on something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.469" offset="7670241">But in each house where there's proportional also, it would have to be that each voter or each citizen in the State, would have to have equality in the representative in each house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.739" offset="7723321">You mentioned management and labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.830" offset="7731681">If you could divide the State of Alabama into two groups, in which management was two-third and labor was one-third, you can have a house made up of occupations but two-thirds would have to be elected by management and one-third by the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.588" offset="8394773">Federal, it's paper number 39, I believe it is that he quote, “Does not quote an early a paragraph in there relative to equal representation, but that is -- our position is that you can experiment on the different forms but there can be no experimentation in which equality is deluded or taken away that within the governmental process.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.235" offset="9177297">Now, we concur in the other appellant's argument of the interpretation that could be given to the Senate provision which we think would square that without declaring unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.751" offset="9227452">But in a house where you have a provision that each county must have at least one representative then we maintain, and as Attorney General pointed out, the court gave appellate a method we think is fair, the method of equal proportions in alighting, the representative -- the House of Representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.697" offset="9299132">But even then, Houston County had one representative of 50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.895" offset="9319926">Coosa County with only 10,000 populations has one representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.369" offset="9333823">That's the worse five to one ratio even with what we say is a fair method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.600" offset="9354825">But once you start by giving 67 representatives to the existing 67 county in one each, then you make it impossible to give equality of representation in remaining seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.697" offset="9407175">Now, we also have pointed out in our brief effect that the legislature can achieve the 67-Senator Amendment simply by legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.219" offset="9449284">The Constitution provides an upper limit on the size of the house but no lower limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.914" offset="9472063">They could provide, therefore, a house of 67 numbers in which then each county would be entitled to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.385" offset="9501947">You would end up with a 67 number house in which the largest would have a population of 634,000, the smallest count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.705" offset="9539250">Now, we believe that the constitutional convention in 1901 in Alabama, if you look at the proceedings and we've cited them in a footnote in our brief at pages to constitutional convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.658" offset="9591077">If you look at the provisions themselves throughout the delegates to that Convention recognized that fairness of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.875" offset="9635903">Every provision even down to the formation of new counties, they have a provision in there that no county could be formed unless it had enough people in the new county to the ratio of population to give it one representative or it left the old county or counties from which he was taken with a ratio of representation and tying it into one, so that they even thought about this thing have taken in new counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.303" offset="9749588">They couldn't delude to vote unless that new county came in with a population sufficient to entitle it to at least one representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.092" offset="9784801">But to your question Chief Justice, we do not believe that on the house that the -- in conformity with the provision of Alabama Constitution would meet the constitutional standards of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.132" offset="9844882">Now we, as I said, asked the lower court to declare this in it's -- in our original petition to declare these guidelines regardless, as the Attorney General has pointed out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.419" offset="9910084">There is -- well, as we've seen in -- in the State of Alabama in this brief here, in his brief has pointed out that one session of legislature is going back with this reapportion legislation that didn't get anywhere with a further reapportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.900" offset="9976017">Now, we believe in and not only is full of action necessary and we do recognize that including paragraph of the Court, if the Court and in -- by the strong language as -- as it could stated that it was going to do something if the legislature did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.807" offset="10031606">But we do believe that either the lower court on the legislature needs a guideline, a criteria, a standard by which to measure what they do and what they must do in order to conform to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.877" offset="10103912">We think that the wording as contained in this Section of Alabama Constitution, about constitutional amendment in which they wrote in that population shall be the basis of representation and that it cannot be changed by constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.665" offset="10171099">In there, it says “as nearly as maybe” and we think that although we're argue in numbers but numbers is a safe guide here for determining of whether or not we meet that standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.512" offset="10626466">But regardless of how you do it, you've still got to end up when the representative gets there, he must represent either an equal number or each person must have an equal share of representative of either way you want to put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.832" offset="10679756">Now, this proportion of voting that you mentioned that was proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.026" offset="10696474">The Court asked amicus brief in this -- on proportional voting in the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.512" offset="10718417">We opposed it for the simple reason that you ask about committee assignments, another, the filibuster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.615" offset="10742868">There are many ways but the same token, we think that it would be unfair if you gave Jackson County and Mobile County the proper number of representatives and Senators then after they've got that, told them they had to vote by county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.491" offset="10798352">Supposed we've got seven then you said, “Alright now, you can go to where you're committed, you can filibuster but when it comes to voting, we're going to have a unit room,” which we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.022" offset="10836490">And -- and that's a -- a perfect illustration of what we say is -- is a denial of -- of equality in the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.597" offset="10866792">But we think that there has to be in both houses and although we do not right to argue that our constitutional provision violates the Fourteenth Amendment, we do believe that there is not any principle that can apply in the State of Alabama and we don't have near the urban characteristics in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.471" offset="10946309">It's pointed out in the Solicitor General's brief in non-largest counties here in Alabama have just about 50% of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.229" offset="10977343">And those nine are from one any State of the other, and do not necessarily represent common interest or common views and would probably not act together or would rarely act together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.104" offset="11024781">But we believe that the present constitutional provision with regard to House of Representative in Alabama does not meet the standard required by the Fourteenth Amendment and that we believe that either this Court should so declare by the lower court in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.782" offset="11099491">Now, we -- my particular appellants recommend a solution to that, it's an experimentation in the type of unit but it ends up with equality of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.179" offset="11149124">It maybe a little difficult to administer, but we think there's even a way that you can conform to the Alabama requirements and give equality in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.704" offset="11191233">But we say -- what we ask here is that this Court set out the standard and the guidelines for either the legislature or the lower court to follow an apportionment but that basic to it must be -- and this was a thing that worked when they cited Fortson, a Georgia case and even show diverse is higher and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.518" offset="11282453">A question in the court's man has to whether or not both houses or the bicameral legislature had to be apportioned to give equality of representation in each house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.087" offset="11324771">And it was that type of language that concerned by the lower court was the principle reason what appeared here because we believe that you do not satisfy any bicameral legislature unless you have equality of representation in both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.305" offset="11385584">Now, we take it from Gray versus Sanders that starts out with the idea of “one man one vote in a statewide" but we do not believe that simply by raising it to another level, to a representative that you can dilute that equality that you started with in the governmental process, here the legislative process, deluded by passing it through something that makes you come out with a different ratio or a different percentage at the next level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.958" offset="11500210">Just as a county unit after all, suppose they had elected people statewide just, like the electors on the federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.859" offset="11523824">Those electors then in Georgia would have had a certain number of votes based on the country units.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.791" offset="11551514">We would have -- the Georgia voter would have had equality in selecting elector but that equality in the final analysis would have been taken away.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.246" offset="14201375">But after listening to what has been said here about the Alabama understanding an Alabama practice, I'm bound to say that that raises some question in my mind as to whether that is the State's own interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.150" offset="14252993">That was the point I was trying to make to bring it out very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.607" offset="14266786">The other point on which I think I was guilty of some misunderstanding is in no statements in which I said that it was questionable whether the Crawford-Webb Act had become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.456" offset="14322270">Upon rethinking that, it seems to me that it is quite clear that it would become effective as of the 1966 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.498" offset="14330420">And that the statement said, it say that this was intended to take effect only if the constitutional amendment were voted down are inconsistent with the words of the Crawford-Webb Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.068" offset="14396667">It said it shall effect as of the 1966 election was known ifs, ands, and buts, so that the constitutional amendment, would I take at least out of the conditions subsequent rather than its defeat thing, a condition proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.815" offset="14455704">I don't think the use of matter either of them, matters to go to the essence but I did want to beguile you of misleading the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.402" offset="14482035">Alright, now I do come to the points that we wanted to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.154" offset="14501052">Our position as stated in the brief is that the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.702" offset="14531250">There are number of issues in the case, three apportionments that I think it all falls most easily into place, if we take up the questions in the same sequence that they came before the District Court, what they are facing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.029" offset="14588510">And I shall attempt to relate each of those issues to the basic thesis that I sought to expand yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.074" offset="14620693">But the first question in the District Court was rather the apportionment in effect in Alabama then, the 1901 apportionment violated the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.515" offset="14670430">It's quite blind I think and to defeat it is hardly argued that that apportionment violated the Equal Protection Clause under the second principle that I sought to state yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.134" offset="14716928">In other words, that it discriminates between people, they stand equally -- unequally before the election law without any rhyme or reason, without any justification before the inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.776" offset="14771472">And under Baker and Carr, the Court has power to adjudicate that would we should think without any question hold that that apportionment is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.181" offset="14825075">We've given the evidence, so it's a crazy quilt in our brief I see no need to take the time to give the Court a message that was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.142" offset="14864990">The question then arose but remedy should the District Court direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.363" offset="14905846">The legislature had already considered this question by raised to the fact that the District Court before it made a firm adjudication had indicated its views and an opinion, and the legislature had done three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.310" offset="14973659">First, it had provided no rule for the November, 1962 election and there was a legislature to be elected then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.561" offset="15018590">It did pass a law indicating that if the court should direct an apportionment and then the state election would be conducted in accordance with that apportionment, which in effect indicated that if a State was prepared to fit with what the Court might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.931" offset="15096121">At second, the legislature put up to the people, the so-called 67-Senator Amendment to be voted in November, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.486" offset="15138335">And third, it enacted the Crawford-Webb Act that I referred to early.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.643" offset="15162995">That would seem to me that at this point, the District Court was required to consider the 67-Senator Amendment not as an effective provision because it hadn't been ratified by the people and I supposed ordinarily, a court wouldn't passed on -- the federal court, it wouldn't passed on the constitutionality of something that hadn't become effective law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.999" offset="15260379">But here, the Court was under an obligation to shape any decree it might entered as closely to the desires of the people of Alabama as expressed through their public arguments as it was able at the -- the prime rating if I may use that expression that the legislature, the best desirable in Alabama, subject to criticism as it might be as unrepresentative had indicated that the apportionment in the 67-Senator Amendment was the one that it thought was most desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.048" offset="15400605">And if that did not infringe on the plaintiff's constitutional rights, then I would think that it would have been an error of law for the District Court not to incorporated that in its decree or at least to permit the election to have been conducted in accordance with that apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.905" offset="15468001">So the court was obliged to consider whether the 67-Senator Amendment would infringe on the plaintiff's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.877" offset="15499870">It was obliged to consider the Crawford-Webb Act for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.570" offset="15518678">Now of course, the 1962 election has been held that the Crawford-Webb Act is still in a reality with respect to the 1966 election and therefore, would have to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.557" offset="15566639">So I think that both of those apportionments are before the Court for properly -- for consideration just as if they were effective law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.172" offset="15621078">The 67-Senator Amendment, we say is invalid because it makes classifications or differentiations that within the usual equal protection standards are arbitrary and capricious, point out that something maybe arbitrary or capricious for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.363" offset="15713865">They correspond to the second, third and fourth to the proposition as I outlined yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.626" offset="15742913">Something maybe arbitrary and capricious because there was no intelligible foundation to just if -- through days had some other system like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.689" offset="15783142">That's not applicable to the 67-Senator Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.660" offset="15799024">It does have a rule both with the respect to the Senate and with respect to the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.804" offset="15831625">The rule in the Senate you'll recall is one from each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.306" offset="15845627">The rule in the House is one from each county and then the rest according to population.</text>

            <text syncTime="3979.183" offset="16021170">I take it that something maybe arbitrary precious even though intelligible, in the sense that the line that it draws, the differentiation, has no relation to any -- no -- no rational relationship to any permissible legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.034" offset="16116569">But that -- that is true in Brown against Board of Education or it's true in any number of cases that there is an intelligible differentiation of pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.917" offset="16160037">And I say that if there is a pattern violates -- does not violate the crazy quilt doctrine, still it is an irrational differentiation if the criteria bear no rational relationship to a permissible legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.797" offset="16235583">Now, we said that the New York apportionment of the Senate bore no rational relationship when you examine it closely to any permissible legislative purpose because the purposes that would claim for it keeping the size of the county small, giving people access to their representatives and so forth, were purposes that it had to tendency to accomplish when you examined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.729" offset="16343312">The county -- the districts were getting bigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.333" offset="16353761">What it did was create a class society in a political sense that it happened to say that one class of people should have more votes than another, and that was its only function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.004" offset="16396392">And that we say is a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.523" offset="16414469">It is not related to any permissible legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.478" offset="16430352">Now, the 67-Senator Amendment is not bad on this ground Mr. Justice, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.143" offset="16452921">It is -- it has a rational tendency to do two things.</text>

            <text syncTime="4214.388" offset="16961996">And then an effort to incorporate that in the language suitable to the apportionment problems, we suggested as our fourth proposition that the Equal Protection Clause is violated by an apportionment which subordinates the principles of popular representation in majority of rule to other permissible objectives of apportionment to such a degree as to create gross in equalities, in per capita representation and give control of the legislature to representatives chosen by very small minorities of the people.</text>

            <text syncTime="4634.140" offset="18640938">Suppose that in New York, the people of Erie County, which is one in Buffalo, one of the big counties, were given only one representative and only one senator, and the rest of the State was apportioned according to population.</text>

            <text syncTime="4677.165" offset="18813032">So in the New York case, if you examine it closely, that we suggest this in our brief, we didn't do it as a good job as within I have but if you examine it closely, you'll see that the discrimination between the county is over 6% or 350th as the Deputy and Attorney General insist that we must say instead of 6%, does not tend to accomplish any of the purposes that keeping county small.</text>

            <text syncTime="5759.136" offset="23140895">And for that reason, we say that then we'd have a reapportioned legislature that would meet the requirement of the test that has been laid down by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5794.822" offset="23283733">I don't think the Legislature of Alabama is addressed by the Attorney General's statement and the other attorneys with the appellate that the Legislature of Alabama would ever allow that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.708" offset="23335246">I think that they would pass some type of reapportionment bill that would reapportion the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.682" offset="23363145">But to place what these gentlemen wants, attorneys for the appellate on the basis that they want re-approval is strictly have in both houses on this population basis then we are going to have a big majority of the State of Alabama that is not going to have any representation but is going to be under the thumb of the dense areas where the population has grew because of industrial area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5848.275" offset="23497519">And we submit that it's just as bad to have a people living under those conditions as is to be having a minority of ruling a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.699" offset="23547152">We believe that the Constitution of Alabama has set a system of checks and balance and it stated how it should be in it and if the constitution in providing for representation in the House of Legislature is reasonable, rational and can be bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.379" offset="23629908">We respectfully submit to this Court that this case should be reversed and the opinion of the District Court.</text>
