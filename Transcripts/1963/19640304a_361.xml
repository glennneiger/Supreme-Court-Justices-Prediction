            <label>Mr. Paul Burks</label>
            <text syncTime="12.099" offset="151803">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, counsel for respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.353" offset="184822">This case is here for a review of a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which held that support allowance payments to a decedent's widow did not qualify for the marital deduction under the estate tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.369" offset="268831">The Revenue Act of 1916 which was the beginning of the modern estate tax law contained a provision allowing a deduction and computing the net estate for amounts paid to those dependants upon the decedent during the administration of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.296" offset="356603">The wording was slightly changed in the Revenue Act of 1918, but it thereafter remained the same until that deduction ceased to be allowed as a standard deduction by the Revenue Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.279" offset="432462">It appeared in the 1939 Internal Revenue Code as Section 812 (b) (5) and it provided as I recall it that should be allowed as a deduction for amounts reasonably required and actually expended for the support during the administration of the estate of those dependant upon the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.602" offset="549804">The Revenue Act of 1948 by Section 811 (e) introduced the marital deduction concept into the federal estate tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.591" offset="625768">The 1948 Revenue Act did not repeal Section 812 (b) and from then until 1950, that deduction for support payments continued to be allowed in addition to the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.601" offset="709778">During that two year period, it was possible to channel more than half of a decedent's estate to his or her surviving spouse without payment of the estate tax because the support payments under Section 812 (b) were 100% deductible and the marital deduction was limited to 50% of the decedent's adjusted gross estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.853" offset="858781">Now, Section 812 (b) payments -- 812 (b) (5) payments were deducted in computing the adjusted gross estate, but because Section 812 (b) (5) payments were 100% deductible and the marital deduction was limited to 50% of the adjusted gross estate, it was nevertheless possible to channel more than half the decedent's property to his/her surviving spouse free of estate tax and in many estates that made the difference between the payment of estate tax and no payment of estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.919" offset="1023039">Congress acted quickly and in 1950, 812 (b) (5) was eliminated as a standard deduction, but at that time, Congress said, amounts heretofore allowed under the marital deduction provision will nevertheless be allowed – Congress said that amounts previously we allowed under 812 (b) (5) would be allowed under the marital deduction provisions subject to the conditions and limitations of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.741" offset="1178311">Now the purpose of the marital deduction of course was to equalize the state tax treatment between residents of Common Law and Community Property Estates and the substantive conditions and limitations of the marital deduction provisions were the condition that the property be included in the decedent's taxable estate, the condition that it go to the surviving spouse in such a manner as to be taxed in the estate of the surviving spouse if not consumed and the limitation that the total amount allowed under the marital deduction provision not exceed 50% of the decedent's adjusted gross estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.008" offset="1511424">I said that the property had to go to the surviving spouse in such a way as to be taxed in the surviving spouse's estate and I believe that, that was the reason for the terminable interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.428" offset="1585089">Section 812 (b) (1) (2) I believe it is, is entitled life estates or other terminable interests and that I believe was designed to prevent an interest such as a life estate from qualifying for the marital deduction because it then would not be taxed in the estate of the surviving spouse.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Burks</label>
            <text syncTime="428.900" offset="1818937">Right, I think that applies to dower interest and other interest of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.768" offset="1870451">Now, if the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the courts had given substantial effect or really any effect to what Congress said in 1950 when 812 (b) (5) was eliminated as a standard deduction, the equality of tax treatment as between taxpayers and separate property and community property estates would have been more nearly achieved but as it turned out very few support payments have been allowed under the marital deduction provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.693" offset="2034186">The first argument of The Commissioner of Internal Revenue was that they weren't passing interest within the meaning of Section 812 (b), but it is well settled at this time both by court decision and by the regulations of the commissioner that support payments are considered to be passing interest within the Federal Estate Tax Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.633" offset="2133870">The objection that is raised now to the allowance of support payments under the marital deduction provisions is that they are terminable and that concept finds its greatest expression I believe in the Ninth Circuit and a decision entitled estate of CUNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.148" offset="2211924">Now the basis of that decision is that because it can't be known at the instant of the decedent's death whether or not the surviving spouse will get any family allowance that it's a terminable interest, they say that the property are the assets of the estate and not the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.586" offset="2321742">And for that reason they disallowed in the estate of CUNA periodic support payments as a deduction under the marital deduction provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.011" offset="2491434">That's right, and normally the discretion of the probate judge under Section 812 (b) (5) determined what was reasonably required and actually expanded, if the surviving spouse died, the payments might stop and then the deduction would be limited to what was actually paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.947" offset="2591117">Now the courts retreated somewhat from that rule in the Fifth and the Eighth Circuits in particular, and through decisions United States against First National Bank of Augusta, and in the E. O. Bookwalter case in the Eighth Circuit and they have held that lump sum support allowance payments will qualify for the marital deduction because the award when made best indefeasibly in widow or her estate, and should therefore be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.896" offset="2738970">Now in the opinion of petitioner that rule does not go far enough, but at least most of the courts in the country at this time including the Tax Court and through decisions in which the commissioner has acquiesced, recognized the lump sum support payments will qualify for the marital deduction if they vested indefeasibly in the surviving spouse on the date of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.807" offset="2850565">Now one ground petitioner's – excuse me petition to this Court is that we have the lump sum allowance.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.421" offset="3741027">It's the basis upon which all of the courts have disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.744" offset="3762343">And I think in any estate, you have to look at what a decedent owns and what he owes as of the date of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.557" offset="3797556">If a man leaves his widow 1/3rd of his net distributable estate, it isn't known when he dies whether she is going to get anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.266" offset="3836426">The claims of creditors and other things that might happen and the estate might entirely destroy, her right to that one third of the distributable net estate, but when the marital deduction is computed, that one third concept is related back to the date of death and some courts have been honest enough to say, that's what they are doing when they allow lump sum awards for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.934" offset="3947081">Now the Fifth Circuit in United States National Bank, the Bank of Augusta case, US against the First National Bank of Augusta, said they would look at the date of the order, but in determining the whole concept of this payment, they necessarily had to look at the date of death to determine the gross estate, and to do other things in that estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.869" offset="4054810">And the Sixth Circuit, in Dourdy, cited with approval in respondent's brief, the widow had a dower right.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.154" offset="4095979">She renounced under her husband's will and said I want to take under the intestacy laws, she had a dower right, which was a terminable interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.829" offset="4138715">Over 13 months after the decedent's death, she elected to convert that dower right into cash under Kentucky Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.709" offset="4170167">The courts said they would relate that elected back to the date of death and that I think what it should be done in all support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.037" offset="4219486">In the Fifth Circuit case, United States against the First National Bank of Augusta, the award was not of cash, it was 59,000 in bonds, negotiable securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.867" offset="4270791">The Court there held that the date of the order was controlling, but they had to go back to the date of death for some purposes and whether that widow had petitioned twice instead of once and she had gotten $30,000 worth of bonds on two separate occasions, but what if she had petitioned 15 times, and gotten $4000 worth of bonds on each occasion, it would be the date of the order and when you have one order that gives monthly right fruition as each month goes by, shouldn't that be treated the same as though it were a over lump sum award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.252" offset="4416345">When the right rests, it all relates back to the date of death, the lump sum award cases necessarily have to relate the payment back to the date of death, but that relation back shouldn't be limited to lump sum awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.262" offset="4492413">It's paid out of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.484" offset="4501295">If it's paid in such form, if it's paid in life estate, I don't think it should qualify.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.332" offset="5192704">Yeah, it may be that the martial deduction provision highlighted a possibility of distortion that had existed before, but as I say, up until 1948, our state tax laws had no provision for a marital deduction and the reason, as everyone agrees, is that in order to equalize the burden between the community property states and the common law states where in the community property estates, the wife is considered as owning half of the property all along and that half of the property wasn't included in the husband's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.952" offset="5347140">For a while, there was an attempt from that 42 to 48 to reverse a situation and try and disregard property law in the community property states and say that the wife's part still had to go through her husband's estate, or didn't under local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.626" offset="5417880">That didn't work and then Congress was faced with other alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.261" offset="5432404">Now there were lots of things that Congress could have done to meet this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.869" offset="5446823">They could have done like credits against tax, different kinds of allowances, only special kinds of widows allowances, a whole field was open to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.446" offset="5481200">And what they picked was a very specialized marital deduction provision and you don't have any natural right to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.040" offset="5507532">You either come within what Congress just specified as a marital deduction, or there is no marital deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.038" offset="5751515">But when they set up the marital deduction provision, there were two problems with which they could legitimately be concerned in trying to equalize community property and common law estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.253" offset="5792371">The first was that in -- if you give life estate to the wife with remainder to your children, that's something that a man in a community property estate can't do because wife already has a full title to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.058" offset="5847646">And furthermore, that life estate and the wife as we have discussed earlier is not going to be part of her estate, being incumbent, we can presume that it'll be consumed and so therefore, it won't be in her estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.759" offset="5902399">But there's another problem and which is also to be considered that in a community property estate, the husband can't put any other strings on this property going to wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.539" offset="5945553">He can't wait and see whether she is going to survive two months, six months, a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.765" offset="5962480">He can't wait and see whether she remarries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.697" offset="5974183">So he can't put any conditions on at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.827" offset="5982647">As of the instant of his death, that property is hers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.032" offset="5999470">And if you're going to equalize between the community property estates and the common law estates, you would not want to allow the common law estates to have a condition a second look that wouldn't exist in the community property estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.101" offset="6067806">Now, I am not saying that that's a necessary judgment or one that you'd have to make or one that you couldn't put some exceptions in it, but Congress didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.618" offset="6101870">And the provision which Congress adopted is the one of course we're concerned with here today, 812 (e) (1) (b), and it does not provide as though it covers the situation, it is not phrased in terms of making sure property is subject to tax in the second estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.004" offset="6171355">What it says is that where an -- this is on our brief page 21, the statutory language is helpful to look at though I think there is no dispute about it but where an interest in property may terminate or fail on the occurrence of an event or the failure or an event to occur, this is very broad language and where another interest in the same property has passed from decedent to some other person and that person will enjoy the property then you don't get a marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.756" offset="6290369">Now that's a lot more than you'd have to say if all you are going to do is say we want to be sure we get at least one estate tax or if what all you wanted to do was deal with the life estate problem and it's a very clear mandate and it is in the Section under which the petitioner's here must claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.510" offset="6357452">It's a strong arm rule with the exception which I will just discuss, it doesn't permit of any exceptions and it can come down pretty hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.094" offset="6399770">Now the Congress did say one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.011" offset="6411368">If you want to put in your will a provision that your wife will not take under the will by unless she survives you by six months or you may permit that condition to operate but it can't be for more than 6 months and if you go beyond the 6 months period in you will it doesn't make any difference whether this operates or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.602" offset="6517739">Now just to make it clear that we understand the way this provision operates and it's been undisputed and accepted by the courts that if a dying husband gives $10,000 to his wife on the condition that she survive him by 8 months and she does survive 8 months and gets a $10,000 and it's going to be in her estate and there is no possibility of avoiding taxation, nonetheless that's taxable to his estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.971" offset="6623274">The congressional mandate is absolutely clear, you can't beyond 6 months.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.965" offset="6711254">You can't say in your will I will give my wife $10,000 if she survives to the date of distribution and that won't qualify because you don't know that the distribution will occur within the 6 month period and since it can in fact can occur later it will not give you the marital deduction if in fact that she takes it inside the 6 month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.977" offset="6823267">She still cannot get the marital deduction and why is that, is because it' being universally established in all the cases in the Senate report, in the regulations that the situation has to be viewed at the date of the descendant's death, you don't get a second look.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.408" offset="6892962">Now this is the law of the marital deduction, as we find it and I don't really believe it is disputed by petitioners here in a general way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.125" offset="6927862">The question is how are we going to apply these principles to the specific interest here in question and the question -- what we have here and I think was not emphasized on argument in chief is that that widow's allowance here is subject to two very specific conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.336" offset="7016678">This has been found and can be found in state decisions interpreting these widow's allowances where it made a difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.806" offset="7086582">So she must be un-remarried and alive on the date of the decree to get anything, but there is a separate, completely separate condition which is written in to California law as to each payment, no matter what the time of decree for the period to which it applies, she must also be un-remarried and alive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.748" offset="7802337">And as I say, there's no question the direct acquiescence is inconsistent with the argument I am making here, but I think look at a time when we're presenting the case to the Supreme Court, it's necessary to look and see what the law provides and you can't work the whole future cost course of the law by an acquiescence that was perhaps not as thoroughly thought out as it should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.277" offset="7904528">Now I think it's important when we talk about these cases to realize that if decedent in California had made a provision in his will that I want my wife to be paid $3,000 a month, if she survives me un-remarried to the date of each payment, he doesn't have a prayer of getting the marital deduction and I know this is just isn't any argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.674" offset="8406079">Now it is true that we have -- the regard of possibility they might be in a common accident, she be unconscious and couldn't reach up and scribble, but that seems to us to be small.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.913" offset="8443068">As long as there exists a right which she can do immediately after death, then we would allow it, but if it is subject to things beyond her control and we say that death, the possibility of her dying before the court gets around is clearly a distinction of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.887" offset="8514957">I don't know, I have been using word uncontrolled, being remarried is not necessarily uncontrolled but it's to avoid that condition you might have to refrain from doing something you wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.267" offset="8560410">So it's something that the widow might have to do without regard to her rights to an allowance and I think it's fair to assimilate those two together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.714" offset="8598235">Now, as I say, under the will, there is no prayer, why should there be a different result here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.363" offset="8620805">And as we see it, the petitioners make two main arguments, the first is a broad one and it appears in their, most explicitly in their reply brief at pages 1 and 7 and they come out quite flat footedly and say, well, the terminable interest rule does not apply to statutory widow's allowances and if I read their argument, they say that everything else in 812 (b) you've got to apply but the terminable interest just doesn't make any sense because it's going to disallow a lot of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.686" offset="8734072">Well, that maybe that it will disallow a large portion of them, but it also will allow, it has been found to allow and under the basic regulations and rulings adopted by the commission, will allow also a substantial number and if there's to be a change in this, it seems to us that it ought to go to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.900" offset="8814947">There's a somewhat anomalous rule of statutory construction that we have to face up to here that in 1948 when the marital deduction was passed and this gets back to Justice Stewart's point that 1948, when it was passed, there was a separate allowance and they were rather clear that this payment for the widow couldn't come in under the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.284" offset="8908466">Well, in 1950 because of this possibility of abuse, they removed that and they made some statements about law and at least some of the courts which have considered the problem and found a little awkward to say what a 1950 report can mean about Congress' intention in 1948, when it's perfectly clear that Congress at that time didn't intend it to apply at all, so there is a statutory construction problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.209" offset="9000208">But, it is also, if you're going to look at the 1950 report at all, it is very clear that and this of course is set forth in our brief that when you look to the marital deduction, you have to look to all the conditions and limitations and there can't be any warrant for taking all of them except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.111" offset="9075858">The basic administrative document is the 1953 ruling which has been cited throughout and that is squarely in accord with our present position that you looked a local law and if the right is enforceable independently of the window's survival, then it qualifies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2579.170" offset="10420015">Well, as I was seeing, there is one broad argument here that we shouldn't look to the terminable interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.711" offset="10446242">We think that by squarely and invasively, Senate report language it's contrary to the regulations, it's contrary to the 1953 ruling, no court has gone so far as to argue that you don't apply the terminable interest rule and in fact, as we read the briefs in the Ninth Circuit, it wasn't even contended to the Ninth Circuit that you didn't apply the terminable interest rule, that if you're going to hold for the petitioners, you have to find some way to work them in but you can't disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.899" offset="10555016">So that brings us to the second argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.662" offset="10565987">I think that what has to be the main argument of petitioners and that is when we talk about looking at these conditions, do we look to the date of the decree or do we look to the date of death?</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.242" offset="10612381">Now, as we pointed out in the situation in 812 (e) (1) (b) on the six months rule, it's imperative that you look to the date of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.852" offset="10654804">The whole statute is built around looking to the date of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.492" offset="10669328">The 1948 Senate reports are absolutely clear and repetitive on the point that you must look at the date of death and regulations have always adopted that and in every other context except this widow's allowance people have agreed that it just has to be the date of death and that this has been applied to the detriment of tax payers, and in cases which are much more important than the widow's allowance and we insist that in the terms of symmetry of the statute, you must apply the same rule here but we have to admit as the petitioner's have stated that the tax court and the Fifth Circuit have, after some hesitation and backing and filling, finally come out and said blatantly, well, we're going to go by the date of the decree, and they got to this, we think by dealing with the cases that had to deal with election by will and in our earlier discussions, we distinguish those because typically the widow need only say, I wish to elect against the will, and then she topples over that piece of paper is saved and the executor goes in, and it's enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.805" offset="10926582">And that's the typical rule on election against the will and we think that the cases, the Dower case and that group of cases which talk about substitution of Dower and so forth can all be explained in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.851" offset="10986768">Now there's two points, I should mention in closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.013" offset="11011427">First one, the taxpayer argues both in its brief but before the Ninth Circuit really only argues for the first fourteen months of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.074" offset="11059702">We think that there's a fundamental fallacy in the taxpayer's argument for the first fourteen months payment because they say the decree must be related back for purposes of eliminating the condition, but they say, of course you preserve the date of the decree as when the payment is made and all the conditions are fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.918" offset="11135039">That seems to us to be an inconsistent possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.850" offset="11142771">You can't take the decree back solely for the purpose of eliminating the conditions and then say the amount paid fourteen months later can be looked at, at that time and having eliminated all the conditions, you can't have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.622" offset="11205883">But when you date back the decree, what you're really doing is saying, on the date of death, a decree reads you shall have a payment of $3,000 each month that you survive and are un-remarried and that must fail on that ground alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.343" offset="11256769">If you date back the decree you're given, essentially the will provision, we were discussing earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.354" offset="11836792">That is a statutory provision in Section 812 (e) (1) (d).</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.847" offset="11878797">If a man dies without a will, the six months provision has no application whatsoever and the statutory right to a widow's allowance is much more is certain than any interest on an estate which a widow might take because it's given preference to the claims of certain creditors and that's a more profitable interest than an inter-state rightist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.461" offset="11957164">Now as to whether or not this Court can do anything about it, I'd like to read from the report of the Senate Finance Committee in 1954 “Your committee rejected a special provision added by the house that allowed widows' allowances to qualify for the marital deduction to the extent paid within one year of the decedent's death”.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.900" offset="12178996">They include United States against First National Bank of Augusta, Candler, Landers, Gale, Rudnick, Patty, Reynolds, Rensenhouse, Phelps against Bookwalter, Gardner's Estate, Avery, Ken against Wisener and many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.054" offset="12235630">Unless there is an isolated transaction, the lump sum awards have been allowed by many courts and the commissioner is acquiesced in some of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.920" offset="12271052">And more Circuit Courts have decided cases of that nature in favor of the taxpayers and against them, and in the respondent's brief it said, “A marital deduction is allowed for the value of property received under State Law where the widow elects to take against decedent's will,” now that's a fairly a statutory right, “Where under a State Law a widow obtains a fixed right to claim a non-terminable interest at her husband's death the mere procedural requirement of the widow signified her election or filed her claim which she might do immediately, does not make the interest meaningfully contingent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.449" offset="12497168">Her election to take the interest is therefore deemed or relate back to the date of the decedent's death and the marital deduction is permitted with respect to the property actually passing and vesting” and that's what petitioners would like this Court to do.</text>
