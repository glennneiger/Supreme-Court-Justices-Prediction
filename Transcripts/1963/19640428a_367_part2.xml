            <label>Mr. Helmer R. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="3.707" offset="118157">Thank you, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.695" offset="134144">Before the recess, Mr. Justice Harlan asked me about El Paso and Lexington Bank except that these cases reemphasized a necessity of market determination and measuring the effects of the merger in those markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.776" offset="226513">I don't think they have any clear relation to the case before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.105" offset="259741">El Paso dealt with a market which where the market was clear, Natural Gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.426" offset="309060">Now, there was a direct elimination of a competitor or of a potential competitor in a well-defined market.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.350" offset="340720">Lexington Bank, also the -- at least one of the lines of commerce there, the commercial banking was obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.002" offset="379382">The market was defined quite closely and there was an elimination of direct competition and of course the percentages there were high.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.045" offset="431522">I have no reason to believe that the District Court would have decided this case any differently than he did in the light of those cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="93.621" stopTime="99.898">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="93.621" offset="477811">Even on the -- even assuming that the Commerce Clause (Inaudible).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="helmer_r_johnson" startTime="99.898" stopTime="402.719">
            <label>Mr. Helmer R. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="99.898" offset="502993">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.509" offset="513442">The record here, as I was saying is, there's -- there is nothing in this record to indicate any anticompetitive effect whatsoever, notwithstanding as the District Court considered everything he could think off and all the arguments that were raised that indicated any likelihood, reasonable likelihood of anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.068" offset="611662">He went down the line, prior acquisitions, the intention of the parties, likelihood of suppression of products lines, elimination of competition, weakening of the companies in their respective lines, advantages resulting from the acquisition, concentration, change in market position, effects on competitors, ease of entry, tendency of the word monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.020" offset="735483">He found nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.170" offset="740080">He indicated any reasonably probable anticompetitive effect, and the Government here points to nothing that would indicate a reasonable probability of anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.671" offset="790026">They argue that this should be assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.090" offset="803715">But why should they be assumed?</text>
            <text syncTime="177.793" offset="814582">Reasonable probability is subject to proof perhaps not as precisely as past events but enough to guide our lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.936" offset="859094">We know quite a bit about the cause and effect and in trying to evaluate the probability of anticompetitive effects without any facts to go off, I guess it's completely useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.474" offset="921266">The Government in its brief and its arguments has mentioned concentration and dominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.679" offset="954075">They don't say what they mean by this or how they should be used in the application of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.487" offset="981347">Surely, in the light of the legislative history of Section 7, from the rulings of this Court, they cannot be serious about an automatic application of the statute simply to something that is big.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.747" offset="1046340">When I say just their word about statistics, the Government here admittedly has had difficulty with its statistics but they keep on using.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.908" offset="1099003">They apologize for them -- in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.899" offset="1106944">They still keep on using them.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.504" offset="1117393">They'd tried here to add statistics that couldn't be added.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.738" offset="1146337">Metal Working Industry, the can industry, reports to the Bureau of Census in terms of based boxes of steel used, they don't report in terms of the number of containers made.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.692" offset="1206105">The glass container industry reports to the Bureau of Census in units.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.238" offset="1232332">No one has ever seen fit to combine the statistics, so far apart of the industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.944" offset="1263156">The Government here tried to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.590" offset="1281755">The Government clerk knowing nothing about the industries whatsoever, made certain assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.307" offset="1312580">He assumed that all cans were the same size.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.827" offset="1326686">He assumed that all cans were the same product mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.760" offset="1346435">How wrong he was?</text>
            <text syncTime="312.668" offset="1354062">The record shows for example that approximately 14,000 evaporated milk cans can be made up from this ton of steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.906" offset="1395022">Approximately 2800 lard cans can be made from a ton of steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.755" offset="1418428">He ignored all products.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.751" offset="1438386">He tried to add the two together and came up with some figures which have no relation whatsoever to reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.255" offset="1476420">The Government mentioned some figure of Continental having 23%, Hazel-Atlas, 3% of something.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.129" offset="1511842">The figures could be varied by as much as you like depending on the hypothesis used.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.241" offset="1540368">The District Court considered this very carefully and concluded that he states in his opinion that the combinations were predicated on implausible hypothesis, not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.786" offset="1598568">Their figures are worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.639" offset="1609958">Your Honors here, we have a case that was carefully tried by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.697" offset="1634200">There was careful pretrial, careful analysis of the evidence down to minute details, or carefully prepared findings and opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.161" offset="1684041">I submit, this decision of the District Court should be affirmed.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Ralph S. Spritzer</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="402.719" stopTime="405.805">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="402.719" offset="1714239">Mr. Spritzer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="405.805" stopTime="612.436">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="405.805" offset="1726568">Just a few brief points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.630" offset="1749870">Mr. Johnson asked how I was able to state to the Court that the record shows a narrow differential or relatively narrow differential in the price as between tin cans and glass containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.355" offset="1844746">Apart from the numerous statements in memorandum of companies like the Continental Can and Hazel-Atlas Company which discussed the danger of shift in business if price is altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.180" offset="1908067">There are other exhibits which indicate that the range of differential is relatively narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.223" offset="1932309">I would like to refer the Court to a study made of can versus glass by Owens-Illinois which is in the record at 2458.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.071" offset="1979643">That gives in graphic form relative prices for beer, detergents, polish, vegetables, baby food, coffee and aerosol, a wide range of the general categories of product for which the containers are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.671" offset="2062085">The prices which appear on that graph give the figures the price per gross, per 144.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.882" offset="2094895">For example, in vegetables in the 26 ounce size down in the right hand corner, it would appear that the price is roughly judging by that graph about $8 of gross for the can and about $9 of gross for the glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.130" offset="2199907">Now, Mr. Johnson stated to the Court that he find has no difficulty in observing the existence of direct competition as between milk bottles and the plastic containers in which milk is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.448" offset="2261138">But the competition which he finds typical of that between glass and metal cans is said to be tangential or indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.187" offset="2304084">I find this astonishing because one can go to the supermarket shelves as to the investigators in this case and list dozens and dozens and dozens of items which appeared side-by-side in glass and in metal cans, but I go further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.443" offset="2373151">One can find the same manufacturer putting the self same item in both so as to get the customers who like it in glass and the customers who like it in can.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.824" offset="2422680">We had in this record the testimony of one such packer, a fairly large company which packs various types of apple products known as the Muscle Man Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.772" offset="2470431">Their purchasing agent testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.329" offset="2484642">He said that his company puts the following items in both cans and glasses, the self same item.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.881" offset="2518915">Apple sauce, spiced apple rings, apple based jellies, apple butter, apple juice and the sorted pie fillings.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.878" offset="2558934">That testimony appears at record 479 and following the witnesses name Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.471" offset="2593207">Mr. Johnson asks how we know that for most uses, as I put it in my opening argument, glass and metal alone are practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.756" offset="2646392">Well, it was testified and without contradiction by a food expert that for purposes of food canning, these are the only containers that can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.889" offset="2710967">There is also a testimony which is uncontradicted that for beverages, carbonated beverages and beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.455" offset="2741164">The only containers which can be used are glass and metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.751" offset="2758405">Those two items standing alone, soft drinks and beer on the one hand and all cans for food canning on the other, total over 33 billion items out of a combined total production of 60 billion cans and glass containers.</text>
