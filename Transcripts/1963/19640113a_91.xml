            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="10.800" offset="146578">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.945" offset="155146">I am appearing as counsel for the amicus, the AFL-CIO by courtesy of counsel for the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.146" offset="199973">I wish to address myself principally to the question whether Wiley is bound by the agreement to arbitrate under the collective bargaining agreement entered into between the union and Interscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.559" offset="261622">Now, viewing this question simply as one of private contract law, Section 90 of the New York Stock Corporation Law with control and Wiley quite clearly, under that state statute, would be bound by the collective bargaining agreement, at least up until the point that it expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.245" offset="352319">However, we agree with counsel for petitioner and with the court below that this is not a matter of state law, but of federal labor relations policy which is controlled by federal doctrine derived from the Labor Management Relations Act and decisions of the Board, and other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.268" offset="444479">While the state law might be taken over as a part of federal law, if it were given any effect, it would be by that sort of adoption rather than simply by its own standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.186" offset="500067">In general, we think that the relations between an employer, a union, and the employees are not controlled either by state law nor yet by a private contract or agency law, but rather by the Labor Management Relations Act and the principles derived therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.927" offset="583032">For this reason, a collective bargaining contract is quite different from an ordinary contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.269" offset="608423">The union selected by a majority of the employees and an appropriate bargaining unit is by federal statute the exclusive bargaining representative of all of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.543" offset="657533">It can bind dissenting employees, employees not yet fired and the employee here must deal with it whether the employer wishes to or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.275" offset="700479">If the employer in the union reached agreement, they must embody that agreement in a written contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.818" offset="730676">This contract in turn is binding on all employees including dissenters and people hired thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.947" offset="763173">The opportunity of the employees to dispense for the one union as their collective bargaining representative and to supplant it with another is quite limited by a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.362" offset="808835">The contract itself is not a simple private contract but a code for the industrial community.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.895" offset="838928">As this Court said in Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation, it is an effort to erect a system of industrial self government.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.894" offset="878947">Now, the National Labor Relations Act likewise regulates and in some detail, the rights of parties to collective bargaining agreements to terminate or modify them.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.929" offset="923042">That regulation will be found in part in Section 8 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="210.349" offset="944776">Finally, the National Labor Relations Board doctrine likewise controls whether an employer must continue to deal with the union as the exclusive bargaining representative notwithstanding changes and the methods of an employer doing business as when the business is sold or when the method of operation has otherwise changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.163" offset="1040071">Now, the petitioner suggests that this body of Board doctrine as to when an employer or in what circumstances an employer must or need not continue to bargain with the union as exclusive bargaining representative, should also control whether an outstanding and unexpired collective bargaining agreement continues in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.861" offset="1142784">We agree with the counsel for the petitioner that in general, this body of doctrine should control for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.477" offset="1177266">Now, what is this body of doctrine?</text>
            <text syncTime="271.231" offset="1188342">In general it is that if the operation of the enterprise is so drastically changed that the old industrial community is dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.377" offset="1228884">The old bargaining unit then becomes inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.850" offset="1242781">The employer has no further obligation to bargain with the union as exclusive bargaining representative in that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.693" offset="1278098">Now, this -- this salute --</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="294.771" offset="1282487">So, do you -- do you suggest that that event or that set of fact never came about at any point in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_e_harris" startTime="305.116" stopTime="448.530">
            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="305.116" offset="1323865">No, Your Honor and I will come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.439" offset="1337135">We think it is quite clear that it did not come about for several months whether it ever came about, we don't know, but I will come to that in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.130" offset="1375901">Now, the petitioner quotes and for the decision of the Board in Cruse Motors which summarizes the Board doctrine as to the obligation of the employer to continue the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.525" offset="1437445">A mere change -- and this is a quotation from the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.133" offset="1451865">"A mere change in ownership of the employment enterprise is not so unusual a circumstance as to affect the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.023" offset="1483421">Where the enterprise remains essentially the same, the obligation to bargain of a prior employer devolves upon his successor and title."</text>
            <text syncTime="355.116" offset="1523858">The form that the change of ownership takes is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.709" offset="1538173">That is whether it's a sale of assets, a merger, or consolidation, or a stock purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.014" offset="1563460">It's the continued existence or lack of it of the industrial community that is decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.149" offset="1588015">Indeed, transfer of ownership is by itself irrelevant for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.756" offset="1614346">An employer may, without any change in ownership, so hold to his operations that a bargaining unit that was formally appropriate is dissolved or submerged in a larger unit or that a new unit is created.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.933" offset="1675055">If that happens, he is no longer obligated to bargain with the union certified for the whole unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.292" offset="1700551">Of course the collective bargaining agreement may inhibit the employer in making changes that will destroy the collective bargaining unit but if it does not, this problem can't arise even without any sort of change of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.157" offset="1772022">Now, if by reason of the changes and operation, the old industrial community disappears and a new appropriate bargaining unit comes into existence in which the union represents only a minority and that is what the petitioner says happens here.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.923" offset="1843075">Then we would agree that it's probably an unfair labor practice even for the employer to continue to bargain with the union as exclusive bargaining representative for all of the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.676" offset="1906082">I say that -- that the employer here contends, the petitioner, and this is what they contended from even before the merger took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.756" offset="1946415">That where one -- where the method of operation is so changed that the industrial community is dissolved, and the old group of employees is merged into a different and larger group of employees so that the union now represents only a minority and what is now the appropriate bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.284" offset="2032515">They say that the employer is under no obligation to continue to bargain with the union as the representative of the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.784" offset="2074520">And indeed we agree with that, we think that given that set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.564" offset="2089671">Indeed, it is probably an unfair labor practice for the employer too.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.262" offset="2108374">This Court has held for example that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to make a contract with a minority union as the exclusive bargaining representative for all of the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.900" offset="2182980">Our answer to that in this case is that that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.231" offset="2208266">The record here quite clearly shows that the Wiley employees, the Interscience employees, continued to work at the old Interscience Plant for some months after the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.300" offset="2272528">The record is silent as to when they were finally, physically moved to the Wiley plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.133" offset="2299904">I believe counsel for the petitioner stated that it was early in January of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.184" offset="2324146">But the record is quite clear that no such change took place immediately upon the legal merger which was October 2nd, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.341" offset="2364688">That for some months thereafter, the old Interscience employees continued to work for Wiley at the old Interscience plant just as before presumably under new management.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.114" offset="2411813">Presumably there was a change in the top personnel other than Mr. Lieb who survived, as we say the industrial community, did for some months.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.253" offset="2468342">Now, as to what happened around the end of the year, at that point, the employees were moved physically to the old Wiley plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.198" offset="2588191">The very point which is here at issue before the Court was debated between the parties through the summer of 1961 preceding the merger and they reached no agreement upon it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.206" offset="5152162">The recognition clause of the contract, Article 1, Section 1, couldn't be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.028" offset="5179434">I think the same thing is true as to the union shop provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.097" offset="5203780">The old contract could be expired only to the old Interscience employees obviously, not to new hires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.424" offset="5237112">However, even assuming the submergence of the old community, what reason is there why the contract should not be applied to the old Interscience employees as respects such matters as severance pay and accrued vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.870" offset="5322898">Now, the petitioner actually did pay the severance employee pay provided by the old contract to 11 employees who quit when they were moved over to Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.063" offset="5375666">Petitioner has searched in its brief that if they accrued vacation pay through the end of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.718" offset="5398235">Though the record is silent on that, the payments to the welfare and pension plan under the old contract or in exactly the same status, these are accrued financial rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.901" offset="5454973">Why should not those rights be enforced under the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.280" offset="5472528">Whatever happened to the old industrial community?</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.513" offset="5489455">Now, when you come to seniority rights, the question for the arbitrator would be, whether the contract conferred rights surviving the expiration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.103" offset="5539819">In Zdanok v. Glidden, the Second Circuit held for example that that particular contract did contain seniority rights, rights as to rehire and recall which survived the expiration of the contract and the shutting down of the plant and its movable to a new location some hundreds of miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.745" offset="5626337">If the arbitrator found that the contract was intended to confer seniority rights which survived its expiration, the further question would be, "How are these rights to be applied in the chain circumstances?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.829" offset="5690702">That is how can -- assuming that there are seniority rights under the expired contract, how can this be given to the old Interscience employees in the new work -- framework at Wiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.097" offset="5759770">Now, the petitioner argues that once the operation is so changed that the bargaining unit disappears which it asserts happened in early January of 1962 and that they had in mind all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.506" offset="5829360">They assert that once that happens, the employer is no longer bound to deal with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.310" offset="5856632">Indeed, that it can no longer properly deal with it as a matter of federal labor relations policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.006" offset="5887352">However, there is no federal labor relations policy against the enforcement of contracts of a minority union, assuming that it's a valid contract, when there is no majority union in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.880" offset="5950882">In Retail Clerks International Union v. Lion Dry Goods, 369 U.S. 17, this Court held that a contract entered into by a union which had lost its majority during the strike, this was a contract dealing with the settlement of the strike providing for reinstatement of the strikers covering certain other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.295" offset="6036564">This Court held that that contract was enforceable by the union under Section 301 even though a union had admittedly lost its majority in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.255" offset="6080345">Indeed, as long as there is no exclusive bargaining representative in the plant, and no exclusive bargaining contract covering the plant, there is no federal policy against individual employment contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.545" offset="6149517">An individual worker can enter into an employment contract with the employer and that contract will be enforced so long as there is no collective bargaining representative and no contract which undertakes to supersede that individual contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.559" offset="6213569">If the contract is in -- is for the purpose of forwarding collective bargaining or if the employer refuses to bargain because of the individual contracts, then the contracts should be void under this Court's decision in J.I. case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.634" offset="6273860">But there is no federal policy in general against either individual contracts or minority union contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.591" offset="6305729">Now, if another union were certified as the exclusive bargaining representative at Wiley, then perhaps this union could no longer enforce the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.502" offset="6357347">Perhaps the new union would become the agent even to enforce rights which survived under the old contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.385" offset="6384933">And of course, the new union could enter into a new contract which might change the rights under the old contract with the exception of such individual rights as it indivisibly vested.But that is not the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.242" offset="6448358">There is no new union here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.257" offset="6456404">There is no new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.902" offset="6466957">And simply as the holder of the contract, though not perhaps as the exclusive bargaining representative, the union surely still has status to enforce whatever rights survived under the old contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.424" offset="6545115">We believe that -- that the federal policy should favor enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement and protection of rights accruing under it notwithstanding such matters as changes of ownership as indeed the Court of Appeals felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.272" offset="6616482">The Labor Management Relations Act is concerned with promoting industrial piece not with such technicalities as whether a plant is required by stock purchase, merger, asset purge -- merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.904" offset="6662980">Here, actually these technicalities support the union's position and it could prevail under the New York law if that were applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.614" offset="6693804">But we think that that is not the main point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.067" offset="6711672">The National Labor Relations policy favors the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements as a means of promoting industrial harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.175" offset="6744064">It so states in numerous pace -- places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.688" offset="6754095">It provides a special forum, the federal courts under 3012 enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.977" offset="6775306">And as I said, there is no federal policy against enforcement even after a union loses its majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.588" offset="6809684">Finally, the denial of enforcement, would this involve -- manifest injustice?</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.204" offset="6832149">These employees would be denied their bargain for quid pro quo and they would be denied whatever they gave up to get the collective bargaining agreement when it was negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.653" offset="6881991">Finally, let me state again that while I have discussed these questions as to what an arbitrator might hold the liabilities to be under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.012" offset="6927444">One, before the physical consolidation to even assuming a physical consolidation, that I don't think that any of these questions are for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.685" offset="6982092">I think that all that is for it now is the question whether Wiley was bound for some period of time to arbitrate on the old agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.646" offset="7037994">And we submit that it clearly was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.883" offset="7058892">Now, what I have said -- again, I would like to repeat that under the Labor Board doctrine which is applicable here, it wouldn't matter really whether any merger of companies or any change of ownership at all had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.015" offset="7147395">As I have said, it is quite possible for a single employer with no change of operation to so change his method of operation as to destroy the bargaining unit and as to undercut the statutory duty to bargain with a union for that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.565" offset="7225657">Even there, we would take the position as we do here that the employer continues bound under the old contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.296" offset="7260557">And that the union has standing to enforce it, unless and until there is some new union that negotiates a new contract that supersedes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.863" offset="7306846">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.475" offset="7337253">Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.162" offset="7351986">It seems to me that Mr. Harris in his argument, he mentioned essential point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.356" offset="7384795">He suggests that even though the union lost its representative rights at the time when the Interscience employees were merged into a much larger Wiley group that nevertheless those employees might continue to have individual contract rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.789" offset="7462536">They may, but that is not the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.005" offset="7479359">The question here is not what rights due the employees coming over from the Interscience and being put into the Wiley establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.619" offset="7517811">The question is not here as to what rights if any of those employees may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.792" offset="7538500">The question here is whether the union which formally represented those employees and upon the collective -- in a collective bargaining group and which now no longer represents them may arbitrate, not may sue for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.724" offset="7610284">It's conceivable that these employees having rights hypothetically had given powers of attorney to -- to the union to sue in behalf of John Jones and John Smith to vindicate personal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.390" offset="7676949">It's conceivable that such a lawsuit might have been commenced not by the union in a representative capacity but by the union as an attorney for a particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.847" offset="7722715">This proceeding, however, is an application to compel Wiley to arbitrate with the union under a contract which is no longer effective in which became ineffective when the Interscience Industrial Community was dissolved and terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.517" offset="7805471">At that time, whatever I say, I say again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.250" offset="7820413">At that time whatever the individual rights may have been, certainly the arbitral right disappeared because this was a --</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles H. Lieb</label>
            <text syncTime="1943.129" offset="7875897">Because pursuant to a plan announced to the union in advance of the merger actually put into operation on the date of the merger and actually completed pursuant to plan within two months plus following the merger, the Interscience industrial community was physically broken up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.644" offset="7973909">It was moved per plant, block, stock and barrel over into a much larger plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.300" offset="7996583">The Interscience employees were relieved from the work that they formally were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.138" offset="8019884">There was no longer Interscience work to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.667" offset="8030020">They were put on Wiley jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.503" offset="8041409">They were no longer represented for collective bargaining purposes by this union because this union represented a group of 40 clericals working in an Interscience establishment and not 40 out of 400 employees doing similar work in the similar unit working in the Wiley establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.777" offset="8130435">In other words, we say that -- that as of the date when the -- when the dissolution of the Interscience enterprise was commenced, the Interscience collective bargaining contract was no longer appropriate.</text>
