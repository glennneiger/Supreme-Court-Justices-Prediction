            <text syncTime="9.556" offset="141563">Suppose this man had never gotten to a jury, suppose on arraignment, the judge had made coercive statement of that kind and counsel had then decided to plead guilty and -- and he had plead guilty and it was reversed, would -- would that be in jeopardy because it deprived him of a jury trial?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_kasanof" startTime="38.293" stopTime="400.172">
            <label>Mr. Robert Kasanof</label>
            <text syncTime="38.293" offset="256502">He would be put after his collateral attack or appellate review, what have you, in status quo ante.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.603" offset="281788">He would be back where he was before the harm was done to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.765" offset="298402">That's exactly our contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.030" offset="307493">Two harms were done to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.556" offset="313553">He was coerced into pleading guilty and he sets that plea aside but he was also coerced out of a jury trial after four days of trial in which -- this is unlike Downum, no evidence was taken in.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.645" offset="365902">This is a case where the Government had put in most of its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.538" offset="381576">Four days of jury trial makes a critical difference and if there were magical way to avoid the passage of time and reassemble that jury and let him continue, that might be a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.328" offset="432671">But the passage of time, the discharge and separation of the jury forever destroyed in effective way to put him back where he was before the injury was done to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.352" offset="480737">I -- I would like to say that we are not seeking to come within an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.591" offset="529742">The basic -- a basic question here is not the Ball rule, which the Government speaks of so eloquently, the basic question here is the Constitution, which prohibits anyone being twice put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.248" offset="584391">The Government seeks to expand an exception which already exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.296" offset="604557">This Court is -- is called upon in this case to decide whether it will give a narrow constricted meaning to the protection against double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.344" offset="644786">We say and I think the double jeopardy protection is one of those protections which everyone talks about, laymen and lawyers alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.963" offset="679267">It's like every man's home is his castle, that's double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.024" offset="695463">This is part of the currency, which the general public associates with all fair and civilized criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.955" offset="731199">For this Court to restrict that protection does no service to the cause of law enforcement, the Government argues that they're trying to concur a benefit on the defendant by making appellate review freer.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.449" offset="793161">They want to confer that benefit by abrogating an expressed provision of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.931" offset="815104">That is not the kind of benefit which defendants or society at large needs to have conferred upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.625" offset="845824">Basically, this is a standard mistrial case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.836" offset="866722">The subsequent judgment, coerced judgment does not alter it.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.344" offset="896711">It seems incredible that the Government should argue that Tateo, because in addition to being coerced out of his jury trial, was coerced into an -- an illegal plea, served seven years, came back, the Government reinstated him, threatened him with the -- the electric chair, is in a worst position than Downum.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.358" offset="980825">And that is what I take to be the essential thrust of the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.527" offset="1005484">We do not attack and -- and this decision does not involve changing the basic retrial rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.913" offset="1035055">But it does involve something that has a real practical meaning for defendants in the trial courts today.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.506" offset="1061386">There is a pressure on the District Courts with an increasing load of work to get dispositions to move things along, to conclude trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.418" offset="1109034">This case stands, we would assert for a simple and wholesome salutary proposition that when you've reached that point, where both sides have joined issue and a jury trial has commenced, the burden of an improper termination of that trial falls on the prosecution that the defendant's liberty cannot be twice assailed, that it can't be required to run the gantlet twice and this is not an academic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.840" offset="1238706">Judge Weinfeld speaks in his opinion setting this side about the very real ordeal of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.033" offset="1267545">The Government wants Tateo to undergo that ordeal again.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.075" offset="1287711">This Court, when it extended the mistrial rule in Gori, said that, "Where a judge acted to terminate the defendant's right of jury trial, out of the solicitude for the defendant's rights, that was not going to be used to bar retrial."</text>
            <text syncTime="312.696" offset="1354167">And explicitly in Gori said, "We defer the question on whether on -- on the question of what happens when the judge unwisely or arbitrarily exercises his discretion to terminate a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.710" offset="1418219">You have here an unappealed finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.803" offset="1430549">The Government has no quarrel with Judge Weinfeld's finding that this trial, Tateo's constitutional right to conclude the trial, was coercively terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.120" offset="1471822">The Government does not question the correctness of Judge Weinfeld's finding to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.320" offset="1496691">The question which was deferred in Gori is here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.925" offset="1511111">It is the question of whether when a defendant in a federal criminal case commences his jury trial and the judge takes that right from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.787" offset="1558549">He can be tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.469" offset="1569207">There is no reason for distinguishing this case from the plain holding of the mistrial cases that the Government's argument is that because he is worse off before -- because he suffered a greater harm, he should have fewer rights to the protection against double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.444" offset="1645171">Such an argument, I respectfully urge, does not sound logically and doesn't make good sense in view of the kind of pressure which realistically, day to day working trial on his face in the federal criminal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.261" offset="1748407">The judge had called him in his office and told him what he said (Inaudible) what he said here and that the State could then try and fight.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.250" offset="1904410">And the lawyer thought it over and said, "Alright, we'll -- we'll do that."</text>

            <text syncTime="507.944" offset="2135124">That's what Judge Weinfeld found here.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.941" offset="2299173">I can see, as a practical reality to the kind of fair-minded, open rational discussion between prosecutors and defense counsel, which we all know goes on in trial of criminal cases, and I can see the same factual result being the result of a brutal cruel calculated threat and attempt to punish the defendant for exercising his right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.618" offset="2389870">Now, Judge Weinfeld found that this was a threat and the Government has not contested Judge Weinfeld's finding and I think that's as far as we have to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.449" offset="2433128">Other cases would turn on their facts but I think this -- the mistrial cases and I think there are no exceptions to say that when a man is forced against his will and -- and certainly, no benefit, no tenderness to the defendant here, nothing like Gori, but bludgeoned effectively, objectively, whatever the judge's intention, bludgeoned out of his right to complete that jury trial, that ends it constitutionally.</text>
