            <label>Mr. Warren E. Hall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">This is about -- of what -- of how this case fits into the theory of the doctrine of the case of Leedom versus Kyne is most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.800" offset="170611">We say that without the Leedom -- with the Kyne case, without that, because of general principles of equity in -- in the United States District Courts, as recognized, this Court -- by this Court all the way back and I'll do as one of the earlier counts that did refer back all the way to Marbury versus Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.762" offset="250441">As a matter of fact, I do in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.136" offset="259950">But the jurisdiction of the District Court in the current case was predicated upon at least six of the identical facts which -- or situations which exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.347" offset="320763">First, the Board's action was contrary to statute, and it was just as contrary to statute as it was in Kyne case, and in direct conflict with an expressed statutory prohibition which the legislature had reflected in amending the definitive section of employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.658" offset="390040">It was not an action for review, as was the case in -- neither in Kyne or in this case wasn't an action for a rule -- a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.374" offset="424835">It was an action set aside acts taken by an agency in excess of statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.836" offset="450748">In both cases, the Board exercised powers which the Congress had specifically withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.806" offset="474572">And that's reflected in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.971" offset="487215">In both cases, the rights of the parties were adversely affected by the act of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.370" offset="512815">And if one is deprived of a right granted by a statute, he is per se, may it please the Court, damaged, and this Court so held in Leedom versus Kyne.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.986" offset="551267">This employer had no more and no less recourse to unfair labor practice proceedings and the Section 9 review proceedings then did the Union in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.858" offset="610826">They both had exactly the same rights and they both have exactly the same rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.333" offset="632665">There is no basis, whatsoever, upon which to distinguish between the status of an employer and the status of a Union in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.026" offset="667460">You -- probability is merely probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.939" offset="683133">The fact is that the Union, and as the Board contended in its brief in kind, which we've set forth in a footnote in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.871" offset="714898">The Board contended there, and they contended strongly, that the Union had recourse elsewhere, but that it didn't make any difference if they had recourse on the unfair labor act proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.299" offset="768606">I respectfully submit that what the respondent here, what I'm doing, my client is doing here, is not to try to enlarge the doctrine set forth in the Kyne case.</text>
