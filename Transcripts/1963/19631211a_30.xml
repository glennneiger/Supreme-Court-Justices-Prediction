            <text syncTime="5.974" offset="127248">Mr. Wulf, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="8.195" offset="136129">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.968" offset="139264">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.926" offset="155042">On the facts of this case as I related them yesterday, the question that's presented to the Court now for its decision is whether the appellants' plain right to exercise and enjoy their First Amendment rights of speech and assembly can be suppressed in advance by an injunction, the worst kind of prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.742" offset="270294">We think it begs the question to talk about this case in terms of the Mine Workers case which was the ostensible basis for the Alabama Supreme Court's injunction decision and we think that it also begs the question to talk about it in terms of the concepts that have flowed from the Mine Workers case such as the jurisdiction -- to determine jurisdiction, void orders, substance of void orders, frivolous void orders and all the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.974" offset="387218">We think these are all irrelevant where First Amendment rights are asserted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="77.944" stopTime="88.239">
            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="77.944" offset="415117">Is that beyond limitation for them (Inaudible) not with your case but what do you think of (Inaudible) limitation under the jurisdiction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="88.239" stopTime="638.425">
            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="88.239" offset="456286">I think that very little is left under the case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.503" offset="485334">The rule of law that we urge the Court to adopt in this case is that essentially, that the First Amendment simply will not tolerate injunctions against political speech and political assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.392" offset="548968">Now, in the way this case comes up to this Court, it comes in a novel context.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.428" offset="585122">And although it is novel in this case, in -- at this stage of our history, I think it's safe to say that there's been a proliferation of the use of injunctions of this sort, temporary restraining orders against speech and that other cases that raise the same question promised to come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.870" offset="694836">Now, I think the facts of this case dramatically -- excuse me -- demonstrate why the rule that we urge can and ought to be adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.742" offset="762337">The injunction which the appellants are held to have violated and of which they were convicted was based on three local ordinances of the City of Fairfield and we can discuss this very quickly, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.776" offset="834435">Two of them, together, constituted a flat prohibition against the distribution of leaflets, handbills and any other kind of literature in the public streets and in the -- all the public portions of the City of Fairfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.817" offset="910608">This wasn't a permit requirement which would be unconstitutional on its face as well, this was a flat prohibition and Lovell v. Griffin, Jamison, Talley, all of them, together, make this ordinance unconstitutional on its face indisputably.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.158" offset="979989">The other ordinance that was -- that which -- which was the basis for the injunction in this case was one that required a permit from the mayor in order to hold a public meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.104" offset="1023770">Now, this ordinance, based on the (Inaudible) in Kansas also unconstitutional on its face, clearly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.917" offset="1059088">It has no standards in it as those two cases require, nor have any judicial standards been imported into the case, so it is unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.221" offset="1104227">Moreover, it's unconstitutional as applied in this case because it was applied not against the meeting that was to be held in a public street or in a public park.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.922" offset="1143097">It was applied against the meeting that was to be held in a private hall in Fairfield, private hall that had no connection at all with the -- with the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.812" offset="1186670">And we assert that the State or local municipality has no power whatsoever to require that a permit be applied for before any individual or any group seeks to hold a meeting in a private auditorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.132" offset="1259917">Although the context is different, it is as if somebody who wanted to hold the political meeting in Carnegie Hall would have to ask for permit from the Mayor of the City of New York or from the police commissioner, I think it's unthinkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.879" offset="1314879">So, the three ordinances that are involved in this case and which were the basis for the injunction or I think without dispute unconstitutional on their faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.614" offset="1361795">The appellee seems to have conceded this and the Government's amicus curiae makes this -- grants likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.150" offset="1399933">We then come to the injunction which was based on these three indisputably unconstitutional ordinances and I suggest that on the basis of Near versus Minnesota particularly and from other sound constitutional principles from cases in which the questions of reason and been articulated by this Court that it necessarily follows that speech, that political speech, political assembly cannot be enjoined in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.636" offset="1565968">If any description at all can describe the effect of such an injunction on speech, I think that it must be described as the most pernicious kind of prior restraint and this Court has condemned prior restraints over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.474" offset="1641305">Now, this isn't a -- an abstract right that is the right to be able to speech freely without prior restraints because as this Court has said and as many people have recognized over and over again, speech and assembly in our nation is the very foundation of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.583" offset="1749661">It is upon the right of speech and assembly that all of our political activity rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.803" offset="1790621">It is upon speech and assembly that the determinations about how society is to be ordered rests and if political speech and political assembly can be enjoined in advance, then I fear that the very firm foundation of the First Amendment will be seriously weakened.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.455" offset="1917158">I think it's instructive to point out several of the -- several examples which we have in our brief about the way in which the temporary restraining order and injunctions have -- have been invoked in very recent times against speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.088" offset="2015692">And this case, as well as these examples which I set out, I think will persuade the Court that any injunction issued or temporary restraining order issued against speech and assembly can, as Justice Frankfurter said in the Mine Workers case, be treated as if it were nothing other than alluded to the newspaper and can be disregarded with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.081" offset="2127705">Now, in our case, the ordinances on which the injunction was based are unarguably unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.254" offset="2164381">The injunction itself is unarguably unconstitutional as a prior restraint that is based on unconstitutional ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.747" offset="2210356">If the face of all this, the Alabama Supreme Court said that the ordinance that the injunction must be obeyed by the appellants in this case and what they were saying in effect was that no matter how unconstitutional the injunction is that these appellants must pay sterile homage and it was nothing more than that to a court order which was not a court order but which was mere usurpation of the court's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.032" offset="2351522">There are other examples, at page 30 in our brief, of temporary restraining orders which courts have in the past year or so all over the country, not merely in Alabama, not merely in the South but in California and New York in which courts have issued temporary restraining orders, ground was temporary restraining orders, to enjoin in two cases which we have cited in our brief at note 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.298" offset="2468551">The distribution of political literature in the California gubernatorial campaign in 1962, one judge issued TRO against the distribution of some literature which suggested that Governor Brown and the other democratic incumbents were sought on communism and another judge issued a restraining order prohibiting the distribution of two pamphlets which were critical of -- of Mr. Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.107" offset="2587773">And the TROs were issued before the -- before election day as I understand it they were obeyed and several days after election, each of the complaining parties went into the Court and asked that the TROs be dissolved and they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.236" offset="2656319">And --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="638.425" offset="2657050">What grounds -- on the grounds that they were unconstitutional or the grounds that it was moot?</text>
            <text syncTime="643.938" offset="2679097">Which was it, do you recall?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="644.956" stopTime="653.817">
            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="644.956" offset="2683173">On the grounds that it was moot, Your Honor, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.341" offset="2696756">This was -- this were the complainants themselves who went into -- complaints were gotten the TRO went back to court and asked that they be dissolved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="653.817" stopTime="656.434">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="653.817" offset="2718595">Oh, I see, yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="656.434" stopTime="1091.697">
            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="656.434" offset="2729148">And in New York, a judge of the New York Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the appearance of Herbert Aptheker at the University of Buffalo on the ground that he was a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party and this was at a forum at University of Buffalo, where such diverse people as Oswald Mosley from England and (Inaudible) Thomas from New York had spoken freely as they probably should.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.724" offset="2862268">And -- but once they -- when the TRO was issued against Aptheker, he defied to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.049" offset="2887555">The board of trustees refused to allow him to speak and that case is now on appeal in the New York courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.384" offset="2932903">And there are other cases cited in the footnote and there are cases cited in the NAACP amicus brief which is filed in this case which give other examples of the same kind of use of the temporary restraining order to interfere with constitutionally protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.379" offset="3032900">And again, the pernicious thing about it is that in a normal case, as far as I know in every case except this case, the defendants against to whom the TROs run have acquiesced in these because they believe that if they violate them, they will be subject to criminal contempt convictions and will not be able to challenge the constitutionality of the TRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.138" offset="3131956">So that the effect of the proliferation of the use of these kinds of court orders has had a very serious and substantial effect on -- and has impaired the rights of free speech in a wide variety of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.705" offset="3210219">And in the case at bar, although the bill of complaint alleged that the reason that this meeting or to be enjoined was because its purpose was to create tension, ill will disturbances and disorderly conduct between the races and that would be a public nuisance injurious to the health, comfort or welfare of the City of Fairfield and would create a disturbance, incite a riot, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.939" offset="3335084">It just so happens that the evening before this meeting was scheduled, the appellant, National States Rights Party had held another meeting in Fairfield which was perfectly peaceful at which the public attended without any question whatsoever of disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.916" offset="3415019">And there was no basis in the present bill of complaint for the city to go into court to say that there were -- there was a danger of inciting to riot and disruptions of peace and good order.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.104" offset="3479803">The fact that they also said it wasn't going to create tension, ill-will, et cetera, is not, of course, by itself any grounds whatsoever upon which to interfere with the speech and the trial court, of course, gave the real reason why this TRO had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.892" offset="3562977">He said that, they in that county, “We're going to do everything they could to maintain the status quo.”</text>
            <text syncTime="873.454" offset="3597145">So they weren't fearful of disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.033" offset="3611460">They were not fearful of any kind of disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.345" offset="3628701">They were just fearful that the status quo was going to be disrupted, but certainly, that's no basis whatsoever on which to enjoin a meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.220" offset="3696201">Professor Paul Floyd had said in a little excerpt from -- that we have in our brief, he speaks of the chilling effect that injunctions have in First Amendment rights and he says it particularly obtains, if disobedience of the interim order is ipso facto contempt with no opportunity to escape by showing invalidity of the order on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.191" offset="3784182">And as I say, there has been a chilling effect on political liberty in the United States because of these TROs in a large number of different cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.308" offset="3840606">And of course, if the appellants here rather than having been enjoined in advance by the Circuit Court had been prosecuted directly under the ordinances which were the basis for the injunction, there's no question whatsoever that if convicted, their convictions would necessarily have been reversed if it were necessary as it may well have been to have brought those criminal cases to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.674" offset="3966098">Certainly, since Stau and prior to Stau, they could have tested the constitutionality of these ordinances by violating them and could have raised as a defense in a criminal prosecution the ordinances' unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.189" offset="4044152">So, the crux of the denial in this case is that the right to enjoin your First Amendment rights was delayed because I think that that right is an immediate right and that its delay is tantamount to its denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.588" offset="4145716">And that the only way to exercise that right immediately, as one ought to be able to do, is to violate an unconstitutional and oppressive court order, again, as Justice Frankfurter said in order that's no different than a letter to a newspaper, then that route must be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.877" offset="4250833">And of course, the appellee speaks about the possibility of disorder or violence or incitement to violence, but that was mere speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.981" offset="4319274">They -- they had no reason to believe that there was going to be any outbreak of violence, can be based on the meeting held just the previous evening they had every reason to believe that the meeting was going to be perfectly peaceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.222" offset="4392312">So simply by it's asserting that there was a speculative possibility and very remote at that of disorder, they -- they still did not justify at all the issuance of the temporary restraining order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.645" offset="4609964">Yes, my position would still be no different, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.999" offset="4643401">Of course, the Alabama Supreme Court pointed to -- based their decision upon the decision of Mine Workers, the rule of law enunciated Mine Workers and as we have said, we don't believe that Mine Workers really has anything to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.103" offset="4755832">As Mr. Justice Goldberg has suggested, in re Green last term or the term before, I think it has seriously impaired the authority of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.239" offset="4796374">And there were earlier cases, the Gas and Coke Workers which we cite in our brief which allowed state injunctions to be -- to be violative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.811" offset="4842663">And Mine Workers, of course, is entirely different case because it had to do with the assertion of rights that were -- could be regulated by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.542" offset="4885504">It concerned a very, very complex problem of statutory interpretation, namely, whether the Norris-La Guardia Act applied in the situation where the Government stood in the role of the employer or owner or what have you and third, of course, it was in the context of an industrial dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.476" offset="4965230">But we think even in Mine Workers own terms that if this Court is going to give any credence to the -- to the Mine Workers' rule, that of the seven -- that of the nine justices that sat on the case, seven of them recognized that there was such a thing as an order which Mr. Justice Frankfurter called a frivolous void order as opposed to a substantial void order that could be violated with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.978" offset="5103261">Seven of the justices said there was such -- such an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.923" offset="5119039">Justices Black and Justice Douglas did not because they didn't think it was right for discussion in that particular case, but if there is any such thing as a frivolously void order, this order is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.973" offset="5199287">It was an order issued upon three unarguably unconstitutional ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.113" offset="5231783">It was a prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.398" offset="5240978">It was in the context of the impairment of First Amendments rights which stand high in our social order and whatever assertion of jurisdiction that the Circuit Court made was entirely frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.592" offset="5329690">There was no -- there was no question here of his having to -- have time to determine whether he had jurisdiction because it's perfectly clear that he had no jurisdiction whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.302" offset="5388622">And the appellee again suggests that, well, this was alright because if he had followed the orderly appellant procedures, he could've gotten -- he moved to quash in the -- in the Alabama Circuit Court, he could've gotten a -- if his motion to quash was denied and if he took a prompt appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court, he might have had this determination within a minimum, a minimum of 13 days assuming that both courts would decide the -- well, assuming the Alabama Supreme Court had decided the matter off the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.173" offset="5544103">I suggest there might be more than that, but in any case even if it was a day, this would be 14 days after the meeting was originally scheduled, but even if it were a day, I say that this delay is tantamount to a denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.163" offset="5603976">Our last point is that this is another one of those cases like Thompson v. Louisville and Carter versus Louisiana, where the record is so devoid of evidence that the conviction cannot stand and I think the record speaks so clearly for itself on that point and I spoke to him yesterday when I was reviewing the facts of the case that I will rest on the -- on our brief as well as the Government's brief as amicus curiae.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burke Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="1427.866" offset="5814836">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.788" offset="5838555">Most of Mr. Wulf's argument in this case raises questions that the Court need consider in this case only if Fields disobeyed the order that was issued by the Circuit Court of Jefferson County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.394" offset="5920998">So I would like to address myself to the last point that Mr. Wulf made which is whether or not Fields did disobey the order and so the questions and problems that come up if he did disobey the order whether those are really before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.769" offset="6018487">The pleadings in this case alleged that Fields was going to hold a specific public meeting at a certain address in Fairfield on the evening of October 11, 1961 and that that meeting had been announced by bills which were been flammatory nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.253" offset="6124335">It attached the copy of the bill which appears at record pages 3 and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.353" offset="6156831">The relief that was sought by the complaint which appears at record 3 was to enjoin and restrain the party in Fields from holding the said meeting at said time and place and from distributing said handbills in the City of Fairfield, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.634" offset="6229870">That was the relief sought by the restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.964" offset="6251186">The injunction that was issued was in those narrow terms, that appears on pages 5 and 6 of the record and was there a restraining order from -- against Fields from distributing further in the City of Fairfield handbills announcing such meeting until further orders of the court and from holding the meeting as announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.008" offset="6371453">The complaint did also allege not only that ordinances existed in the City of Fairfield prohibiting the distribution of handbills and the holding of the meeting without a permit but also as Mr. Wulf has said that the meeting was among other things calculated to create a disturbance, incite to riot, disturb the peace and disrupt peace in good order in the City of Fairfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.164" offset="6488064">The judgment of contempt that was entered by the District Court, which appears on page 8 of the record, did not make any findings of violation of the specific terms of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.156" offset="6552012">It -- only findings were in conclusory terms. It did not find that there was a distribution of the handbill covered by the order and it did not find that the meeting was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.431" offset="6633096">What it did find was that Fields and Lyons knew the terms of the injunction and willfully and contemptuously distributed literature and held or attempted to hold said meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.530" offset="6705507">The opening statements of counsel in the case did not really claim that a violation of the order was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.919" offset="6743019">The opening statement by Mr. Parsons was that Fields and Lyons came to the vicinity of the place where the meeting was scheduled, contacted the people there about the meeting and distributed literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.923" offset="6799026">It did not refer to having a meeting and it did not refer to the distribution of the handbills.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burke Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="1688.236" offset="6856286">The proof consisted of four witnesses and six exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.303" offset="6876557">The exhibits were a copy of the Thunderbolt which was the literature referred to and that appears on page 21 of the record, a rifled slug and three shotgun shells which were introduced, though they don't appear to have anything to do with the contempt and a copy of the handbill which was introduced and appears at page 42 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.729" offset="6974255">It was admitted, it is admitted, I think, that that handbill was not distributed after the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.708" offset="7006229">The witnesses were, first, Chester Poke who is a member of the Fairfield Police Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.432" offset="7045099">He testified that he saw Fields distributing a copy -- copies of the Thunderbolt in the vicinity of the place where the meeting was going to be held about half an hour before it was going to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.929" offset="7103091">And he testified that Fields was telling the people that were there that the meeting place had been changed to Lipscomb, Alabama which is outside of the jurisdiction of the court that issued this injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.582" offset="7161710">The arrest, Poke made the arrest, was based on these activities and none other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.533" offset="7189504">And in his testimony describing that the – Poke repeated again that Fields told the people there that the meeting had been called off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.452" offset="7233181">He also testified that there was no trouble and no literature distributed except the Thunderbolt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.318" offset="7268603">The next witness was another policeman who had arrested Lyons, his name is Mithso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.437" offset="7301099">He testified that he was there at the time before the meeting was to be held that Lyons was passing out copies of the Thunderbolt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.508" offset="7337357">Someone called an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.732" offset="7346343">He went across the street and arrested Lyons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.614" offset="7361808">The officer hadn't read the Thunderbolt at that time, Thunderbolt's in the record, Thunderbolt does not refer to the meeting at all and that's the only thing that was distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.088" offset="7415724">Mithso testified that there was no meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.316" offset="7432652">The next witness was, Clyde Morris, a member of the Bazemore Police who were called into assist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.648" offset="7462013">He served the injunction on Fields and informed Fields that he could not have the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.956" offset="7491166">He was present at the scene where the meeting was supposed to take place, but the only testimony he had about that was that there was a crowd there which included 15 -- 12 to 15 officers of the Bazemore Police Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.681" offset="7574131">Fields later testified, at page 49 of the record, that there were 40 to 50 police officers there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.283" offset="7608508">The final witness was Charles Wood.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.922" offset="7639019">He said a good crowd but he did not estimate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.066" offset="7659604">I think Fields testified that he passed out about 12 copies of the Thunderbolt and as I said that there were 40 policemen there, sizeable crowd in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.632" offset="7721880">Woods was a member of the Fairfield Police, testified that he saw the arrest, nothing more about the activities of Fields that he'd searched the car nearby and found these shells and about 100 copies of the Thunderbolt in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.598" offset="7789798">He did not see Fields do anything and Mithso and Woods were recalled to identify this -- the car that was searched as one in which Fields had been seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.068" offset="7847685">That was the total of the prosecution evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.780" offset="7862523">There was no evidence that the meeting was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.783" offset="7874539">There was no evidence the handbills were distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.686" offset="7890108">There was no evidence that Fields said anything to anyone except that the meeting had been moved to Lipscomb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.103" offset="7919783">There was no evidence that Lyons did anything at all except pass out copies of the Thunderbolt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.504" offset="7953429">The defense called four witnesses. Smithson who is Mayor of Fairfield, Fields, Mrs. Fields and a man named “Short”, who testified that he had gone to the -- to a meeting at Lipscomb that night after having been informed that the meeting place had been changed, that's at page 60 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.172" offset="8060008">In summation, this evidence, defense evidence, the prosecution evidence didn't prove any elements of the contempt that was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.421" offset="8105044">The defense evidence did not advance the cause of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.119" offset="8127822">The mayor testified nothing about what happened at the place of the meeting except that he did not know whether or not handbills were distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.124" offset="8175888">Fields testified that there was no meeting, that he went to the place of the meeting only to change the location.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.759" offset="8206399">He was not permitted in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.890" offset="8214967">They were surrounded by police officers but he did not intend to violate the order and that no handbills had been distributed after the order was issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.065" offset="8723623">A meeting that is held solely to call off that meeting I say is not covered by the injunction whether you call it a meeting or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.448" offset="8761135">The trial court did not find any evidence of the distribution of handbills at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.979" offset="8791333">In fact, it said that there was no evidence, page 72 of the record, “While there is no evidence that pamphlet was redistributed, the writ of injunction says distribute further handbills announcing such meetings as were distributed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.590" offset="8853713">Then he referred to the copy of the Thunderbolt which is in the record and which does not refer to the meeting at all said that he was impressed by the tone and the context of the paper that was admittedly distributed and I simply think that was an artifice on the part of someone to bring home a fact that the meeting was going to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.429" offset="8941066">Now, the trial court found that despite the fact that the only evidence was that Fields, when he distributed these copies of the Thunderbolt which did not refer to a meeting, the only evidence was that when he did that, he told the people he distributed to them that the meeting had been called off, it's going to be held in Lipscomb, Alabama where he had permission from the mayor to hold the meeting in public park.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.807" offset="9038555">And as I say that he -- one of the witnesses for the defense testified that he went over there to go to the meeting that was held.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.755" offset="13042395">It's our holding that the Court is not going to depart from the principle that an injunction issued by a court having general jurisdiction with equity powers in which your -- they're -- jurisdictions has been aroused or raised by a proper application and in which the parties are before the Court and the subject matter is before the Court that the Court is not -- this Court is not going to see it in such an event that the persons served with the injunction and against to whom the injunction or is -- is directed don't have to in -- or to obey the injunction if they believe in their minds that it -- that the -- the thing enjoined or the act of injunction or the -- the laws out of what the injunction comes are unconstitutional or affect their First Amendment rights or any other rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.827" offset="13254719">To us, that is a dangerous proposition that is urged upon the Court here because to us, it appears that you are then saying to each man or each person, you be the judge of whether or not -- of what is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.348" offset="13320756">And of course, this Court has reserved to itself the question of what is the law and to say to a person that he or she may decide for himself what is the law is to an effect, make no law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.601" offset="13373733">To carry that reasoning on, the criminal might say, “Well, this criminal law in its -- in this particular situation that I find myself is inapplicable to me and I will go ahead and break the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.799" offset="13434546">We have anarchy but we have no law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.950" offset="13443218">Now, this -- the -- the Supreme Court of Alabama, in deciding this case or -- or decided it on the basis of the Mine Workers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.512" offset="13485432">It also decided, as was mentioned here, on the proposition that this is a certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.817" offset="13510614">It was -- the matter was before them on certiorari, that in certiorari, it would only go into the question of law, the question of the jurisdiction of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.839" offset="13542693">Of course that involved a question of whether or not there were sufficient facts to uphold the finding of -- of contempt and the Court said that in its judgment there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.506" offset="13589400">So I want to point out to you to Your Honors, to the Court here that the finding of the Alabama Supreme Court which is appealed to this Court was based on these two propositions of general law and not upon a proposition involving a federal question, either of interpretation of the Federal Constitution or the interpretation of federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.718" offset="13686262">And that -- therefore, under the authority of Lee versus Thomas, Lee versus Thomas which said that the general well settled rule is that the case coming from a State -- any case coming from a state court, the Supreme Court can consider only federal questions and it can entertain -- it cannot entertain the case unless the decision was against the -- the plaintiff and they are on these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.000" offset="13771421">And that is further been applied in cases where it was said that if -- if the finding of the Court is based upon several propositions of one of which is a proposition of general law not involving a federal question and if that proposition standing alone which supports the finding of the Court and that this Court would not entertain the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.730" offset="13858252">We suggest that that -- for that reason, the Court should leave the findings of the Supreme Court of Alabama and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama where it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="4248.619" offset="17097853">It's -- it's to say -- the Alabama Supreme Court did quote from its own opinion in NAACP versus Alabama without noting that it had been reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.442" offset="17145187">But I think that is somewhat different because what this Court said in NAA versus Alabama was that this was a rule of law in the civil contempt context that the NAA case came up and -- that had never before been applied and that the petitioner there had been adequately forewarned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.307" offset="17248632">I can only repeat what I've already said that the appellees, City of Fairfield's claim that all they were doing here was trying to maintain the peace and good order of the City of Fairfield is hardly -- is no justification whatsoever for the suppression of the meeting which is at issue here and the right of the appellants to exercise and enjoy their First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.942" offset="17363153">If the courts had -- Court has no further questions, I -- best time I'd reason other argument.</text>
