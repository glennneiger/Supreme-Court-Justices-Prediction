            <text syncTime="60.256" offset="344377">Our position is first that the question has become moot because there is no controversy, that there is no adversity that the relief sought cannot be granted and second that the District Court did not err in denying the accused a preliminary examination and third that the vagrancy laws are not vague, does not penalize our status and that the vagrancy laws have generally been held to be constitution and fourth that no federal question was presented, because no writ of habeas corpus was properly presented to any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.567" offset="533608">Now Your Honors, I think that this case should be presented to Your Honors on the record and we should stick to the record and the record consists of an affidavit which was made against the accused charging him with vagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.506" offset="625351">That there was a warrant issued for his arrest, a valid warrant issued for his arrest, a valid affidavit made out charging him with vagrancy of crime in the State of Louisiana and that he was found near a structure without being able to account for his presence therein, that was a motion for a preliminary examination made on his behalf by counsel, that after that the state filed a bill of information against the accused based upon the affidavit and based on the same offence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.470" offset="7065266">Coming to the point the question of the vagrancy statute, incidentally I just wanted to stress the point that after the District Attorney files a Bill of Information that the accused is no longer entitled as a matter of right to a preliminary examination and that is reason why the Judge recalled his order for a preliminary examination and we do it all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.126" offset="7183862">The reason simply is that we don't want to try the case twice when the case is coming up in the near future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.096" offset="7207790">In this particular case the next couple of weeks we would have been fall, we would be having a misdemeanor week and then also in the view of the fact that we don't prosecute on affidavits that was the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.779" offset="7270484">Now, I have to go to the vagrancy statute, I have cited cases that show in that, that it's within the police power of the state to enact these vagrancy statutes and that they are passed to prevent crimes that may have flow from vagrancy ways of actions all their life that there is no cases which was cited by the appellant that vagrancy statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.497" offset="7397334">This one here, the part he is attacking of course is only that part of the statute which provides that no person may be found in here any structure, movable vessel or private grounds without being able to account for their lawful presence they are in, and of course this prevents people from, say lie and awake in a building or structure would be intended to commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.741" offset="7510288">The statutes have been held to be constitutional or valid exercise of police power of the states in the main because these statutes have been upheld as constitutional, as a matter of fact is one in this in the District of Columbia which is very similar to Louisiana's Statute.</text>
