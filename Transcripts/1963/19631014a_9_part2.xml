          <turn speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="34.309" stopTime="521.383">
            <label>Ms. Constance Baker Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="34.309" offset="240619">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.979" offset="259323">Before this Court for review upon the granting of a writ of certiorari is the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirming the convictions of petitioners for trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.391" offset="324942">That law, Section 16-386, by its terms makes it a misdemeanor to enter upon the lands of another after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.207" offset="404250">The Negro petitioners in this case are Columbia, South Carolina college students, who were arrested on March 16th, 1960 when they went into Eckerds Drug Store, a large multi-department chain store, the only department of which -- which is restricted to whites is the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.035" offset="503515">The petitioner seated themselves in a booth in the lunch counter and the owner asked them to leave and the police officer asked them to leave and after a few minutes hesitation, one got up, the other was attempting to get up and he was pulled up by the police officer, and they were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.915" offset="587003">Petitioners were tried in the Recorder's Court in the City of Columbia without a jury on March 25th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.116" offset="619813">They were convicted of trespass and sentenced to pay a fine of $100, $24.50 of which was suspended or 30 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.778" offset="666520">Their convictions were affirmed by the Richmond County Court Criminal Division and by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.377" offset="700897">Throughout the state court proceedings, petitioners claimed that their arrest and convictions violated rights secured to them by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses for the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.373" offset="776861">Petitioners urged that their convictions amounted to state enforcement of private racial segregation to the use of the state's judicial machinery to enforce such discrimination in a public place where -- where petitioners have been invited to trade and where they had the right to be and that this action singled them out for different treatment by the state solely because of their race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.536" offset="897546">These contentions were summarily overruled by the Supreme Court of South Carolina on the ground that similar contentions have been rejected by it in a similar case, City of Greenville against Peterson, which was reversed here last term on other ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.188" offset="980093">Upon this review, petitioners contend first that their rights have been violated because here, the state's criminal law enforcement and judicial machinery were employed to sanction and enforce private racial discrimination in a place open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.863" offset="1082807">Every member of the public could go into this place and every white member of the public could sit at the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.794" offset="1114572">Secondly, petitioners claim that their rights have been violated because the state is involved in this act of racial discrimination, because it's an act performed by the manager of Eckerds Drug Store in obedience to a community wide custom of racial segregation in public-eating places, which custom in turn is dictated in part by a state law and massively supported and encouraged by a network of corresponding state laws clearly defining that state's long pursued policy of enforcing racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.200" offset="1292204">Not only in the public life of the state, but in private affairs as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.827" offset="1314670">Thirdly, petitioners claim that their rights have been violated because, contrary to the command of the Fourteenth Amendment that no state shall deny equal protection of the laws, South Carolina has denied the same by a regime of laws, which fails to furnish such protection to petitioners by subordinating petitioner's claim to equality in the public facilities of the community to a narrow and technical property claim, which is no more than an assertion of their right to deny equal treatment to Negroes in one department of a store open to any member of the white public.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.078" offset="1503692">Now, the gravamen of this case was put before the arresting officer in a single question, which appears on page 17 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.959" offset="1547160">The arresting officer was the Assistant Chief of Police and he was asked this, "Chief, isn't it a fact that the only reason you are called in from the police department to arrest these two persons was because they were Negroes who are asking for service in the food department of Eckerds store.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.131" offset="1623855">And the manager was directing them out because they were Negroes, isn't that correct?"</text>
            <text syncTime="385.313" offset="1644648">And the chief answered, "Why, certainly," I would think that would be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.416" offset="1665024">Consequently, there is no question in this case that the policy of Eckerds Drug Store was to permit Negroes to trade in all of the numerous departments of the store except the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.298" offset="1720613">At one point, the manager of the drug store testified that he did not refuse to serve petitioners because they were Negroes, that's on page 26, but when he realized that he's previously admitted, an obvious policy would not permit him on the cross examination to evade the crucial issue as to why service was denied, he asserted all stores do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.646" offset="1841925">It is also clear that the manager's refusal to serve therefore was influenced by community custom, which we claim amounts to unconstitutional state action because dictated in part by state law and supported by a massive state segregation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.472" offset="1945266">Constitutionally relevant here, is the fact that this community-wide custom of not serving Negro and white persons together in public-eating places in South Carolina is expressly dictated in part by a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.384" offset="2008900">At the turn of the century when public-eating places were largely the concern of people traveling, South Carolina made it a crime to furnish meals to white and colored persons in the same room, at the same table or at the same counter in station restaurants or station eating houses, in times limited by common carriers of such passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.722" offset="2126242">And then, in Peterson versus City of Louisville, the case which was here the last term, there was a South Carolina city ordinance in Greenville, which expressly required segregation in restaurants.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.222" offset="2184234">In addition --</text>

            <label>Ms. Constance Baker Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="589.078" offset="2459669">That's right, that's right and then as I've said, this custom which was dictated in part by state law and that it expressed the state's policy with respect to public eating in a certain area was again massively supported and has been for almost a century by South Carolina statutes, which created the segregated society presently existing in that state because the state not only decreed segregation in the public life, and facilities owned and operated by the state but in a facilities owned and operated by private individuals as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.158" offset="2647960">And as we point out in our brief, during reconstruction, there is historical evidence that Negroes were able to eat in public-eating places in Columbia, South Carolina, the same city involved here and as way as 1895 and 1898, there was opposition in South Carolina to the enactment of racist legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.588" offset="2741687">However, it is obvious that the pro-segregation forces prevailed and after a brief, desegregated reconstruction era, the policy of South Carolina changed and became that of segregation of the races as we've said as evidenced by these numerous laws, which requires segregation in such places, in circuses, in traveling shows, steamed ferries, carrier stations, restaurants, textile factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.574" offset="2857671">In other words, the state extended its policy beyond the public life into private affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3599.071" offset="14499610">What the primary interest of the state and a trespasser we submit is keeping the peace, because if the owner goes to self-help, a breach of the peace will occur, at least a breach in the layman sense is going to be bias and the state's interest in enforcing a trespass law, is to prevent the necessity for the owner having to go to self- help and to keep the peace and those interests have nothing to do with racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.905" offset="14614967">And we submit that when the state comes in, in these cases, the discrimination has occurred and they are simply enforcing the criminal law, which itself is color blind and applies to all in removing these people from the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.578" offset="14673690">If you hold otherwise, the effect is going to be, it seems to me to say that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits -- permits one to violate the criminal law of the state without being prosecuted if at the time he's violating that law he is being racially discriminated against by another private individual, which we submit has never been the law until now.</text>

            <text syncTime="4220.281" offset="16984482">It's -- that is where -- that's our case is what we submit here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.009" offset="16999424">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.690" offset="17010082">In conclusion, it's -- it's our position that -- that there has been no state participation in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.868" offset="17042892">The state's interest is solely that of the peace and if you hold of that interest itself is --is prohibited state action, then I believe you're -- you're turning these proprietors loose on a self-help situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.363" offset="17096808">They are in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.091" offset="17103705">They are in this business for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.361" offset="17112795">I think that's quite often overlooked and they are bound by the wishes of the public, by the customers and of course, no decree of this Court will change that view overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.572" offset="17153651">The -- the -- the proprietor himself quite frequently has no -- doesn't care, but he's in this thing to make money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.276" offset="17184475">That is the problem he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.463" offset="17189177">We thank you for your time.</text>
