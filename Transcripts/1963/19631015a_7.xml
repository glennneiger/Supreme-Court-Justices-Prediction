            <text syncTime="11.404" offset="148982">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.322" offset="156609">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, while this case involves many profound considerations of constitutional law, at this stage of the proceeding, we are concerned only with the matter of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.378" offset="240933">The question basically is, what is the proper procedure for a three-judge federal court, which has entertained an action, raising questions of the constitutionality of a state statute under the Federal Constitution when it has remanded the parties to the state courts to secure a state court interpretation of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="73.750" offset="398399">The question as to procedure is, shall the parties be required to come to this Court for review of the state court decision or may they return to the District Court to complete the litigation in the first place?</text>
            <text syncTime="94.379" offset="480841">This case was brought by a large group of chiropractors in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.839" offset="510725">It was initiated in May of 1957 for the purpose of securing a judgment that the State Medical Practice Act was first, inapplicable to chiropractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.208" offset="588152">Second, that it was unconstitutional in administration and finally that as drafted and as applied, the statute itself was a denial of rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution besides the Privileges and Immunities Clause, but basically, Fourteenth Amendment rights are here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.137" offset="707897">The District Court declined to prorogue a three-judge District Court as was requested and ruled that because there was no diversity of citizenship and because there was no serious question of constitution or law, which had not been settled, the Court was without jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.761" offset="798386">That was the decision of the District Court declining to convene a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.847" offset="822732">An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and that court, by a divided bench, ruled that the complaint made out some cause of action and alleged a prima facie case of constitutional rights which had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.791" offset="910503">Motion for rehearing was made and was the occasion for the courts writing a very extended discussion of the grounds by which the reversal was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.360" offset="956792">Accordingly, in the District Court, a three-judge bench was convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.771" offset="986467">The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on a basis of voluminous documentation and information of a medical and scientific nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.709" offset="1038190">The court heard oral argument on all these points from both sides and without consultation or notice of any kind, proceeded to announce that it would abstain from passing upon the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.256" offset="1124394">Some 27 years before, the state courts had decided that this docket was constitutional in an attack of somewhat limited but similar nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.389" offset="2752972">Now, there was a time in the early history of the country when the relative weight and functions of the state judiciary and the federal judiciary was not clearly expounded and understood and so we had such case as Cohens against Virginia in which the defendants or the appellants by writ of error had been convicted of selling lottery tickets under an act of Congress in the State of Virginia and they claimed that they were protected by the fact that Congress had enacted this statute and that they could therefore proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.711" offset="2898213">Now, the State of Virginia and its authority said that the federal court had no authority whatsoever to review the convictions of the Virginia court and Mr. Justice Marshall in a very learned and helpful decision, which has a direct bearing here, said that we have this question of judicial power of the Federal Government, refers to the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.848" offset="2994761">This is the supreme law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.900" offset="3003016">And therefore, the federal courts are vested with authority to inquire into any action taken under authority of the States to determine whether or not that state action measures up to the requirements of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.121" offset="3063829">Having decided that they had jurisdiction, they went on to decide that Congress had never authorized the sale of lottery tickets in violation of any state law in the appearance of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.226" offset="3104266">But that was, we might say, an original inquiry by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall into the role of the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.580" offset="3137703">Now, having established that judicial power, granted under the Constitution, extends to a review of all action taken under state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.476" offset="3189321">The Congress, he then found, had created these inferior judicial courts and invested them with authority to pass upon questions of constitutional right asserted as a bar to state court action or any state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.109" offset="3255777">When that happened, we went on from there to Martin against Hunter's Lessee, which was decided by Justice Story and later on to a variety of other cases, which are cited in the brief and in which Mr. Justice Story says, in effect, Congress could not vest the state courts with authority to pass upon a federal constitutional right asserted under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.192" offset="3376149">Now, when this action was brought, Mr. Justice Goldberg, in the state court, I beg your pardon, in the federal court, in the District Court, it was an attempt to vindicate a federal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.393" offset="3432991">Certainly, it was brought under a precise federal statute which said in so many words, jurisdiction shall be vested in the federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.469" offset="3469249">That's exactly what the statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.422" offset="3477086">We've cited the chapter and verse of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.745" offset="3490356">Now, the federal court after the remand, mind you, from the Fifth Circuit, was faced with a binding decision, which was the law of the case at that point, to the effect that this complaint set forth a valid cause of action under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.735" offset="3582307">Instead of proceeding to judgment on the motion for summary judgment, which the plaintiffs had every legal right to ask under the Constitution and under the statute, they said, "We feel that since 27 years has elapsed since the earlier decision, we should not take it for granted that the state of chiropractic hasn't developed and that the understanding of the State of Louisiana hasn't changed and we feel we should have a current interpretation of the state statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="902.026" offset="3711457">They also said, and this is, of course, in the record that it may be that the state court will find that chiropractic as chiropractic is not embraced within this Medical Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.107" offset="3763806">Therefore, we won't ever have to reach a constitutional decision or they may find that it doesn't apply to chiropractics and should not apply to chiropractics and that the people who administer the Act are acting outside the scope of their authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.896" offset="12394977">No, no, but on a basis of the information available to us at the time, it seemed proper to go into the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.583" offset="12425697">I still think that as a matter of policy, this Court would prefer that this Court shouldn't be burdened with unnecessary petitions for certiorari in appeals if the District Court can dispose them, especially, if Your Honors please, since the district courts will undoubtedly resolve and narrow the issues that must be brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.143" offset="12499989">Why this Court have its docket up with cases that have just been decided by the state courts probably in a diffused decision, which doesn't specialized by federal exposition but upon the state law and the facts maybe unsettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.358" offset="12556831">Whereas, if you go on to the Federal District Court, proper practice of law would enable you to present for the court's decision, requested findings of fact and conclusions of law on which we could take with appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.278" offset="12608449">Now, in this case at bar, counsel has said even if the doctrine of abstention means nothing or it means that the state court decision is binding, binding, on the federal courts, well, this would mean an abnegation of judicial authority as Mr. Justice Frankfurter referred to it in the Thibodaux case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.098" offset="12683786">However, we don't expect anything like that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.158" offset="12696012">This is just a matter of clarifying the state law on which the state court is the final and conclusive authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.239" offset="12724328">In the Leiter case, which is cited in a case cited by the other side, Leiter Minerals against United States, the Court said, “The state court must decide these questions so that -- but they can only decide questions within their competence."</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.506" offset="12793396">It's a case of rendering (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.988" offset="12803323">If you have a federal question, that must be decided in the federal courts, and if it's a state law question, in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.019" offset="12831431">Now, we've been asked, what's our prejudice?</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.776" offset="12842506">We have never been afforded a decision by a federal forum on a question of federal constitutional right which arises under the Constitution of the United States and the Civil Rights Act, which is the basis on which this action is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.680" offset="12906141">We feel we're entitled to that decision by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.569" offset="12921605">We feel too that to say that the decision of the state court is binding, it's simply a -- an utter abnegation of judicial authority by the lower federal courts.</text>
