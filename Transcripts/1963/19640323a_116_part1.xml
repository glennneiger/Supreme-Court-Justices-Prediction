            <text syncTime="125.772" offset="606438">Now, I want to point out to the Court that first, I should say that I'm going in the interest of saving time since this is on a summary calendar to skip the procedural steps which resulted in this case once before having come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.625" offset="677909">I think it's unnecessary to any of the substantive issues now presented to discuss that in anywise.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.562" offset="705599">But what is ultimately at stake in this litigation is no less than the right of the States to license and regulation, the distribution and sale of intoxicating liquors.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.417" offset="757008">And I think I need hardly remind this Court that by now, in the year 1964, there was no question whatever of the unique and special status of liquors.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.542" offset="801520">Now, constitutionally and from the whole history of legislative and judicial decision and development, it's quite clear that liquor is in a class by itself and not to be treated for purposes of the Commerce Clause or otherwise in the same category as such ordinary commodities as oil, milk and anything else that one might think of.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.877" offset="886888">And more specifically, the question here is whether the State of New York may constitutionally apply its liquor licensing requirements to the appellee's resale liquor operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.927" offset="947075">And very briefly, I'd like to summarize what those operations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.739" offset="966301">The plaintiff -- the appellee is a New York corporation which maintains its office and principal place of business at what was known as the Idlewild and is now the Kennedy International Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.849" offset="1014784">It maintained its private office or shop -- its principal shop on the second floor of the arrival's building at the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.758" offset="1050415">It also has and that the start of this litigation had selling counters at the Pan American and TWA counters within the airport.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.829" offset="1166712">Since then, they have already opened to our knowledge at least one place in the East Side Airlines Terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.529" offset="1193462">That's over in the borough of Manhattan.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.553" offset="1201612">And that's a place from which conveyances can bring passengers to the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.895" offset="1227003">And that's very important, Mr. Justice Stewart if I may say so because this is not on federal territory, even that portion which is in the airport is not on federally ceded territory, but even more important, since the appellee suggests that it had some sort of federal license or federal authorization from the Customs Department, from the Customs people.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.046" offset="1331597">This is a very strange thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.348" offset="1340792">The opening of this new sales outlet at the East Side Airlines Terminal points to the fact that if they're correct in their contention, what is to stop this plaintiff alone from opening outlets throughout the State of New York absolutely unregulated, unsupervised, unlicensed and untouchable by the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.499" offset="5153416">Now, the contention here is -- is as to the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses and for the wedge in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.948" offset="5195212">The plaintiffs attempt to use Section 311 of the Tariff Act of 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.347" offset="5216737">Now, Your Honors know that's simply a tax exemption statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1293.411" offset="5277027">And we've had this question in the case that's cited here, the American Travelers Club, a different three-judge statutory court in the same southern district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.546" offset="5309524">We've cited it in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.579" offset="5317674">Now, I think that both the plaintiffs and the court below certainly overlooked the unique constitutional status of liquors on the -- the Twenty-first Amendment under such acts as the Wilson, Webb-Kenyon, Federal Alcoholic Administration Act and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.660" offset="5386010">Those -- those statues, time doesn't permit it, but there at page 34 of our brief, even if we didn't have the Twenty-first Amendment, I would think both from the judicial history of interpretation of those statutes and from the language of the statutes themselves that it would be inconceivable that this operation could be set up as it has been in New York and with the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.366" offset="5476812">Of course, the Twenty-first Amendment absolutely prohibits any operations in violation of state law where there is use for delivery of liquor within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.945" offset="5527176">Now, there are undoubtedly has been, if we need to go so far as the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.946" offset="5551208">Unquestionably, there is use in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.142" offset="5563956">First, there's delivery, the liquors were delivered to them in the State of New York, sold to them as the sale to them first from the wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.972" offset="5595303">Then there is use -- they're stored in New York, there is solicitation, there were sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.389" offset="5616933">If this be not use, then I don't know what this clear and explicit language of the Twenty-first Amendment could possibly refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.784" offset="5654549">Now, there are many Supreme Court cases and many decisions of this Court in which it hold that under Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment, the State power cannot, when it comes to liquor traffic, be limited by the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.934" offset="5719124">And there are many cases to that effect beginning with the State Board against Young's case in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.617" offset="5749844">Not long after the Amendment, a series of cases came into this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.807" offset="5766562">The Twenty-first Amendment was construed and construed no uncertain terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.610" offset="5785788">And it -- there were cases later on after these series of cases that we've mentioned State Boards, Ziffrin, Mahoney and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.796" offset="5818598">There were cases such as Duckworth and Carter which involve simply transportation through a State where this Court did not find it necessary to reach the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.021" offset="5855483">Although some concurring justices, like Mr. Justice Jackson and Mr. Justice Frankfurter, thought that the Twenty-first should been -- should have been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.104" offset="5887770">But I should think that if there was any question as to the applicability of the Twenty-first Amendment, the situations of the kind we have at bar, they certainly will lay finally to rest by this Court's 1958 decisions in California against Washington and even more appropriate, Gordon against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.879" offset="5970840">It's true those were first, two or three line per curiam opinions but they were -- they cited the Twenty-first Amendment very significantly and they allowed that none of their force by the fact that they were short per curiam opinions.</text>
