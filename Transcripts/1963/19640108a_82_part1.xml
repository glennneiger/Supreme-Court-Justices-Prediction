            <text syncTime="14.429" offset="161102">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.415" offset="176985">My name is Erskine B. Wood, from Portland, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.131" offset="187852">I represent the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.073" offset="199659">I have as much -- I have a great deal of difficulty pronouncing its name.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.538" offset="213556">I usually called it the Italian Line for short.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.371" offset="236857">This is a case in the maritime field involving the question of rights of indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.094" offset="271757">These are the ship operators and their contracting stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.155" offset="295999">The -- specifically, it involves those rights with respect to defective equipment brought aboard a vessel by the contracting stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.790" offset="350542">Now, Your Honors recall that this matter of the shipowners or operators recovering indemnity over against their contracting stevedores has been the subject of quite a line of decisions in this case -- in this Court starting with the case of Ryan Stevedore Company against Pan-Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.952" offset="443225">And that was followed by Weyerhaeuser versus Nacirema and Crumady against the S.S. Joachim Fisser and Waterman against Dugan &amp; McNamara.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.257" offset="492440">All of those are decisions by this Court within the last few years dealing with this general topic of indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.798" offset="526608">And in those cases, the Court has spelled out the doctrine of indemnification as being one that is based on contract, based on the theory that the contracting stevedore, when it undertakes by contract to do the stevedoring work onboard, the vessel, impliedly warrants that it will do the work in a workmanlike manner and will not render a substandard service.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.770" offset="646457">And the Court has said that that is an implied -- a warranty implied in fact and it is comparable to a manufacturer's warranty of the soundness of its product and that competency in safety of stowage are at the very essence of the service undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.310" offset="728586">Now, that's the -- just the general background of the field that we are in.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.629" offset="749902">Now, the cases that have been expressly decided by this Court on indemnity, have involved acts of negligence on the part of the stevedore, that is human error committed by the stevedore's employees rather than the furnishing of defective equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.833" offset="842689">The case at bar, however, involves a case where the stevedore company in pursuance of its stevedoring work on the ship, brought aboard and used in connection with its work a -- a piece of rope that was unfit and defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.421" offset="921057">Now, the facts -- the specific facts of this particular case are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.903" offset="946970">The stevedore company was doing work on the petitioner's vessel on Portland, Oregon and it was doing this work under a contract which provided that the stevedore would furnish all ordinary gear required in the work and all labors and supervision and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.337" offset="1020740">And as a part of the work and as a part of that contract, they furnished an ordinary canvass rain tent, that is simply a tent to protect the cargo from getting wet from rain.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.659" offset="1097958">Now, attached to this tent are what they call tie-down ropes.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.933" offset="1123140">They're simply a -- a short length of rope, that is big around as a person's thumb to tie the end of the tent down, keep it from ripping around.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.031" offset="1163473">And one of these ropes was defective and as a result, one of the longshoremen, who is the employee of the stevedore contractor in pulling on this rope, it broke and he fell to the deck and sustained injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.054" offset="1239542">The longshoreman sued the shipowner, the petitioner here, in the state court and recovered a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.095" offset="1275800">The shipowner then sued originally in admiralty in the District Court to recover indemnification over and against the stevedore who had brought the tent aboard and furnished the (Inaudible) did not specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.574" offset="1393664">However, there was no evidence in any way to connect and to charge any negligence on the part of the shipowner because they had no control over this rope.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.534" offset="1449462">The rope was supplied by the stevedore contractor, brought aboard and it remains continually in the stevedore's (Inaudible) presented but it was a general verdict and in the complaint -- and I think -- I think Your Honor it's actually submitted on a basis to the jury, in that case, on the basis of both unseaworthiness and negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.644" offset="1801906">And based on the evidence in the case, the District Judge found that they had overcome inferences and negligence, and he found specifically that the stevedore contractor had not been negligent that this was a -- a latent defective -- latently defective rope that they had furnished.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.921" offset="2451101">Now, in approaching this question, I want to first call attention to the legal background because when we consider questions whether an implied warranty exists, we have to view that in relation to all the facts, the circumstances and the -- the background of the law, the general background of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.765" offset="2778467">Now -- so therefore, you can see that what occurs in this case is that when the stevedore contractor brings equipment aboard in the course of its work which is defective and unfit for the purpose for which it's to be used and that breaks and causes injury to one of the stevedore's own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.077" offset="2867702">The stevedore in effect is visited or imposed the liability on the ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.367" offset="3004792">In these Circuits, there are only two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.181" offset="3020048">The -- the Second Circuit in the case of Booth against Meier &amp; Oelhaf decided this precise issue in accordance with what we urge.</text>

            <text syncTime="749.066" offset="3099669">But -- there was no negligence on the part of the contractor but it was lately defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.462" offset="3117223">It broke, one of the contractor's workman was injured, recovered against the vessel owner upon the -- its absolute warranty of fitness of the gear and the Court of Appeals held that the shipowner was entitled to full indemnity against the stevedore contractor based upon the theory of an implied warranty of the fitness of the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.305" offset="3244596">And actually the Court of Appeals, I think wrote a very strong and well recent opinion which I can almost submit in -- in lieu of my whole argument here because the -- the issues are squarely raised in that opinion, that's a very well recent opinion in our judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.378" offset="3324844">Now, the -- in the present case, the Ninth Circuit decided the case against the implied warranty by two-to-one.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.456" offset="3373223">The majority Justices Barnes and Hamlin felt that they did not want to extend the stevedore contractor's liability beyond ordinary negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.731" offset="3430275">They reached that result, we think or a rather strained and narrow construction of this Court's opinion in Ryan in the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.077" offset="3471653">They mentioned that this Court has frequently referred to the warranty of workmanlike service as being the warranty owed by the contracting stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.654" offset="3510000">And they said from that that they looked up dictionary definitions of the word "workmanlike" and they went into a question of semantics and the acquainted workmanlike with skillful adopt and things of that nature and therefore, they seem to think that the only warranty was one against negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.814" offset="3614595">Justice Jertberg dissented, he would follow the Booth case in the Second Circuit saying that -- it -- it was only fair as between these two parties that since that it was the stevedore that brought the equipment aboard and subjected the vessel owner to liability that the stevedore should bear the ultimate loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.418" offset="3693066">He also comments on the placing the risk, ultimate risk on the party best able to avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.732" offset="3730265">Now, in my argument, I wish to make essentially three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.491" offset="3757328">The first point really is that, although this Court has not exactly decided this precise question, the -- the result for which -- which we urge has been foreshadowed by numerous statements in the opinions of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.168" offset="3820022">Secondly, that just as a simple matter of fairness, the stevedore should owe this warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.672" offset="3842069">And thirdly, as a matter of policy to prevent injuries or minimize injuries, the ultimate risk ought to be placed on the stevedore contractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.103" offset="4291793">Now, first of all, I want to discuss briefly the -- my point that the decisions of this Court have indicated or foreshadowed the result from which we -- which we urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.523" offset="4361488">In Ryan and all of the cases subsequent to that, it has been repeatedly stated that the stevedore's warranty is based in contract and it's not in any way based on the tort and that theories of active and passive negligence and things of that sort have no application in this field of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.012" offset="4471411">Secondly, this Court has said that the warranty owed by the stevedore is -- and I quote "comparable."</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.120" offset="4503803">I -- I may not exactly quote, but it's comparable to the warranty owed by a manufacturer of products as to the soundness of its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.195" offset="4540165">And the Court -- the Court's noticed it and -- and as it intended to say that warranty of a manufacturer as to the soundness of its product is an absolutely warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.255" offset="4588440">It is no defense to the manufacturer to say that it was not negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.063" offset="4611636">The warrant is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.169" offset="4624071">In fact, even under the -- not only manufacturers but sellers under the Uniform Sales Act where they sell an article to a buyer and the buyer is relying upon the judgment and experience of the seller, they sell him a proper article, and the seller knows the purpose for which the article is going to be used by the seller, owes an absolute warranty of -- that is reasonably fit, reasonably suitable for the purpose intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.869" offset="4754892">Now -- and it's a -- it's kind of a funny thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.099" offset="4775790">I think to some extent, this Court adopted the rule in Ryan perhaps by assuming the very proposition that we urge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.969" offset="4839215">The Government's brief -- amicus brief in Ryan referred to this various cases of warranties by the manufacturer, warranties by sellers and the warranty by a supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.775" offset="4894490">And I think from -- from that warranty which was pretty well accepted, was urging this Court to adopt the principle that the stevedore also owed a warranty as to its services and there's a passage in the opinion of this Court in the Ryan case which says -- says this, "A light result occurs where a shipowner sues for breach of warranty a supplier of defective ship's gear that has caused injury or death to a longshoreman using it in the course of his employment on shipboard."</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.979" offset="5055300">Now, that of course is exactly the present case where we had -- we have now a shipowner suing the contracting stevedore who supplied defective gear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.934" offset="5099081">So perhaps in Ryan, the Court was relying upon -- generally assuming the result for which we urge and then expanding that into the -- the service warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.727" offset="5146311">Now, more important though than these indications because I realized that it's hard to take single sentences and quotations out of context, that is the case of Reed against Yaka.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.121" offset="5203884">Now, Reed against Yaka was decided by this Court only last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.922" offset="5223111">The decision was in May.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.786" offset="5234500">And you recall that -- that case didn't involve the precise issue here but the reasoning by which the majority of the Court reached its result, assumed the correctness of the proposition which we are now urging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.774" offset="5314435">Now, I'll explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.697" offset="5318196">In Reed against Yaka, the longshoreman had been injured by his foot going through a wooden pallet board that was defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.500" offset="5381413">That had been furnished and brought aboard as in the present case by the stevedore company who is the employer of Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.973" offset="5419238">Now, the -- the unusual thing and -- and the thing that presented the problem to this Court in Reed against Yaka was that the stevedore employer of the man and the ship operator where one and the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.148" offset="5479946">The Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company had chartered this ship, was operating it as a bareboat charter in this -- in the position of an owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.013" offset="5519444">But they also had a stevedoring department and so this man was their own employee and the question was really -- was a procedural one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.480" offset="5569285">The question is whether the injured longshoreman could maintain a libel in rem against the vessel without a corresponding or supporting in personam liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.389" offset="5624978">And so the Court examined the question whether there would be a separate in personam liability on the part of this company that in effect was wearing two hats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.009" offset="5679417">It was operating the ship but also had a stevedoring department and employed the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.734" offset="5698330">And of course the big question was whether in that situation, the injured man could sue a party who albeit, it was operating the ship was at the same time a stevedored company and his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.242" offset="5768338">And we have the Longshoreman and Harbored Workers' Compensation Act that said that that liability under the Act for compensation was exclusive and it was on that ground that Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart dissented because of the provisions for Longshoreman and Harbored Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.141" offset="5863946">But now, in reaching the result in Reed against Yaka, the majority said -- they -- they assumed that the correctness of the proposition that we are now urging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.589" offset="5913684">In Reed against Yaka, it was a latent defect and the findings of the District Court specifically and expressly said that the sole cause of injury was latent defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.509" offset="5953390">There was no negligence on anybody's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.393" offset="5964988">That's in the District Court's findings and it's repeated in this Court's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.273" offset="5980453">Then this Court said, well, if the -- there had been a -- a separate shipowner and an independent contractor stevedore, why there is no doubt at all that the man could have recovered against the shipowner for the defective equipment onboard the vessel and the ship operator in turn under Ryan, could then have placed the ultimate loss upon the stevedore contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.949" offset="6103124">The -- the Court's precise words on that are as follow, "Thus, there can be no doubt that if the petitioner here had been employed to do this particular work by an independent stevedoring company rather than directly by the owner, he could have recovered damages for his injury from the owner who could have then under Ryan shift to the burden of recovery to petitioner's stevedoring employer."</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.885" offset="6214928">And a little bit later, the Court said, "In either case under Ryan, the burden ultimately falls on the company who's the fault cause the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.001" offset="6247424">So there -- really, I think the Court assumed the correctness of the proposition we urged and --</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.605" offset="6641768">In Reed against Yaka, the owner of the ship was the Waterman Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.476" offset="6661308">They had -- they're both chartered to Pan-Atlantic as a ship operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.910" offset="6683042">Pan-Atlantic had a stevedore department and employed the injured man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.232" offset="6700283">Now, this indemnity clause was in the contract in the charter party, it wasn't in the stevedoring contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.194" offset="6732152">It was in a charter party between a shipowner chartering his ship out to Pan-Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.118" offset="6755871">In other words, it was a clause that regardless of where their ship might go or regardless whether independent contractors or others were doing it, the -- the owner was going to be reimbursed by the bareboat charter refer and protected against anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.378" offset="6824835">But that is -- that's in a charter party, a lease of the vessel if it wasn't any indemnity agreement in a stevedore contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.834" offset="6866735">And the Court here was -- I'm sure was not deciding Reed against Yaka on the very narrow principle that there was an indemnity agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.134" offset="6915950">Now, the Supreme Court, this Court said in Reed against Yaka that the economic effect was really the same when you threw the ultimate loss here on the party who is the man's employer because that was no different than the situation where an independent contracting stevedore would be the employer, would suffer the ultimate loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.553" offset="7029635">And the Court uses the words "Who could then, under Ryan, have recovered."</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.249" offset="7056384">Now, under Ryan, the Court didn't -- did not say under the indemnity clause and the charter party, it said under Ryan which I take it means, under the principles of implied warranty laid down in Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.981" offset="7107271">And I'm sure that Reed against Yaka, if the case came up again, even with no expressed indemnity in the charter party, the Court would be reaching the same result as it did in Reed against Yaka.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.504" offset="7161396">I think the Court was laying down a broad principle there, at least I so -- I so read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.110" offset="7183862">And on this particular point, I -- I don't think that the -- Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.038" offset="7223568">Their dissent was on the expressed language of the Longshoreman's Act, I don't think they disagreed or they didn't express any disagreement with this particular passage which we think really declared the result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.924" offset="7283022">Now, of course this decision came out after our Ninth Circuit decision in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.004" offset="7307368">The Ninth Circuit decided this case last winter and Reed against Yaka was decided in May.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.200" offset="7336208">Now that brings me now to the second point which is really just appointed fairness as between the parties and I've already perhaps touched on that the -- it's the stevedore who brings this equipment aboard has exclusive control and possession of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.356" offset="7432756">The stevedore contractor owns the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.064" offset="7443623">The shipowner has absolutely nothing to do with it except he may have a -- a mate who possibly is on the ship if he asked to watch the whole shipment but -- and the stevedore, but bringing defective equipment aboard puts the shipowner in a position where under its warranty to the injured men, it has to bear a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.903" offset="7534947">The steve -- the stevedore has placed this loss upon the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.926" offset="7555114">And just as a simple matter of fairness, it seems that the stevedore who has visited the loss imposed the loss on the shipowner ought to indemnify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.051" offset="7603597">I've been thinking about this and it seems to me that implied warranties -- let me speak in implied warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.632" offset="7629928">It's -- it's merely what the parties probably would have intended and would have expressed if they had thought about the matter and discussed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.088" offset="7663679">And think that if the parties -- if a shipowner and a stevedore thought about this while they sit down and they'd say something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.147" offset="7691995">The shipowner would say, “Well now Mr. Stevedore, I'm hiring you to do the stevedoring work on my ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.107" offset="7719790">You're an expert in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.838" offset="7726686">We rely upon you as an expert,” and the cases have uniformity said that this shipowner does rely on the stevedore as an expert in his field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.744" offset="7758346">“Now you're going to be bringing a lot of equipment aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.101" offset="7767751">It's your equipment, you have charge of it, you know how old it is, I don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.613" offset="7797844">You'll be using it in your operations but you know, under this law of Sieracki and Petterson why -- if any of your equipment turns out to be bad and somebody gets hurt -- why -- they're going to hold me liable even though it's your equipment, so I want you to warranty to me that any equipment you bring aboard will be reasonably fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.443" offset="7889168">I don't ask if you be an insurer or that it be the most perfect equipment in the world but I ask you to warrant that it will reasonably fit for the purpose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.335" offset="7924694">And the fairness of that would probably be apparent and the stevedore will probably say, "Well sure, that seems fair, it's my equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.642" offset="7953951">If I'm going to put you on a spot by putting you in a hole for my equipment, I ought to warrant it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.545" offset="9373550">But here, we're in a maritime field that the parties know about and the shipowner is going to be held absolutely liable regardless of negligence to the -- to the very workmen employees of this contractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2419.842" offset="9782732">Now, that case is a little fuzzy because some of these cases are little fuzzy, they speak of warranty and yet, it's little fuzzy because there maybe elements of negligence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.380" offset="9832887">But that Mowbray versus Merryweather is one of the leading cases where the shoe is on the other foot and they hold that the shipowner owes a -- a warranty to the stevedore contractor as it's here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.460" offset="9885236">Now, the result holding the stevedore liable in this case is surely not merely so harsh on the stevedore as the well set of law of Crumady against Joachim Fisser where the vessel owner furnishes -- where the ship's equipment is unfit or unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.680" offset="9958066">Now, in the Crumady case, the ship furnished or supplied for the work and unseaworthy and defective winch, didn't have a proper -- didn't have its cutoff device set properly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2696.254" offset="10888338">Now, that thought was strongly expressed in Booth and by Justice Jertberg and by another panel of the Second Circuit in the DeGioia case where they suggest that it should be the policy of the law to place the ultimate risk on the party who is in the best position to eliminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.768" offset="10966392">Now, I'm not talking here about negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.907" offset="10983006">The stevedore can probably satisfy the requirements of due care by just having some evidence that they inspected the equipment, but I'm talking about the opportunity that the stevedore contractor has to prevent accidents, to go further to eliminate accidents and perhaps go beyond the call of duty of ordinary care by keeping a record of this equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.193" offset="12188191">Our client is the Oregon Stevedoring Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.528" offset="12261439">Now, it's -- it's probably already been developed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.498" offset="12273351">There are two premises with which we start this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.782" offset="12286516">Number one, Mr. Griffith has long since had the benefit of this warranty of seaworthiness and has recovered his money and has departed the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.751" offset="12334373">Number two, that the stevedore in this case is free from any negligence and that the stevedore has in fact inducted the test and inspections required of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.821" offset="12406680">I might say that in the trial of this case, the Steamship Company was given the benefit of the res ipsa loquitor doctrine or the inference of negligence and the trial judge found that the stevedore company had overcome that presumption by evidence that the trial of the inspections of the equipment which they supplied to the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.892" offset="12502915">Finding 22, the respondent reasonable care provide the libellant with the proper tent tie-down rope and has overcome any inference of negligence which might be inferred on behalf of libel acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.204" offset="12556204">Finding 21, the tent line was a proper type of rope for use and there was no evidence that it was in an unsatisfactory condition so that we start out with the premise that there is no negligence on the part of the stevedore company and that we have in fact the -- the shipowner has failed in -- in proving any negligence or any failure to conduct the test and inspections that they indicate should be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.672" offset="12886079">It seems to us then that this case lays open to bear question of whether the stevedore hasn't insured of its equipment, reasonable fitness of its equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.889" offset="12938951">Now, as Mr. Wood has indicated, of course this is an admiralty case and the federal laws the -- is the law which is applicable to federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.364" offset="12988792">And the Ryan case was the initial case which imposed the warranty of workmanlike service on the stevedore company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.215" offset="13048247">And of course in the Ryan case, the Court came out with this definition of -- of workmanlike service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.045" offset="13107597">The Court in the Ryan case was concerned with the Halcyon case which preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.085" offset="13135705">In the Halcyon case, this Court had determined that the shipowner could not recover from a stevedore company on a tort theory because of no contribution among tortfeasors and they would not apply the admiralty rule of -- by the damages in non-collision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.187" offset="13212087">So the Court was faced with a situation of say a stevedore which was 75% negligent and a shipowner maybe 25% negligent, the shipowner can't make any recovery from the stevedore company because of the -- of the Halcyon rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.590" offset="13277706">So the Court said, "We must lay this on principles of contract," which they did and they said that there is this warranty, this implied warranty which flows out of the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.047" offset="13323577">Now, they did not say or this Court did not say that the stevedore owed a warranty of seaworthiness to the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.609" offset="13365791">The shipowner's warranty to a longshoreman or a seaman aboard the ship is a warranty of seaworthiness as if this Court has said a liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.631" offset="13417932">This Court did not say in the Ryan case that the stevedore owed a warranty of seaworthiness to the shipowner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3665.613" offset="14765850">And that is -- is a problem that faced the Court in -- in that case and that stevedore was responsible because he happens to also be a shipowner and operator and would be responsible under the warranty of seaworthiness to a longshoreman so that -- that case did not concern the issue that's facing us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.290" offset="14852577">And further as we indicated in our brief, in fact in the District Court's opinion, there was absolute expressed written hold-harmless agreement between the shipowner and the stevedore bareboat charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.725" offset="14918301">And there was no question that if liability was visited on the shipowner that it would be passed on to the stevedore bareboat charter as the expressed contract hold and harmless for everything that occurs during the course of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.756" offset="14974412">Now -- and I might say further, I -- I think the Reed case is an example of -- of this Court's concern for people who don't have the opportunity to make a contract to protect themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.586" offset="15045674">Mr. -- Mr. Reed obviously didn't know whether the bareboat charter of the ship was his employer or the man in the moon.</text>
