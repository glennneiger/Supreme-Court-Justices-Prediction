            <label>Mr. Benjamin C. Sigal</label>
            <text syncTime="23.563" offset="197674">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.005" offset="219408">This case concerns a suit to compel arbitration of a grievance pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.157" offset="264025">The Court of Appeals for the State of New York refused to compel arbitration on the ground that the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.180" offset="316061">The material facts of the case are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.077" offset="327659">As a result of an N.L.R.B. election, the petitioner was certified as the bargaining representative for a unit of production and maintenance of employees at the respondents Baltimore works.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.218" offset="380217">On -- pursuant -- after having a national agreement was executed between the party and the respondent agreed to recognize the petitioner on behalf of and in conjuncture with this Local 130 as the exclusive bargaining representative of these employees among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.374" offset="460884">The national agreement provide among other things for arbitration of grievances which involve the interpretation, application and -- or claim violation of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.320" offset="516681">On March 5th, 1958, the petitioner filed a grievance protesting the respondent's refusal to apply the agreement to the performance of certain work which has been assigned to employees who were in the engineering laboratory of the respondent outside of the unit of -- of the petitioner but in the same plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.113" offset="623783">The union can tender that the work was production and maintenance work and that the assignment of this work outside the bargaining unit was a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.116" offset="679790">And -- and the assignment that to this engineering laboratory which was in a bargaining unit represented by another union, the Federation as so-called, which represented the salary technical, clerical and professional employees but excluding the production and maintenance workers and they had an agreement for recognition on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.159" offset="792012">So, there was no conflict between the units of either of the unions, no conflicts in the agreement of recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.612" offset="829837">Now, in support of its grievance, the petitioner contended that the respondent had moved production and maintenance work to the engineering laboratory as well as employees from the petitioner's unit into this laboratory and had thereby violated the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.525" offset="909458">When the company rejected the union's grievance, the union requested arbitration and sought enforcement of its -- and when -- and the company rejected it, thereupon the union sought enforcement in the New York State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.861" offset="974764">During this entire period, from the beginning to the filing of the grievance to the very end, the Federation did not events any interest whatsoever in this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.192" offset="1024188">Nothing in the record indicates any interest on the part of the Federation.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.470" offset="1045295">Now, although filed in a state court is of course clear that there's no question that the outcome of this suit is governed by the federal law applicable to the enforcement of collective bargaining agreement pursuant to Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.471" offset="1121259">Now, the respondent's resistance to arbitration is not based on a clean limitation of the agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.512" offset="1169429">It rather contends that the matter to be arbitrated falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.698" offset="1214151">Now, at the outset, we pleaded as clear that the basis of the decision of the court below was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.623" offset="1253857">The court there relied on the Marine Engineer Beneficial Association decision which holds that in the relation between the state and the Federal Government, the state court injunction is preempted whenever the subject matter of the dispute is arguably within the area which Congress regulated in the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.521" offset="1357406">However, the line of decisions in Smith versus Evening News Association by which this is -- this case is a part, make it clear that the question of the relationship between this federally created jurisdiction of the Board and the federally created jurisdiction of the courts under Section 301 to enforce collective bargaining agreements is entirely a different question from the one which this Court dealt with in Marine Engineer Beneficial Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.980" offset="1491257">In the former line of cases that is in the Smith line of cases, the jurisdiction of the Board is not displaced by Section 301 and neither is the jurisdiction of the courts under Section 301 displaced by that of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.486" offset="1553324">I don't wish to dwell further really on this question so far because it appears to us that the respondent does not really contend that the basis of the decision of the court below was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.591" offset="1605778">But may we just -- the concluding paragraph of the respondent's brief at page 45, the respondent asserts fully whether or not strictly speaking, the result below should be expressed in terms of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.058" offset="1663561">The preemption cases provide a forceful analogy of -- supporting affirmance without reliance on any doctrine, there were doctrine enclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.947" offset="1707133">The decision below should be affirmed on the basis of the overall scheme of the Act requires that the instant dispute be resolved by the N.L.R.B. to the exclusion of an arbitrator under the IUE agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.016" offset="1763453">Now, the respondents and of course this argument, asserts that this case falls within the exception suggested in Smith that this is -- that this is a serious problem which was not dealt within the Smith and that there is no fair and orderly solution available otherwise and through the N.L.R.B.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.952" offset="1871182">And this is a serious problem which must now be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.934" offset="1887065">Now, in Smith, the Court -- this Court rejected the -- as a general matter, the contention of the concurrent jurisdiction of the N.L.R.B. under Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Act with that of course under Section 301, precludes enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement with respect to matters which give rise to the overlapping jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.955" offset="2003153">Now, the Court also stated there that if there are situations in which serious problems might arise out of concurrent jurisdiction over acts which are mount to an unfair labor practice to the courts will -- the Court will face those problems when they arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.293" offset="2076505">But the Court did not find such a problem to exist in Smith and we submit there is no such problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.246" offset="2100328">And just recently, the -- this Court of Appeals, the Second Circuit dealing with exactly the same situation as we have here, likewise found there was no such serious problem as the Court suggested in Smith and resolved the matter in favor of enforcing the arbitration agreement, that case is now pending before this Court on a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.074" offset="2207640">Now here, unlike Smith, the Court is not asked to determine the merits of the contract grievance and enter a final judgment of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.647" offset="2249958">All we have here is the question of enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate the grievance and that therefore, there are even less possibility of any serious problem than there was in Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.589" offset="2301680">The precise scope of such problem as may arise will only be known after the arbitration when the nature of the grievance will be precisely known, when the fact will be determined, when the merits of the dispute had been established and the remedy chosen by the arbitrator has been stated and given.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.888" offset="2390915">No problems arise from the mere fact of ordering arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.341" offset="2416724">Should the union lose its grievance that would dispel all the specters which have been suggested?</text>
            <text syncTime="585.523" offset="2445458">If the union wins the arbitration, it is not possible to state now that there will be any serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.237" offset="2468342">The resolution which the arbitrator might determine upon might be satisfactory to all parties and there will be no further problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.099" offset="2503764">Now, this Court had occasion to deal with a case very closely resembling the one here in the White -- Whitehouse versus Illinois Central Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.016" offset="2555486">Now, that was -- and arose under the -- Rail National -- the Railway Labor Act and also concerned a two-union work assignment dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.809" offset="2602611">One union took the case to the National Railroad Adjustment Board which refused the request of the employer that the other union be notified that it had a right to participate in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.681" offset="2654124">The employers if there would be serious problems of that union were not present or not participating in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.035" offset="2691532">This Court there held that the injuries feared by the employer were too speculative to warrant judicial relief because an award it said, “Both maybe rendered which could occasion no possible injury to it."</text>
            <text syncTime="669.945" offset="2783169">Now, while the problems arising out of the enforcements of the arbitration agreement are entirely speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.121" offset="2819845">The harms that would flow from the denial of arbitration in this case are very concrete and substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.760" offset="2850461">Contrary to the company's assertion, no relief can be obtained by the petitioner from the National Labor Relations Board for the violation of its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.713" offset="2898213">The Board has no jurisdiction to enforce collective bargaining agreements as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.835" offset="2922663">This grievance may go far beyond the matter of the question of the work assignment or -- or representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.643" offset="2953906">They are in this case serious problems of seniority involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.065" offset="2971669">Now, if in -- the respondent asserts this is a representation matter which it should go to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.390" offset="3000926">Now, we're -- it cannot be set at the outset, the Board would even take it if a petition for clarification were submitted, the Board might decide this isn't the case for clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.835" offset="3046693">Now let us assume the -- a representation petition were filed, where in this case even though there's great doubt that it would be accepted because of a contract bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.239" offset="3096325">The result -- the Board -- the Board would presume the correctness of the work assignment by the employer, that is not one of the criteria used by the Board in determining the appropriate bargaining -- bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.695" offset="3170200">The Board will decide the question solely on the principles that has established for the -- determining the proper -- the composition of bargaining units and not on the basis of the petitioner's contract right.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.426" offset="3229027">Thus, assuming the Board could petition the -- the petitioner could go to the Board, the -- such a proceeding would not be equivalent to the enforcement of the petitioner's collective bargaining agreement through arbitration and certainly could not dispose of all of the matters which had been raised by the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.584" offset="3321710">If on the other hand, this is not a representation dispute but it is a work assignment dispute as the petitioner believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.243" offset="3356296">Any authority of the Board to resolve this matter would be dependent on Section 10 (k), flowing from the violation of Section 8 (b) (4) (d) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.102" offset="3407809">The Board's authority to determine work assignment disputes under Section 10 (k), comes into play only when the -- when the union unlawfully engages in a strike or a threat of a strike and then a charge is filed against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.421" offset="3497044">Only then may the Board take up the question of the work assignment and resolve it to the extent that it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.246" offset="3540407">Now, it appears to us that certainly that Congress did not intend to make an actual or a threatened obstruction of commerce a condition precedent to the availability of a forum for the resolution of such a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.334" offset="3608743">Now, furthermore, in violating Section 8 (b) (4) (d) if the petitioner were to determine upon that, the union would subject itself to damages for violation of its -- under Section 303 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.749" offset="3670392">A grant of concurrent jurisdiction to the courts to hoard tort damages for conduct which is also an unfair labor practice, further confirms we believe that Congress did not intend that the jurisdiction of the courts established under Section -- entitled 3 of the Act, was to be ousted by the authority given to the Board under Section 10 (k), from title 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.902" offset="3771016">And this of course decides in the fact that that -- that authority couldn't be exercised to resolve a contract right of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.527" offset="3809468">Now, I've mentioned that this might be either a representation dispute or work assignment dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.824" offset="3830680">There are some difference between the parties as to what it is, but the parties are agreeing, however, that is immaterial that the result of this case whether is a -- a one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.012" offset="3887417">Now, the denial of enforcement of the arbitration agreement in this case or at any case would mean that whatever that party asserts a grievance which raises a question which arguably falls within the jurisdiction of the N.L.R.B. , it will find that it has no remedy for the enforcement of its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.793" offset="3990549">And I submit that most grievances can in one flash or another, arguably be shown to the matter within the jurisdiction of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.216" offset="4036211">Now, such a holding would certainly invite parties -- reluctant parties to arbitration agreements to raise -- to refuse arbitration and the hope that they could flash in a matter somehow into a question which falls under the jurisdiction of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.989" offset="4111339">And this, I submit would create a burden on the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements and arbitration agreements comparable to what the -- this Court found, the American Manufacturing case and this would certainly be a very highly crippling influence or factor on arbitration matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.634" offset="4201932">Now, the respondent lay stress on the fact that in this case, it maybe confronted with the obligation to arbitrate impromptu agreements, covering the same matter and therefore, it might be confronted with inconsistence of warrants with one of which should -- could not comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.569" offset="4281657">Now, the sure answer to that contention is that this is at this point highly speculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.924" offset="4307048">Furthermore, this asserted dilemma falls outside the scope of the preemption cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.096" offset="4335783">To the extent that such a problem may arise in the future, it is certainly not in our view that be resolved by weighing the congressional intent as to the balance of any could be struck by between Section 301 and Section 10 (k) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.747" offset="4406314">Respondent's remedy to bar enforcement of arbitration does not resolve the conflict but would force both unions to accept the respondent's determination of its own -- of its obligations as final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.054" offset="4467545">Now, in this case, there is no indication that the other union has any interest in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.991" offset="4507355">There is no dispute between the two unions so far as this record reflects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.839" offset="4534732">The respondent would have the court believe that there is such a dispute and that the employer is just an impartial neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.545" offset="4569527">Now, as a matter of fact, this dispute didn't arise until after both agreements were executed and arose by the unilateral act of the employer in making the changes in these transfers of employees and changes of work assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.080" offset="4635669">This is a dispute between the petitioner and the employer and it falls within an area which -- matters which are the critical issues in bargaining at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.467" offset="4693243">The real question's relating to the performance of new work, the consequences of technological change, the introduction of new processes and equipment and the effect of the -- and the impact of the relocation of plants, these are all matters which are of vital importance in bargaining today and they are vital importance in the administration of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.395" offset="4792926">These are the grist in -- of the grievance mill, frequently they involved erosions of the bargaining units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.948" offset="4831169">They are highly inflammable issues and they should be disposed off expeditiously, and the parties have agreed on a procedure for disposing of these matters of another contract violations expeditiously.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.491" offset="5221334">I call your attention to -- I think at page 13 of the respondent's brief or specifically a search that under either of those characterizations that has work assignment dispute or representation dispute or any other characterization, the fundamental nature of the grievance as such that the decision below should be affirmed, so that none of the parties here as really -- a critical rise on that place -- on a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.789" offset="5350484">Now, in our view that, if the decision of the court below is affirmed, it will unsettle countless collective bargaining relationship which seriously interfere with the expeditious settlement of disputes by the machinery contemplated by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.525" offset="5429478">And what emasculate Section 301 of the Act insofar as that Act makes -- that Section makes possible the enforcement of arbitration agreements.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1356.593" offset="5529788">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.833" offset="5570748">The Government filed a brief in this case at the Court's invitation and I sought time to participate in the oral argument because in some respects, this seems to us to be a complicated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.682" offset="5630098">Our position basically reaches the same result as the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.604" offset="5653817">We think that the courts below did have power to order the claim to arbitration, that therefore the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.897" offset="5694986">At the outset, it seems to me essential that have a clear understanding of the issue that the union sought to have referred to arbitration, not because the Court needs to decide it, indeed of course it won't decide it, but because that characterizes and affects the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.374" offset="5768861">In our view, the dispute does relate to the representation of employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.825" offset="5798640">The claim as it was setout in the original petition which is the procedure in New York for securing a mandatory -- mandate to arbitrate, sets forth at the back bottom of page 12 that the union is protesting the refusal of the company to apply the national agreement to related supplement, to its production and maintenance employees at its Baltimore plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.783" offset="5902503">Then it goes on and describes the work their engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.071" offset="5919640">The applicable contract provision according to the petition is the recognition clause over on page 13 at the top, where the company agrees to recognize the union, where the union or its locals through a lawful National Labor Relations Board certification, has been lawfully designated as the exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.018" offset="6007411">And then there's a reference later in the paragraph, two-board certifications that are made a part of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.868" offset="6042833">And the particular certification in question appears at the bottom of that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.496" offset="6065403">So that the complaint in essence is that the company violated the recognition clause by not recognizing the union as the bargaining representative of a unit described in the contract and also a unit which had been certified by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.707" offset="6150248">We think that it follows simply from this statement of claim that the company is right in saying that the dispute is over the extent of the union's bargaining rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.350" offset="6196746">It is, thus, the union represents, thus the contract cover the employees in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.757" offset="6226422">That is not, which I shall explain later, what we say is a work assignment dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.805" offset="6250559">The union has a remedy here before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.941" offset="6271143">If the company is indeed failing to bargain with it as the representative of employees within the unit described in the certification and in the contract, then that is a refusal to bargain collectively, a charge could be filed and presumably a complaint would issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.569" offset="6341674">Equally, the union and also the employer for that matter could file a motion with the Board seeking to clarify the certification and thus resolve the very point issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.486" offset="6397367">One of the little ironies perhaps irrelevant of this case is that the company is talking -- has been talking for three and a half years about the need for a National Labor Relations Board determination but they've never taken the case there which they perfectly well could've done without I believe abandoning their locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.082" offset="6479705">Thus, our position differs a little from part of Mr. Sigal, and that we say that the underlying dispute should be referred to arbitration in accordance with the contract even though there is a remedy before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.760" offset="6542399">On the law, two really settled principles or policies, it seemed to me to be the starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.020" offset="6579493">The first is that it's the policy of the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor Management Reporting Act to encourage the arbitration of disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements of where the parties have entered into a consensual agreement for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.496" offset="6653367">And the second is, as held in Smith against the Evening News Association, neither a court nor an arbitrator loses jurisdiction over a claim for breach of contract merely because the Labor Board might have jurisdiction over the same person so that here, the company that prevailed has the burden of establishing some kind of an exception to well-settled principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.873" offset="6782830">We can lay aside at once, I think, the -- the company's argument and exception should be made because the objective of the IUE grievances they say is totally repugnant to the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.502" offset="6837373">The IUE says that what maybe greater truth, that the company's conduct is totally repugnant to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.387" offset="6868929">The fact is of course that at this stage, both of those assertions assumedly answered to the underlying dispute of which is still unsettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.928" offset="6911039">There are just four things that I think can be said at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.791" offset="6938520">First, there is a dispute over the scope of the bargaining unit as to which either the petitioner or the company is wrong and none of us note that knows which.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.698" offset="6990137">Second, the dispute could be settled by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.432" offset="7013125">Third, if the dispute goes to an arbitrator, he may make the very same ruling that the Board would make if it had the case or he may reach a different conclusion not richer than the willful sense, but because his judgment of what the Board would do is different than the Board's own judgment of what it would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.552" offset="7093582">At fourth, an award in favor of the petitioner would not bind the rival union which could thereafter institute an unfair labor practice proceeding against the employer for honoring the arbitrator's award, hoping to get a contrary decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.527" offset="7169442">The real question, therefore, is whether arbitration of the question of contract interpretation involving representation under these circumstances threatens such interference with the policies of the National Labor Relations Board or of the Act or such unfairness to employees or the company as to justify an exception from the rule laid down in Smith against the Evening News Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.772" offset="7286471">Submitting the dispute over the precise scope of the bargaining unit to arbitration would carry no real threat we submit, of interference with policies of the National Labor Relations Act or with the operations of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.589" offset="7361703">The arbitrator, when he interprets the contract, will be following the language of a Board certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.567" offset="7393677">Presumably, he will guide himself as best as he can by the Board policies, the precedents and the chance that he will reach a different conclusion than the -- the Board would reach is perhaps not very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.163" offset="7451982">But even if his conclusions were different, even if we take the other heart of the dilemma, there would be no significant interference with the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.394" offset="7496913">This dispute and the thousands of disputes like it are concerned with the classification of relatively small peripheral groups of employees who could probably be classified in one unit just as well as in the other and I've often wondered why the flipping of coin wouldn't reach just as sensible result as the mountains of papers that are gone through in representation proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.756" offset="7662425">The underlying question as I understand it is, are these employees in the laboratory doing what may properly be described as production work or are they doing what they properly be described as research or experimental way?</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.553" offset="7869628">I don't think that a court should say, "Or we are satisfied that there's no doubt about the Board's -- the meaning of the contract or the meaning of the certification as a same thing and therefore, the case will go to arbitration."</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.761" offset="7922395">No, I would most empathically argue that it is not to the court to say that there is no real merit to the claim here and I think this question was in effect, decided by the enterprise case and the other steel workers case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.671" offset="10062033">The -- let me turn if I may to the claim of unfairness to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.759" offset="10090454">The argument of course is that if the arbitrator sustains the company's position that will be the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.475" offset="10125249">If he sustains the union's position in the arbitration, then the company says, “This won't bind the other union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.998" offset="10163388">There's a chance that it will run to the Board and claim that there's been an unfair labor practice and the Board may find that the award did require the commission of an unfair labor practice and we will be required to stop bargaining with IUE and possibly, we will even have to pay back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.513" offset="10241442">That possibility is inherent in the situation if IUE wins, I take it they're going to have to pay for a lot of back pay so that -- that unfortunately is hardly inescapable either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.178" offset="10288044">Now, granted that arbitration does create some risks prejudice to the company because it get carries no guarantee of absolute finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.384" offset="10328900">I wanted to suggest two general things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.151" offset="10343946">First, there are good, many considerations that tamper that risk, also they don't destroy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.704" offset="10366203">And second, that there are good many considerations on the other side that I varied to a moment ago that would make an extremely unfortunate to create this kind of exception to the role of the Smith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.553" offset="10413537">The temperate considerations are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.594" offset="10429733">In the first place, one can't forget that the company did unequivocally promise to arbitrate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.567" offset="10453661">If they've got themselves in an inconsistent position, they are a little bit like the fellow who was -- sold his house twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.239" offset="10488351">Again, it is entirely speculative whether the rival union would carry the case to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.231" offset="10516250">I can't say it wouldn't, but it isn't here, wasn't in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.303" offset="10536626">If an arbitrary award -- went against it, it might well stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.461" offset="10561181">Third, even so the arbitration award would not be legally binding upon the rival union, it would undoubtedly carry the weight of an expert's determination in the Board proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.775" offset="10618441">He would have been a man on the spot, and I do urge that is a very great advantage over cold record in Washington for four or five men dealing with words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.633" offset="10661909">Fourth, either the court below or the arbitrator himself might offer the rival union an opportunity to come in and be heard in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.276" offset="10708511">It's even conceivable if the court below might order the case to arbitration only if the rival union were given an opportunity to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.115" offset="10739858">I don't say it would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.354" offset="10744769">I have no precedents that I can cite but it's at least the possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.988" offset="10763368">Fifth, I submit most urgently that experience was a very large number of cases both in the railway labor world and in industry generally, shows that this kind of arbitration does result in a goodly proportion of the cases in the settlement of the dispute, even though both unions aren't the parties to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.993" offset="10855320">Now again, it's not an assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.690" offset="10862111">I'm just talking about tempering considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.731" offset="10878307">And finally I point out, there's nothing extraordinary at all about an arbitrators being called upon the to decide a question which if he errs may result in his requiring the company to commit an unfair labor practice or violates some other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.592" offset="10949778">Some of you will remember that immediately after the (Inaudible), there was a considerable conflict between arbitrators and the views of General Hershey by administering the Selective Service Act about seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.743" offset="11018324">The unions for a time, took the position that the returned soldier went back on the escalator that just where he got off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.034" offset="11051551">He got credit for his work service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.381" offset="11060851">But if layoffs were deepened up to reach his service, he was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.596" offset="11085720">General Hershey took the position that the soldier was entitled to stay on the payroll as long as there was anyone there for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.418" offset="11113096">But now, arbitrators have to decide this is best they could whenever they have a seniority cases settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.179" offset="11140054">But, they have to make similar decisions today where the unions demand this that somebody be discharged under a union shop clause and if the -- he has to do the best he can, there's always the risk that sat that in award will call for some violation of the surrounding legal structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.300" offset="11224586">If arbitrations to go forward, that is inevitable I think, inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.422" offset="11253112">Now, all that is that this need just it might be, it involves risks of duplication of inconsistency, but Labor Relations doesn't always flourish under the tidiest conceptual formulas and a more tentative process something that gets closer to the practice and the human problems often is the more effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.264" offset="11364394">Against any remaining unfairness or disadvantage that I don't think it can be talked entirely out of the case, I'm greatly exaggerated, when does have to balance the affirmative advantages of adhering to the settled policy of allowing courts and especially arbitrators to exercise their usual jurisdiction over claims for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.324" offset="11460629">And I -- I don't want to talk about the general policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.944" offset="11471182">That's clear enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.885" offset="11474944">But I would like to emphasize the advantages of arbitration in this specific kind of case and the disadvantages of trying to draw isn't no exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.807" offset="11518621">In the first place as I suggested a moment ago, the decision can be made in arbitration by a man personally familiar with the flatwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.412" offset="11561044">It can be made far more quickly and in expensively than in a Board proceeding, to hold that an arbitrator may not proceed whenever either party raises a question of representation, would fragment, impede and delay the arbitration of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.422" offset="11649024">Let me put a simple example to illustrate that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.627" offset="11665847">Suppose that a company in the time of layoffs, lays off A who's worked to the company 10 years and keeps B who has worked, let's say, seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.341" offset="11720704">The union says there's been a violation of the seniority clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.465" offset="11737213">The company replies that though A had a break in his seniority so, he really has only five years seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.258" offset="11780368">In addition, A can't do the work anyway and B can and finally throws in for good measure without putting any real stock in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.040" offset="11815581">Anyway, A is a supervisor and he's not within the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.847" offset="11834807">Now, this would mean under the respondent's view, the whole arbitration has got to seize, that everybody has got to wait until the matter goes to the Board to find out whether A is or isn't outside the bargaining unit, whereas, if it could go to arbitration, the whole thing will be decided then and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.801" offset="11930624">In other words, that up -- opens opportunities for delay at best for stalling at words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.498" offset="11965315">Again, I think the respondents will -- would introduce horribly confusing distinctions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.897" offset="13922931">Now, the other difference is that in the Smith case and in most to the cases that one thinks about in connection with the Smith problem, the Board would treat the arbitration award as binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.874" offset="13986879">Here, I am confident that it would give it weight if the Federation were given a chance to come in and didn't, I'm confident that it would regarded practically as controlling and that might happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.488" offset="14141315">And the other point that I would suggest that this has in common with the Smith problem that I would have devoted time to -- if I have to spend so much time on question is that this case, well I think in all fairness, it has to do with a question of representation, is as a practical matter, indistinguishable from the work assignment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.262" offset="14256462">And if there is anything that is clear about this case, it is that the company is altogether wrong in saying that work assignment problems can be settled between two unions under Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.846" offset="14302751">Indeed, it's that more than anything else that led me to be here because that would upset more other important enter union arrangements, and Board distinction worked out that -- argues than -- than almost any other case of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.606" offset="14845785">The Federation unit excludes specifically all production and maintenance works, so we did not consciously sell our house to two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.962" offset="14887267">We quite meticulously kept these jurisdictional problems straight by insisting on Board certifications as a matter of company policy and by limiting recognition obligations to Board certifications and to the Board determine units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.489" offset="14949334">Now, the electrical industry is quite unlike in most other major industries organized by the CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.640" offset="14977964">The steel industry is entirely organized by the steel workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.451" offset="14993220">Electrical industry, there is a very terrible fragmentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.861" offset="15014849">There is the IUE, there is the old UE, there is the IBEW, there is an IAM and etcetera and -- and -- ad hoc unions such as the Federation which is quite a substantial union, but not affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.962" offset="15075244">The second factual point which I would like to make by way of propose is that this -- whether this is truly the kind of minor fringe group which the Board should not have to be bothered that one of employee does he belong here or there, is not certain in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.217" offset="15148283">But the union itself alleged in its affidavit below in a sort of backhanded way that what we've done is take half of the production and maintenance unit and put it into this laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.150" offset="15200005">Now, that unit is about 500 people so there are 250 people here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.388" offset="15220903">And -- and I don't think that is in the category of the minors fringe group that the Board shouldn't have to bother with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.338" offset="15252773">I would like to begin my submission in a sense by saying what we don't disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.015" offset="15303450">The court below unquestionably had jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of the controversy because the subject matter is an alleged breach of an agreement to arbitrate and that subject matter was clear -- clearly within the jurisdiction of the court below using the word jurisdiction in its technical census applied to courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.472" offset="15393311">We also agree that the fact that a cut controversy is cognizable by the Board under the Act and by the courts under 301 does not preclude that -- that does not militate against the courts having jurisdiction in the sense of the word which we first used it over the same controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.362" offset="15468857">That is if you -- if you bargain to comply with your statutory duty and thereby, give rise in the union both to a statutory and a contract right, that contract right at least subject to the special circumstances, which I think exist in this case, can be enforce under -- under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.158" offset="15552031">Now, Justice White referred to the similarity between this case and Smith-The Evening News.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.216" offset="15584214">The concurrency of jurisdiction as between the Board and the courts represented by Smith-The Evening News is a currency as to a claim that an employer has discriminated against an employee because of his union affiliations or associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.818" offset="15650670">It's an unfair labor practice complaint under 883 which is also brought under a contract and contracts typically agree not to discriminate by reason of union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.675" offset="15698108">Now, the decision of the court in Smith, might -- might employ a different expertise on the decision of the Board if the action were brought on unfair labor practice complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.087" offset="15743770">The -- the conclusion of the court might not find the Board and vice versa in this situation of concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.336" offset="15776684">But if the court awarded back pay to Smith, the Board would certainly offset it against any back pay award it might enter under Section 8 of the Act and vice versa again as -- if the Board acts first in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.053" offset="15827571">An employer can be exonerated by the Board under the statutory criteria and found liable by the court under the contract criteria or vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.192" offset="15864142">Now, this may create anomaly but it is not a disruptive factor in industrial relation nor does that it put the employer in impossible position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.372" offset="15900818">All that's involved is money and the inconvenience of being forced to litigate the same underlying subject matter twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.407" offset="15933001">But it was noted in Smith that at serious problems arose of -- the propriety of the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction under 301 should not be considered foreclosed by the judgment in Smith and that's what's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.101" offset="15995800">It was -- did the fourth court below properly decline to exercise its jurisdiction under 301?</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.705" offset="16030177">So far as remarks were made about the opinion of the court below and the reference to Interlake Iron, the opinion of the Court of Appeals below was a per curiam opinion Interlake had just been decided at -- in the inter-row between the argument and the writing of the opinion and they picked up the language from Interlake.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.325" offset="16104678">The opinion below which expresses the rationale we asserted is the appellate division's opinion which is not relying on dogmatic preemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.407" offset="16132995">It's relying on the orderly procedures contemplated by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.758" offset="16154415">Now, the difference between this case and the -- the unfair labor practice case in the sense of a complaint of antiunion discrimination is -- is very considerable in the -- in the -- the Smith type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.539" offset="16217527">You're dealing with allegations of employer misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.464" offset="16233200">You're dealing with the propriety of past conduct who was right and who was wrong in respect of this period in which a fellow of Smith wasn't paid and other people were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.217" offset="16276250">Once you resolved who was right and who was wrong as to that past conduct, it doesn't make any difference whether the Court resolved it or the Board resolved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.779" offset="16318464">The controversy has been put to -- to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.810" offset="16330585">Now, when the concurrency is between a question of the scope of a Board determine unit and the breach of a recognition obligation on a collective bargaining agreement which incorporates by reference that Board determine unit, when the frost of the grievance is to seek an enlargement of representational jurisdiction, the situation has entirely different because the adjudication is not going to be an adjudication of who was right and who was wrong in the past in any real sense, it's an adjudication of status who is entitled to represent these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.011" offset="16467466">And the adjudication of status has continuing effect in the industrial relations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.200" offset="16492126">It affects all rights and obligations in respect of IUE, all rights and obligations in respect to Federation, all rights and obligations in respect to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.832" offset="16530683">The employees' rights and obligations in respect of ourselves, in respect to the union involved.It even affects third-party unions not yet heard from.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.095" offset="16571747">If the arbitrator improperly includes this group in the IUE unit under Section 9 stand and we fail to deal with Federation in respect to this group and deal with the IUE respectively, we think that fringe group is up for grabs by any other union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.212" offset="16668191">That might is -- is not protected, we are not protected by 8(d) (4) (d) under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.483" offset="16697344">So when status adjudications are involved, we think that serious problems do involve -- do arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.746" offset="16722317">Now, the fact that are problems, it doesn't mean that that we carry the vague here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.536" offset="16745514">It does mean that the -- the problems required that the purposes, policies and structure of the entire scheme of the Act be taken into account in construing and applying Section 301 here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.067" offset="16811656">Now, Section 301 is not an independent categorical imperative in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.193" offset="16832136">It embodies a policy favoring arbitration, but it is not the only policy in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.819" offset="16854601">There are many coordinate policies in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.395" offset="16864946">And I take it -- Mr. Cox agrees those policies maybe relevantly discuss here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.899" offset="16886993">We disagree as to the weight to be given to -- to the balancing of advantage and disadvantage in this case, but they are properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.084" offset="16923669">And one of the main charges put against us is that we are dealing with speculative possibilities and speculative problems, and speculative injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.886" offset="16962957">In other words speculative is used as an epithet there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.361" offset="16972779">We cannot guarantee that anyone of the many, many undesirable consequences that couldn't secure actually will ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.455" offset="17001200">The question isn't whether any or all of them or each of them is inevitable if this goes to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.834" offset="17026696">The question is what is reasonably foreseeable as a practical matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.698" offset="17042160">Are we to be put out our peril because the harm we talk about, respective harm we talk about is not inevitable?</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.998" offset="17071313">We should not be put at our peril for having done everything the Act seems to have required of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.783" offset="17094510">We bargain with unions that represent our employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.392" offset="17108929">We recognize them and agree to recognize them for the units for which the Board determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="4699.292" offset="18900511">Now, that -- that's sort of a basic conclusion of a lot of good arbitrators, and that's really in a many respects of the heart of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4738.722" offset="19058291">Now, they must have mean policy emanations other than arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="4762.453" offset="19153168">Here, we have a case unlike Steel Workers which brings you back to what was said in Lincoln Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.239" offset="19172289">You have to go and look at the policies of Section 7, Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.252" offset="19188381">And -- and those policies certainly who represents serious questions as to exercise of 301 jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.620" offset="19221817">And that question on 301 should be in the spirit of Lincoln Mills and attempt to evolve a coherent and rational scheme for the rest -- enforcement of the -- of rights in the resolution of disputes looking to the overall purpose of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.174" offset="19296110">We think that -- that the question is, would -- that Congress express -- expressly or impliedly, a view that this -- that that 301 should be used to force arbitration here or if you could read Congress' tentative mind on this, would Congress have said, no this ought to go to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.100" offset="19363819">That's not a very orderly way to handle it and have an arbitration and then assuming IUE gets what it wants in arbitration to have all this other litigation and all this peril which we're here defending against, simply to vindicate what is called a contract right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.565" offset="19433618">Now, we think that the -- the -- looking at the other policies of the Act that they very strongly impinge on -- on the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.383" offset="19472906">In Garment Workers versus the Board, the decision of this Court held that an employer in a union may not hoist representation upon employees through a collective bargaining agreement that the remedy given by the Board there was that the contract was to be set aside and recognition was to be withheld until such time as the union would certify in a Board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.052" offset="19555558">So far as the Board policy of the -- the statutory policies under Section 7 are concerned, this characterization dispute we have is between work assignment and representational grievance doesn't seem critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.837" offset="19610728">Whether IUE's aim in arbitration is to add Federation represented employees by taking a piece of the unit or to take the work which requires the layoffs from the Federation seniority list and get those same people back onto its -- its -- doing a work under the jurisdiction of its unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.138" offset="19695888">The fact is that Federation will have fewer working members if IUE wins and IUE will have more working members if -- if IUE wins -- if -- if it wins its arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.648" offset="19737997">Now, one objection to the applicability of Section 7 policies guaranteeing employees' rights and they are the -- another group of third parties not represented here is that the arbitrator might fortuitously arrive at the same result as the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.634" offset="19809886">That is to say that the Board could agree with the union and could also agree that there are not sufficient number of people involved so that it would be inappropriate merely to clarify this fringing without another election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.275" offset="19856488">But the Board isn't going to clarify this group in without another election, without being guided by the statutory criteria on -- of Section 9 which is a command to the Board to do as much as possible in shaping these units and enacting under Section 9 to implement the rights assured by Section 7, the employee right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.363" offset="19944782">If the arbitrator felt very strongly that employee rights were being infringed here and that they're ought to be at self-determination election or something about the sort here, he has no power to order an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.593" offset="19985742">The contract arbitrator can only say as a matter of contract interpretation, you intended this or that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.404" offset="20008939">Now, if he agrees with IUE, he's going to enter an award which will obligate us to recognize IUE in respect to this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.446" offset="20049168">But he can't -- if he enters any award at all, unless he concludes that it's not arbitrable, all he can do is interpret the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.137" offset="20091904">The Court's decision in Garment Workers against the Board demonstrates that even good faith recognition is unlawful, if the union in fact does represent a majority of employees and in a -- in a -- in an appropriate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.076" offset="20143626">So the reality is that absence of certification, an employer acts at his peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.962" offset="20163271">The respondent has historically always required certifications, not only because of solicitude for employee rights but to avoid this peril which we have a perfect right to do in which the Act accorded us the right to do and the procedures to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.610" offset="20221785">Now, we have an important interest because as I say, I -- I believe there are literally 64 different unions that deal with respondent here and -- and many, many of the -- of -- of the -- of the plans that respondent have five, six, 10 unions in the same plant and we've got to be very careful in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.641" offset="20297958">Now, I'm not telling you my problems that I should be telling to an arbitrator but I'm trying to point out that we very carefully limited our dealings with unions to certified units and we very carefully limited our contracts to certified units in haec verba.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.374" offset="20368906">If we are to be put to the perils which I think genuinely exist in this case, regardless of the fact that by slim chance they could all be avoided in the various mostly assumed circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.773" offset="20418435">What is the source of this peril to us?</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.201" offset="20428152">You don't find the source of the peril in any other section of the Act, you can't find it in the agreement and I say you can't find it in 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.147" offset="20459917">I don't think 301 created the enforceability of arbitration as the highest value in our labor society.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.151" offset="20495966">Enforcement of contract rights has always been a high social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.493" offset="20517386">In -- in some cases, it has constitutional dignity in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.091" offset="20531702">The courts don't rottenly enforce contracts that because of the value embodied in -- in the ancient phrase "pacta sunt servanda.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.867" offset="20566810">They look to other social values, particularly those expressed in -- in legislation and -- and very frequently, courts refuse to enforce contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.429" offset="20601083">Now, we have here a situation where the Act has many, many coordinate values and the reference is, what would Congress have intended?</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.067" offset="20635669">And when we think there's just too much violence to all the other values of the Act to give very much weight to this (Inaudible) of contract right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.694" offset="20674121">IUE says, "We have a contract right and we can't vindicate that contract right before the Board," I -- I think it should be conceded that they can get relief in a -- in a nine -- nine proceeding before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.921" offset="20719052">But -- but they say, "That's only going to be statutory vindication and we want contract vindication."</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.016" offset="20743398">There isn't -- there isn't an important contract right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.444" offset="20757191">The contract was to be bound by the Board's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.059" offset="20775581">The contract was to be bound by the Board orders so the contract right exist that can be articulated as a contract right but it is an important contract right when you measure it against the Section 7 rights, our rights to be free of harassment in inter-union jurisdictional disputes and all the other consequences that inhere in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.610" offset="20853844">Now, we are taken to test because we haven't articulated a proper doctrine to -- to be -- to be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.666" offset="20902013">We -- we haven't relied on the preemption cases and the terms of the Garmon case in the state federal preemption cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.271" offset="20932420">Now, we -- we have -- we appreciate that we can't ask the Court to rule that on these narrow facts and know more without opinion, this case was correctly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.760" offset="20978395">There must be some rule of construction -- of 301 that -- that we are espousing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.750" offset="21014340">The -- it has been charged that any rule of -- of 301, any facet of 301 that we want enunciated here is going to give rise to bad faith litigation by employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.525" offset="21065435">I don't think that's a reason for saying 301 permits of no exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.091" offset="21087692">I don't think the fact that some employer may buy intricate inference upon a representation aspect of the grievance and then tried to bought 301 enforcement act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.465" offset="21141191">This is not that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.643" offset="21145893">This is a case which does involve issues of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.389" offset="21160939">Now, it's the function of the courts to see whether this is truly involved in grievances which are defended against on -- for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.500" offset="21197406">The appellate division below articulated the best we can do on -- on what we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.027" offset="21223528">The appellant division said, "Where the question of representation is direct and the question of contract breach peripheral, arbitration should be withheld indifference to Board procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.607" offset="21277759">Whereas, if the question of representation is peripheral and the question of contract breach direct, arbitration should be preceded with notwithstanding the possible existence of Board jurisdiction over -- or an aspect of the controversy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.629" offset="21333870">Now, that isn't -- those are words direct and peripheral and they require judging, they require the lower courts to say does this directly revolve representation of an importantly involved representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.053" offset="21379636">But we just can't come up with a rule that doesn't involve some degree of judging.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.589" offset="21397713">Now, the exception to arbitrability or the enforcement of the arbitrability clauses which IUE talks about is barbed right out of the contract hornbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.552" offset="21437628">The contract hornbooks say, "The contract is enforceable if the court has jurisdictional of the parties and if it is not an illegal contract."</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.331" offset="21472737">Now, I think 301 meant something more than -- than (Inaudible) on contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.390" offset="21496978">I mean, this is not the ordinary commercial contract which should be enforced if legal and if the Court has jurisdiction overlay of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.426" offset="21533027">301 contemplated a little more particularization in the old hornbook of contract enforcements and -- and the challenging thing in this case is how you mesh the policies in favor of collective bargaining arbitration, although the very real violence to those policies that seems to inhere in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.571" offset="21625605">If it has to be done on a case-by-case basis that so be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.942" offset="21639189">But there is not a clearer case than the present case of a direct representational issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.725" offset="21666252">There is not a clearer case in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.942" offset="21675133">I don't know where to draw the line beyond the present case but this case has two certified unit, mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.560" offset="21709615">This Federation -- the engineering lab employ people as a class voted in the Federation election and they did not vote in the production and maintenance collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.037" offset="21747545">And -- and we have -- we have -- are sitting in that status quo and we say if the IUE wants to change, it ought to go before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.424" offset="21781086">And -- and I -- I am -- I hope I was -- I -- I assume I guess, I was not responsive Justice Stewart -- Justice White but is it a sufficient answer to say that if we lose this case, we can go to the Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.671" offset="21838033">That does that give the union a right to win it?</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.451" offset="21857155">I mean, the fact that we can go to the Board and -- and alleviate some of these consequences that adhere in what -- in the construction of 301 for which IUE speaks in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.679" offset="21906056">I -- I don't think that -- that's -- that justification for construing 301.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Hunt, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5459.229" offset="21940328">Well, you know Your Honor, our defense below at special term was two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.761" offset="21958405">We said we have not consented to arbitration but even if you construe the agreement as embodying that consent, we say that the Board process is ought to be differed to under these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.242" offset="22004381">Now, the reason we said we did not consent was not because we were going against the -- the holding Steel Workers at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.859" offset="22046804">We said that we -- the agreement should not be -- should be viewed as not having embodied our consent to this because of -- of what shows on the face of the recognition clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.775" offset="22086510">It is not an irrational inference from the recognition clause which says, "For those units of employees where they can lawfully elect, in a lawful Board proceeding" I mean is it -- it's not irrational to say that we didn't intend to arbitrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.229" offset="22152338">Now, the courts below did not decide this as a matter of whether or not the contract viewed as a whole should be construed as withholding our consent to the arbitration of this grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.325" offset="22196642">They went directly to our second defense which was that conceding arguendo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.382" offset="22220884">We've consented to this arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.463" offset="22233213">It -- it just isn't the right thing to do under 301, under all these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.980" offset="22259336">So I -- I don't know that -- that the differences -- well, I have some ad hoc differences with certain things with Mr. Cox had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.814" offset="22314611">I think it -- it has become apparent that the principal difference between our position and the -- one -- one of the principal differences between our position and out of the United States and the Board, views which are reflected here is the weighing of these policy values and these disadvantages permits exercise of concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.923" offset="22387022">And that weighing is up -- of course to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.401" offset="22404995">Most of the courts below that have weighed this and I appreciate that the Second Circuit in the General Electric case was to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.282" offset="22432475">Most of the courts below have felt that the balance tipped against arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.925" offset="22451075">Those cases are cited in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.452" offset="22465181">There are a few particularly -- the -- not -- we have -- have a reply brief filed here and -- which I would not -- not to offer any written reply too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.082" offset="22519724">But in some of the things set here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.487" offset="22529337">These railroad adjustment cases aren't really applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.188" offset="22544175">The fact that you can be forced into the Adjustment Board with one union -- without the other union being present, you've got the same Adjustment Board adjusting these things so I don't' think those cases are comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.629" offset="22601853">Mr. Sigal said, "The Board may deny him relief, may refuse to entertain a motion to clarify under Section 9," and then therefore, he's got to have this arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.485" offset="22637275">But Your Honors, if the Board refuses his motion to clarify, it's because there are too many people newly in this group to just clarify them in without any expression of their own wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.535" offset="22681475">So if he's refused a -- a relief on a motion to clarify is because in the Board's view, the policies of the Act would be squarely offended by it by -- by the relief he seeks here from the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="5658.578" offset="22737690">It's been noted that everybody who -- who's briefed this case agrees that it doesn't make any difference whether you call other work assignment grievance or a representational grievance but they agree for different reasons and -- and I -- I would not let to -- like the Court to think that that is completely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.803" offset="22806549">We say it makes no difference not because there aren't some work assignment disputes that that -- where there has been an agreement to arbitrate them, albeit between the employer and the union should not be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.876" offset="22858898">We say it isn't a question whether you call it work assignment or representation, you've got to look at the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5694.364" offset="22880841">Now, you've got to look at the grievance under Steel Workers Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.977" offset="22891290">You can't (Inaudible) look at the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.360" offset="22896828">You at least have to look at the grievance to see if it's comprehended by the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.981" offset="22915323">And while you're looking -- the courts are looking at the grievance, as this their function under Steel Workers, if they see all the elements we cite here, there's no extra burden to judging under 301 to say, "Union, you better go to the Board with this," this -- or our Congress did not intend that -- that bilateral collective bargaining agreement arbitration be the institution in our scheme to resolve this type of dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.694" offset="23030157">It's just not a very felicitous institution to be used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.056" offset="23047607">It seems, and I infer this from the plain meaning of the Act that Congress intended the Board be the institution to resolve this type of dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.432" offset="23085119">And I know that we have entered into a contract agreeing to recognize the union in respect to Board determined units and I know that we've entered into a contract agreeing to arbitrate claim violations of the agreement, but notwithstanding our agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.920" offset="23143006">I say that if you read 9 (c), reading entirety of 9 and the whole scheme it creates, this question of unit scope was intended by the Board -- by Congress to be adjudicated by the Board because and this is an -- the most important aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5778.658" offset="23218030">It is only the Board that can bind us, the IUE, the Federation and all of employees affected and exclude all of the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.171" offset="23268080">It's only the Board that has power to bind the whole country as it were and to vindicate the purposes and policies of other sections of the Act in this 9 (c) proceeding.</text>
