            <text syncTime="9.250" offset="140413">Mr. Hughes you may continue your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Hughes</label>
            <text syncTime="12.862" offset="154833">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.023" offset="167476">At the close of yesterday's session, Mr. Justice Black, you asked me to distinguish between the applicability of Sections 4 and 7, and I think that that really goes to the heart of the merits of the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.680" offset="238111">Certainly, Section 7 is broader than Section 4, but I do not think that as Judge Hayes in the Circuit Court felt that Section 7 covers all other cases in labor disputes where something called an injunction by whatever name its known is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.947" offset="347199">Because if that were so, then the Lincoln Mills decision of this Court was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.866" offset="382830">It was prohibited by Section 7 and this Court considered that and -- and rejected it and found that there was an area where there could be an injunction in the labor dispute that is not proscribed or regulated by Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.580" offset="469661">I think another case is -- is the Drake Bakeries case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.481" offset="489305">Now, there was no discussion in this Court of Norris-LaGuardia's application.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.399" offset="512920">But there too, we had a labor dispute, we had a stay of a court damage action.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.550" offset="557537">And if Section 7 applies to all kinds of stays or injunctions, it would've prevented the Court from issuing the stay of the damage action in Drake Bakeries.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.577" offset="617723">The Syres case in this Court where it involved certainly a labor dispute but it involved elements of racial discrimination an injunctive order was allowed in that case again without regard to the applicability of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.397" offset="696926">The Allen Bradley case where it involved labor unions plus some incidence of the antitrust law was another circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.969" offset="743215">The Virginia Railway System Federations case is another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.049" offset="767561">So we say that there is an area where injunctive orders, stays and so on can be issued without the scope of the Norris-LaGuardia Act either Section 4 or Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.927" offset="839032">So, we say that the decision in this case on the merits and the -- in our favor here in the Circuit Court reversed on this point without an overruling of -- of the Sinclair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.697" offset="906115">We -- we say Sinclair should be limited to its precise facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.825" offset="926699">It should be limited to a true Section 4 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.082" offset="943731">It should not be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.610" offset="949791">The Section 7 application, shouldn't be extended as Judge Hayes extended it to cover all other kinds of injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.272" offset="980511">We think that there are injunctions in proper cases where the Norris-LaGuardia Act has no application because it doesn't come within the kind of things that the Norris-LaGuardia Act was designed to meet and -- and to cope with.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.262" offset="1056371">Now, I'd -- I'd like to turn to this -- this question of mootness and say a few words with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.633" offset="1101928">The claim of mootness that we have here was created by the union right at the eve of argument, it came after our brief was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.683" offset="1166085">The member of the Union had filed the charge against the foreman, wrote a letter or signed an affidavit for his Union and said, "I withdraw the charge."</text>
            <text syncTime="278.871" offset="1218853">But the promise there doesn't run to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.688" offset="1238079">We have no way of enforcing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.766" offset="1246438">We're not parties to the Union proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.023" offset="1259499">If they violate that promise, we would have no redress to enforce it except by going back to the Federal District Court where we would have, you know, precisely the same issue that we had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.649" offset="1313938">And the Union did not accept the propositions on the merits that we urge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.432" offset="1357093">They didn't say that they're not going to discipline the foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.647" offset="1369945">They did not say as we would like them to do and to say that we will not proceed with disciplinary proceedings against the foreman until the issue of the right or wrong of it is decided by an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.195" offset="1436191">That issue was still alive and we're still very much in dispute over the -- the real issue with this case, the applicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.688" offset="1474121">So, we -- we don't have the classic mootness situation where there are in any adverse parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.059" offset="1503587">We have very adverse parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.093" offset="1511737">We -- we have a very strong difference of opinion on the real issue in the case the applicability of Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.499" offset="1545383">And, we think that this doctrine of mootness is one that should be applied in the discretion of the Court and should be set aside and not applied wherein all of the circumstances, it's not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.562" offset="1621661">And we think that -- that this is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.456" offset="1633155">We think this case is very much like the Yellow Transit case that was before the Court at the same time as the Sinclair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.138" offset="1679966">And there, the injunction that had been granted by the Circuit Court or affirmed by the Circuit Court by its own terms would've expired with the running out of the collective bargaining agreement which contained the no-strike provision which was being enforced by the -- the order there.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.623" offset="1773902">And the collective bargaining agreement did run out and the injunction did by that passage of time expire before the case was before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.891" offset="1822908">And instead of remanding the case and -- vacating the judgment of the Circuit Court on the mootness ground, this Court on the merits reversed the decision and -- and we say that that should be done here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Sugerman</label>
            <text syncTime="501.426" offset="2109106">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.358" offset="2136795">If I may, I should like to address myself at once to the answer just given by Mr. Hughes to Justice Harlan's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.400" offset="2188936">The mootness as we contend occurred on February 4th, 1964 after certiorari had been granted and after the petitioner's brief had been filed immediately before our own brief had been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.046" offset="2275558">And it occurred by reason of a letter written by I should say, signed by because the wording of it was prepared by myself in my office in the presence of the president of the Local Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.964" offset="2363225">I had called both Mr. Kelly and the president into my office after I've been informed that Mr. Kelly had no further interest in prosecuting the charge against his fellow member, Mr. Rowan and some 15 months having gone by since the incident which gave rise to the dispute between those two gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.351" offset="2480776">And their friendship having been restored, he just had no further interest in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.819" offset="2502614">We thought we should call this to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.469" offset="2517243">In it, it said that he not only withdrew the charge but moreover and this appears at page -- page 7 of the suggestion of mootness that he request the Union to cease any further processing of his charge and to terminate all proceedings against member Rowan in connection therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.761" offset="2606373">Moreover, I shall not make any grievance against member Rowan under the collective bargaining agreement with the Publishers in connection with those incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.402" offset="2649004">And then appended to that was an affidavit again which I prepared for the president of the Local Union reciting the withdrawal of the charge, the fact that he was dissolving the investigating committee which had been created.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.407" offset="2717027">He was terminating all internal union proceedings in connection therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.375" offset="2736880">And in his concluding paragraph, the president of the Union says that Mr. Kelly having assured the Union that he will initiate no further proceedings against member Rowan in connection with or growing out of the incident that he will make no grievance thereon under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.919" offset="2819009">The Union will entertain and take no further proceedings of any kind, whatever against member Rowan, all the Publisher in behalf of member Kelly and in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.648" offset="2861955">I don't know a more explicit way of saying that this matter in dispute as between Kelly and Rowan, and out of which grew the dispute between the Publisher and the Local Union was finally at an end and irrecoverably at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.305" offset="2956622">It could not be reinstituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.374" offset="2964877">The Union so stated it would not process the matter and copies of these were immediate of this letter and that the affidavit were immediately delivered to the Publisher's attorney suggesting to them that the matter has become moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.229" offset="3092250">The president of the Union has said that he would not -- that the Union would not entertain or take any proceedings upon any further charge growing out of the incidents of August 12, 1962 which had given rise to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.401" offset="3161004">Of course it had not pledged itself, never again to process a charge against a foreman member of the Union brought either by Kelly or by anyone else growing out of new incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.108" offset="3215757">So that the ultimate question the Publisher would like to have decided once and for all is still an open question but one could be decided as we now acknowledge by an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.313" offset="3276675">And why this Court should be bothered with this question is beyond me frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.751" offset="3302379">That matter has been arbitrable for the past 16 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.573" offset="3329651">Judge Murphy had ordered the case to arbitration on November 20th, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.895" offset="3354937">The Union took an appeal from that portion of Judge Murphy's order as well as from the order enjoining the internal union proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.706" offset="3402167">But we had no stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.784" offset="3414497">The arbitration was not pushed by the publisher as it was privileged to advance it.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.500" offset="3449396">And on May 20th, 1963, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that portion of Judge Murphy's order which compelled arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.502" offset="3489416">We took no appeal from that and we have been awaiting the day the publisher would carry the matter to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.219" offset="3520240">Now, the only substantive question as to whether or not, the mere filing and entertaining of a charge against the member is a violation of that provision in our collective bargaining agreement that we shall not discipline a foreman member for carrying out the management's instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.090" offset="3623685">The substantive question is one which shall be determined by an arbitrator when and if we ever get to that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.124" offset="3655868">But this, it seems to me and I have suggested this in our papers right along is not what the Publisher desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.471" offset="3701217">It doesn't want the substantive question decided it or else it could've had it decided a year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.419" offset="3725040">It wants an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.948" offset="3735176">That is the end in itself as it appears to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.069" offset="3751685">And notwithstanding and I have difficulty following the contentions of the Publisher from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.288" offset="3788570">It says in its -- in its brief and in its petition for certiorari acknowledges that the action that instituted under Section 301 sought the main relief of an order compelling arbitration to which the so-called stay or injunction was merely incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.022" offset="3891493">Now, it comes to this Court after the mootness question arose and says, "Well, that isn't what we want ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.155" offset="3932035">We want to know by a declaration of rights by this Court that we may get an injunction in this type of case."</text>
            <text syncTime="963.718" offset="3958262">And as Justice Goldberg put it in his question yesterday to Mr. Hughes, it seems that what the publisher wants here is an advisory opinion for the Government of the future affairs between this Local Union and the Publisher in respect to possible disciplining of a foreman and whether or not, the mere filing of the charge constitutes such discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.039" offset="4079574">Now, we are confident that before an arbitrator, if we ever get there, that will be held that the mere filing of the charge and ministerial investigation of the charge so as to sift the facts and determine whether or not it is what the Union's constitution calls cognizable that is on its face whether the charge is worthy of trial and then ultimately whether it should go to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.820" offset="4202663">That that question of whether the processing of the charge in that state is an act of discipline in violation of Section 20 (c) of the contract is something which, as I say, we're confident an arbitrator will decide in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.921" offset="4307048">But -- and I say this notwithstanding what I have referred to I believe as a gratuity on the part of Judge Murphy which you'll find in his opinion in the record on page 4, in the last two sentences of the second whole paragraph on that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.804" offset="4406627">Judge Murphy said, this is an extremely broad arbitration clause and certainly broad enough to include the present dispute plus the fact that Section 20 (c) prohibits the disciplining of plaintiff's foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.246" offset="4464306">Certainly he said, "This must include the filing of charges against him."</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.693" offset="4486144">Well, that's the ultimate question of course for an arbitrator and Judge Murphy should not have made the law of the case so to speak that would govern the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.877" offset="4526895">But, Judge Murphy notwithstanding and with all respect stated otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.350" offset="4552808">We are confident that the proceeding in its nature within the Union is such that the mere filing of a charge, the mere investigation of the charge is not an act of discipline contemplated by the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.222" offset="4644237">And an act of discipline in any case or possibly an act of discipline which this Court or any federal court are to concern itself with in -- in merely aiding the arbitration process for the Court intrudes itself into the merits of the arbitration dispute when it so much as enjoins for the time being pending arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.552" offset="4757608">The very Act which is alleged to be a violation of contract and contrary wise as alleged not to be a violation of contract does not frustrate the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.942" offset="4827094">It is not something which is at the heart of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.105" offset="4847783">It is -- I should like to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.670" offset="4878085">The dispute on the substantive merits in our view is a premature dispute which as we contended on successfully was not even right for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.594" offset="4945795">And perhaps, it is best left to an arbitrator to decide that it is not right for arbitration rather than for a Court to bother to say so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2219.744" offset="8982340">But, the Publisher on learning that a charge had been filed within the Union by Kelly against fellow member Rowan who was the Publishers' foreman protested that the charge should not be entertained at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.765" offset="9330395">Well, they have a right to contend before an arbitrator that I suppose if Mr. Kelly had as Mr. Hughes mistakenly said, if Mr. Kelly had said to Mr. Rowan, "I will file a charge against you."</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.248" offset="9400404">I suppose they could say that was -- that would discipline the foreman in itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.124" offset="9587858">For that puts the Court right back in the business of doing that which Norris-LaGuardia and the strengths of the Court in general have decided in our system the courts would not get into.</text>
