            <label>Mr. Donald K. Barnes</label>
            <text syncTime="30.485" offset="225364">Yes, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.427" offset="229125">Each of those cases involved that type of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.680" offset="242082">Field Enterprises of course was the same tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.422" offset="253053">Now, the -- these zone offices, as distinguished from the one-man branch office I've mentioned before, do perform some intrastate functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.563" offset="293595">They do receive and accept some orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.351" offset="308746">And we -- we cannot claim that they are not in intrastate commerce as well as the interstate with which we are here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.251" offset="340407">That being the case, under the Norton rule, the whole thing becomes taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.075" offset="355662">I say we did that before this -- this Court decided Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.739" offset="370291">But since Norton, there isn't any doubt we'll continue to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.026" offset="383457">And I want to mention due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.498" offset="393383">Now, if, as the statute says, the taxes on the business of making sales, the transactions are outside the jurisdiction for the reason that every element of the sale takes place outside the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.635" offset="453883">And although, the unconstitutionality of this type of exaction is now customarily attributed to the Due Process Clause, I point out that the same result was achieved on numerous occasions before the due -- the Fourteenth Amendment was ever enacted or ever adapted, on the basic principle that state power is confined to its own territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.357" offset="544789">And the best exposition of that principle was by Mr. Justice John Marshall Harlan in New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway against the Pennsylvania as far back as 1889, it doesn't come up since because the Due Process Clause was intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.123" offset="611871">But if, on the other hand, as the Washington court says, this tax is on local activities, that is the district managers running around within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.813" offset="654608">Its measure is grossly disproportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.091" offset="667773">It is simply incredible that a tax of several hundred thousand dollars could be incurred by the activities of a few employees and then tax much more than their aggregate salaries and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.465" offset="709256">And the tax would be the same if there were only one employee in the State or if there were several thousands.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.188" offset="732139">It's wholly unrelated also to time spent, things done or property used in the State and it's wholly unrelated to any protection, benefits or service which the State provides to our activities, related quantity, I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.675" offset="802043">It is not true, as the Washington court assumed, that once you find something that you can pin on -- pin onto as a taxable instrument that the measure of the tax is wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.790" offset="850526">Due process requires that the measure still have some relation to the size of the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.171" offset="880097">There would be no objection under due process, as distinguished from interstate commerce, to a tax reasonably related quantitatively to instate activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.499" offset="921370">For example, the employment tax of Washington is paid with respect to these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.771" offset="946448">There, there's a reasonable relation that tax is a percentage of the employees' salary and the benefits from that tax will be unemployment benefits if any of these people are thrown out of business by the activities of our competitors, will be paid to them by the State of Washington, where they live and work.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.606" offset="1013844">But the reason for this tax is the customers themselves and not any taxable activity within the State, and I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.461" offset="1097226">I find that it might -- we -- it's desirable from the State's standpoint to review briefly what it is that the State reports to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.860" offset="1138813">And then I'd like to approach the question of the characterization of the tax and consider its measure and then answer Mr. Barnes' due process contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.671" offset="1186043">Mr. Barnes' statement of facts has emphasized primarily that which General Motors does without the State and it seems to me, he lends very little emphasis upon that which they do conduct within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.677" offset="1234108">He concedes that there are manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.418" offset="1241004">But for some reason, they will not admit that they're also engaged in wholesaling activities within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.407" offset="1269008">And we insist that the facts in this record here, which are quite extensive, they are unique and they are quite detailed, illustrate fully and adequately that the tax fair did in this audit periods here in question engaged in continuous and detailed and systematic business activities within the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.632" offset="1949863">These gentlemen, as it has been pointed out, laid their primary emphasis on the details of the retail dealership.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.911" offset="1982986">They have from 12 to 30 not 30 to 40 dealers, I think the record shows.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.120" offset="2043904">But turning, for the moment, to your specific question, Mr. Justice White, the manner in which we -- sales are solicited if -- if I may use that term in -- quite broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.988" offset="2091342">The whole object, and the record discloses this and we've cited numerous references to the record, that the whole object of the activity, principally of these resident district managers, of whom there were some 27 for the three divisions with which you were concerned, is to obtain for the divisions concerned there share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.980" offset="2171277">And they did it by working with the dealers and forcing and seeking compliance with the detailed terms of the retail dealer selling agreement, which we think is a very significant document.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.920" offset="2215058">And they do it initially at the beginning of the year with the dealer by determining what that dealer's sales objective for his geographical zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.442" offset="2249122">These dealers have a geographical zone.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.027" offset="3603519">But the significance of it is, is it by its very nature, it has to be performed in the State of Washington, and it is administered principally within the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.804" offset="3638627">And now, it's true, of course, if the dealer goes down to Portland and sits down on the zone manager's office, which they frequently do, well, we can't purport to tax that.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.897" offset="3678960">And we're not concerned about that, we're concerned only with those acts that are performed within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.605" offset="3701844">So far then, instate personnel who reside there and out-of-state personnel who frequently stay, incidentally in terms of population, this out-of-state personnel would come in the State of the zone that was described by Mr. Barnes that population wise, half of the population of that area is in the State of Washington, so that it might be concluded that most of those people spend proportion amounts of their time in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.009" offset="3791391">Of course, that isn't exactly true either but their responsibilities and their efforts to the extent that they are performed within the State would run in that proportion to the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.966" offset="6583254">And they said, Justice Frankfurter I believe said that the tax by the state court's own characterization impinged upon an unconstitutional channel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.173" offset="7984044">Returning just -- just for a moment on Spector, and I don't think it deserves anything else, this -- this question of characterization of the tax and it was -- General Motors can persist and this relates to our disagreement with them over characterization of the tax which we have discussed in our brief but they persistently attempt to classify the -- our tax as something like a tax on unapportioned tax on gross receipts from interstate commerce or a tax on the privilege of doing things done almost exclusively outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.324" offset="8112671">And we just insist that the Washington courts' characterization of the tax that it is a -- a tax on -- after a privilege of engaging an instate activities has to stand and we think it wasn't in fact established and is established by this Court's affirmance of the States Supreme Courts decision in Field Enterprise, as well as in Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.750" offset="8202324">This gamut then of local business activity by which we've been discussing engaged in within the State by this General Motors personnel, Pontiac, Chevrolet and Oldsmobile with the assistance of these other facilities and personnel of other divisions is -- is all of that, in a nutshell, immune from any kind of state taxation and I -- I asked the Court to consider that question preliminary and then I would like to address myself to the measure question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.034" offset="8315486">Initially, certainly, there is, I don't think it can be denied, an incident of state taxation and that it is not a pure interstate commerce or interstate commerce per se in the nature of Nippert versus Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.101" offset="8379747">And the reason being, as I have stated early that this is a systematic and a continuous course of conduct and it results in a large volume of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.578" offset="8417677">And again, I think that Field Enterprises certainly establishes the fact as does Norton that it's not an -- so -- so much a part of interstate commerce that -- that it is immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.766" offset="8470444">So there's a taxable incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.404" offset="8480998">Now then, is the measure of the Washington tax somehow make this tax or the manner which it is operated repugnant or is it put it outside the pail of this various constitutional limitations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.420" offset="8533034">I think, it should be noted that the measure of the tax is the same for all wholesalers doing business in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.935" offset="8559156">This is shown by Goodrich.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.554" offset="8569605">The measure results in a tax, if you please, which is proportional to the results of this sales efforts and this wholesaling activities engaged in within the State as contrasted to the situation in Nippert versus Richmond, the flatfeet situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.350" offset="8644733">And as I've mentioned earlier and as illustrated by our State Supreme Court's decision in the Goodrich Rubber case as well as Norton and Goodrich, the State Supreme Court applied this -- diligently, I might add, this Court's decision in Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.401" offset="8716936">So that the measure of the tax, and we -- as we said earlier, excludes any transactions or sales, if you will, to a Washington customer with which the tax payers' instate activity had nothing to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.011" offset="10771414">We are measuring the tax by the sales which result from those business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.755" offset="10798373">But sales only to Washington customers and not including sales to anybody else and not including sales with which those activities had nothing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.403" offset="10841004">I think this is a -- this bares this question in Mr. Barnes' discussion earlier of the market state concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.159" offset="10863992">And he describes within his brief as, and did orally this morning, as something like when products are sold by out-of-state manufacturer to residents in the State, then that alien manufacturer has taken money out-of-state and so you should be a part of put some money back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.757" offset="10926373">We don't think that the lower court had anything the kind in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.386" offset="10940897">If it did, then I can't determine it by reading the opinion, but if it did, it might well had considered the market state concept that Justice Rutledge announced in his concurring opinions in Freeman and Hewit and the International Harvester versus the Department of the Treasurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.156" offset="11016025">His -- he was speaking there with the reference to difference types of taxes but the analysis still applies and he saw three alternatives in this particular situation, which -- which I note that you seemed to be concerned, that first, you could prohibit all taxes unless they were apportioned or you could allow either the producer state or the market state, but not both, or you could go along determine that factual in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.817" offset="11110588">And he said, in those opinions, he said, "I think the solution most nearly in accord with the Commerce Clause that once most consistent with its -- at least most consistent with its purpose and least objectionable for producing other evils would be the vested power tax in a state of market subject to the power of the forwarding state, also the tax by allowing credit to the full amount of any tax paid or do at the destination."</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.615" offset="11209853">Now, when Justice Rutledge was speaking, Norton and Field hadn't been decided and I think it would be well in this particular case if this Court did specifically invoke what Justice Rutledge was saying there, although we're not talking about taxing sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.207" offset="11276204">As a matter of fact, this Court may have -- we believe that you already have done so in view of the decisions in Norton and Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.995" offset="11307342">Because in the first place, the producer states, because of the doctrine of Gwin, White &amp; Prince and Henneford in subsequent decisions, cannot measure the tax by sales towards any customers any more than we can measure tax of -- GM by it's sales to Oregon customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.745" offset="11362304">And the third alternative would be a little bit intolerable for the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.975" offset="15135222">A part from my friend here among other range on the relationship of certain past or prior decisions to the facts in this case, I think there's a very sharp difference between the facts in our case and those in Field Enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.776" offset="15202513">Field Enterprises is the publisher of the Encyclopedia Britannica and what they were doing was soliciting retail sales for that encyclopedia, which is a fairly expensive retail item, taking down payments, and so on, and doing other things at that local office and there were 140 some odd salesmen producing a total of $500,000 worth of business, contrast to that with the people that we have in Washington and millions of dollars have developed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.562" offset="15325602">And the case was treated as one because it was affirmed on the authority of Norton as a case in which all the transactions interstate, though they were in character, were tied in with an intrastate business in that local office that they had there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.288" offset="15392475">Now, the counsel's reliance on Norton really surprises me because that's the best case there is on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.121" offset="15419852">Norton, I -- I collaborated this retail store and warehouse, and they had many transactions which were clearly intrastate and which a tax apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.577" offset="15461648">They had other transactions which the court, lower court held were tax because they was -- they were, in one way or another, passed through and processed by that local office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.758" offset="15510444">And this Court said, “Well, we're not going to disturb the judgment of the trial court because it's too high to separate these things out on those circumstances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.270" offset="15536462">But this Court said, “The purely interstate transactions which didn't touch that office could not be taxed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.611" offset="15569795">As a matter of fact, that office was connected with those two because that office had a corp of engineers who went around and advised their customers on the use of these complicated abrasive machines and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.702" offset="15614203">But every transaction we have involved here is a Norton type of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.779" offset="15634474">It has no relation as the trial court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.368" offset="15648893">Finding of fact Number 25 in the record at page 20 -- 56 is to the effect that there was no relation between the transactions involved here and the other divisions to which Mr. Riley referred.</text>

            <text syncTime="4567.576" offset="18373674">Alright, thank you very much, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.117" offset="18391855">I maybe getting in to the meat grinder but I would like to get back to the questions presented by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice White on this question of what we call the "preference problem", namely, tax allocation of taxing jurisdiction as between state of origin, state of market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.039" offset="18479522">Now, perhaps the best way to illustrate our point, Your Honors, is to ask this question -- let's go to the facts in Norton and ask ourselves this question, supposing that the State of Massachusetts, you remember that Norton was located in Worcester and orders were accepted there and they were filled there, so far as the disputed transactions were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.342" offset="18584743">In other words, you had, putting it roughly, an awful lot of selling activity going back -- taking place back in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.094" offset="18623718">Perhaps, so far as some transactions are concerned, even more than you had taking place in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.837" offset="18654751">So, the question, which you, Mr. Justice White, asked about Oregon, could, in that case, have been asked about Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.625" offset="18693831">Should Massachusetts have been allowed in that case to have imposed upon the selling activities admittedly taking place there with respect to the transactions which are included in the tax base of Norton, should Mas -- could Massachusetts constitutionally or should it constitutionally be allowed to impose any sort of gross receipts tax on those selling activities?</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.561" offset="18805635">And we submit, Your Honor, that the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.701" offset="18826219">We submit, first of all, that it should not be able to impose as the state of origin, it should not be able to impose a -- gross receipts tax measured by all of the gross receipts nor for that matter, should the state of origin, in this case Massachusetts, to continue on with the Norton example, be allowed to impose even unapportioned gross receipts tax, with respect to the transactions included in the tax based in Norton because that would amount to what we admit is a very bad and an unconstitutional result, namely, double taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.258" offset="18996433">That, Your Honors, is why we say that J.D. Adams versus Storen, that Gwin, White &amp; Prince versus Henneford and particularly Freeman versus Hewit stand for the proposition that the state of origin, so far as gross receipts taxes on the selling process is concerned, should have their power cutoff.</text>

            <text syncTime="4904.566" offset="19721592">Now, those taxes are apportioned and they are valid for that reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="4959.505" offset="19941439">Illinois had a tax which was treated that way, the retailers' occupation tax, one is before is this Court in Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.891" offset="19970905">But Illinois, there was still cost, it calls its tax that has corrected it and converted into a sales tax by enacting a complimentary use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.002" offset="20007372">So it's now being made a pure consumer type of tax, so it takes it out of this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.240" offset="20028374">There's also, the City of Los Angeles and I think there are some other cities and of course, New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.570" offset="20061602">But New York City's tax is apportioned on these interstate transactions.</text>
