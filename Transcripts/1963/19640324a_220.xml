            <text syncTime="34.959" offset="243231">This case, Baggett against Bullitt, Number 220, is a loyalty oath case involving test oaths as a condition of academic employment at a state university in United States, the University of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.654" offset="294013">This case presents many issues but one of them which is of paramount significance and one to which I wish to attract my attention and one to which I shall confine the bulk of my argument is whether or not these test oaths function as a prior restraint on academic freedom , freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.539" offset="405504">Specifically, does the State have constitutional power under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to require that all professors give up certain of their rights for academic freedom, free speech, association and conscience as a condition of academic employment at a state university?</text>
            <text syncTime="94.792" offset="482513">The facts of the case can easily be stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.191" offset="496097">As to the class action brought by 64 people who are intimately connected with the University of Washington, 64 of the -- of the 64 appellants, 56 of them are professors and members of the academic faculty having teaching and/or research duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.690" offset="562134">This is set forth in the record at pages 151 to 156.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.601" offset="581778">Thirty-one of the professors have tenure at the University of Washington and 25 of the professors have academic appointments usually for a three-year duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.512" offset="625455">Now, these 25 professors do not have tenure but they are not probationary employees in the usual sense of the term but instead they have a three-year appointment that is renewable for another three years at the end of which they will acquire tenure and this is set forth in the record at page 294.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.391" offset="708942">Many of the professors have security clearances from such agencies of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the United States Air Force, the Navy and the Boeing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.900" offset="750947">Of the eight remaining appellants who are not members of the academic faculty, four of them are students of the University of Washington, two are secretary typists, one is a micro-meteorologist and another is an assistant editor of the University of Washington Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.863" offset="818866">Many of the professors at the University of Washington, three of whom are before this Court today, Professor Usinger, Professor Kenneth Reed and Professor Paul Didrickson are aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.121" offset="999842">The context within which the professors assert their rights is, of course, the University of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.396" offset="1024920">It was -- it was early founded in our nation in 1861.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.694" offset="1042160">It is now in its 2nd century of academic endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.063" offset="1055640">It is older than the State of Washington having been found prior to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.017" offset="1071417">At the present time on its Seattle campus, it has the faculty of over 1500 professors, a physical plan of about 100 permanent buildings located in area of about 600 acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.470" offset="1137246">They're -- the educational research activities of University of Washington are fully described in the record on pages 89 to 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.820" offset="1166608">I should only point out that the size of the University, although it has a total of 32,000 students that the size alone is not a measure of its quality but rather the measure of its quality tends to be in the quality of its graduate students, the quality of its professorial staff and, of course, in the physical plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.562" offset="1249573">It is the 14th largest at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.033" offset="1263470">It is one of the three on the west coast that happened to be members of the American Association Universities and only 40 universities in the nation can claim this membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.117" offset="1335881">Before turning directly to the materials with respect to prior restraint, I should like to clarify two points, one, raised by the Attorney General in his reply to our brief, namely, that the definitional sections of this oath are not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.609" offset="1405785">I should like to direct the Court's attention to page 160 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.151" offset="1435982">The Attorney General's brief at page 26 argues that the definitional sections of the oath are not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.816" offset="1462627">In fact and I quote, he says, "One search is the pleadings and pretrial order in vying for a clear request that the definitional sections be declared unconstitutional."</text>
            <text syncTime="350.757" offset="1506408">Now, agreed fact 12 on page 160 states, "The other statutes material to this cause and whose constitutionality are contested here require the oath."</text>
            <text syncTime="362.101" offset="1551757">These statutes are here and after referred to as requiring the 1955 oath and it was agreed that this would be a shorthand way of expressing what follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.585" offset="1593762">And our part of the Subversive Activities Act of the State of Washington being Chapter 377, Laws of 1955, Amending Chapter 254, Laws of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.357" offset="1632841">And then following, as reproduced there, a -- the definitional sections so that it appears very clearly at agreed fact 12 that the definitional sections are before this Court and this Court will not search in vain in order to find a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.009" offset="1691460">Also, this was supported by paragraph (66) of the complaint as that paragraph is buttressed by the Appendix B of the -- appended to the complaint found on page 15 and also as buttressed by page 165 of the record and the District Court opinion on page 239 where the District Court says that these statutes are in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.094" offset="1799711">The second point I should like to make is the general one with respect to be these oaths and that is that these oaths are current and prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.515" offset="1849448">At page 245 of the record, there is a paragraph from the District Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.755" offset="1878392">I shall quote it, "These plaintiffs here are simply required to state that they do not now and will not, in the future, engaged in the proscribe subversive conduct nor become a remaining members of a subversive organization as defined in the statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="460.468" offset="1945266">That means that a professor then must swear that he now and for the future, he will restrict his activities to what's required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.714" offset="1998242">And that which is required by the statute strikes directly at the teaching functions strikes to the heart of the classroom because these also are not a search for data, they are not a request by the legislator -- pardon me, the Legislature of the State of Washington asking the professors whether or not they might be members of the subversive organizations, but what these oaths do in fact is to require that each professors give the right answer, only one answer, namely, that they are not members of a subversive organization or they are not a subversive person.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.321" offset="2132616">And then and then only will they qualify for the possibility of hiring so long as they are further substantively qualified in their disciplines.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.393" offset="2168978">So that the point I should like to make here is that distinguishing all of the congressional investigation cases, the Committee cases and the State Committee Investigation cases, these statutes do not present the question of whether or not a State may search for data and it's not before the Court and our position is, of course, the State has large powers, strong powers to search for data in a committee inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.398" offset="2296978">What these statutes do is to strike at the very heart of the teaching function.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.367" offset="2320802">Now, if I may direct to the Court's attention at page 15 of the record, I should point out what it is that was circulated to the members of the faculty at the University of Washington, that is the oath in question here, Oath Form A.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.563" offset="2401573">There are basically two oaths, one is the 1931 oath, which is reproduced in the first paragraph, and the other one is the disclaimer oath in the second paragraph.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.290" offset="10336528">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.064" offset="10347604">Honorable Chief Justice and members of this Court, I should like to speak briefly to the religious aspects, which several of you have already inquired about, that is -- is -- either of these oaths, the 1931 oath, which you have been talking about mostly or the 1955 disclaimer oath, in any way invade the free exercise of religion of these plaintiffs or indeed invade their conscience, which I believe is also protected by the -- the First Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.143" offset="10491904">And I suggest, if the Court please, that several cases of this Court point that way, that is first, Barnette, it seems to me which is cast somewhat in the complexion of this case where there was a compulsory oath of allegiance or a compulsory act whereby these children were sought to be patriotic or to be nationalistic and the Court struck this down as a violation of the free exercise of, of course, the religion, the Jehovah's Witness religion, of these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.345" offset="10632756">It seems to me that this concept has been carried forth recently here, in this Court, in the case of Sherbert against Verner, which we have not cited in our brief, although we did cite Schempp, which I think also carries forth this concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.379" offset="10696913">And it seems to me that herein, the present context of this case, we have conditioned of employment that the professor will give an undivided allegiance to the United States from oath respect for reverent -- in reverence of law and order, etcetera, that we have talked about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.890" offset="10778937">In addition, under the disclaimer oath, these professors are asked to say that they are not subversive persons or have not knowingly joined a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization, which we believed, and the professors have stated this on pages 188 and 189 of the record in an agreed statement of fact, on agreed fact, first, that they believe all of the professors, I'm now talking about all of the professors rather than two, to whom I will address myself in a moment, that all of the professors feel that the oaths are a violation of their conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.827" offset="10930657">The preceding finding of fact on page 188 relates solely to two professors who are Quakers, one of whom Professor Matchett is tenured, one of whom Professor Orians who is non-tenured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.625" offset="10985827">They have asserted that in an agreed statement -- in an agreed fact that the oath violates their religion specifically, the Quaker religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.283" offset="11028459">Now, Quakers, as I understand it, don't have an undivided allegiance to temporal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.941" offset="11055104">These gentlemen have an allegiance if we use that word of that strength or they have a feeling or a devotion or a sympathy for people, for human beings, for human needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.873" offset="11394905">These youngsters and their parents stated that it was against their religion that they not have a graven image.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.435" offset="11417161">Now, this case as in Barnette, if these gentlemen assert that they cannot sign because of reasons of conscience, their assertions of First Amendment freedoms is not running into or colliding with the assertions of anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.777" offset="11482467">Everybody else, if they wish, can take this oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.568" offset="11493648">The only persons who would not be taking it would be as in Barnette, those people who felt that it was contrary to their religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.996" offset="11527398">Now, secondly, I think that the extension, if you -- if I may so call it, of the free exercise in Sherbert takes up this case, that is if the Seventh Day Adventist in North or South Carolina, I -- feels that her free exercise of religion has in anyway been prohibited by reason of her losing her employment and not under state statute being eligible for unemployment compensation benefits, then I suggest that the condition imposed upon these professors is precisely the same type of condition and is indeed a prohibition of the free exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.465" offset="11681207">Now, question, of course, is what is religion?</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.162" offset="11696044">Does religion run over into conscience and is conscience protected?</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.138" offset="11711927">I suggest that both under Barnette, under Speiser against Randall, certainly under Cantwell against Connecticut that a person's free conscience is protected by the First Amendment as absorbed by the Fourteenth Amendment and applicable to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.125" offset="11775875">And I suggest that if this is, if it is indeed, a violation or an intrusion upon the rights of these professors, then I think that the mandate of the First Amendment should takeover even though this Court might think that this is but a limited invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.561" offset="11845569">The Court has spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.493" offset="11849331">Justice Madison has spoken in the past of the dangers of what is now a limited invasion and later maybe a torrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.534" offset="11877543">Now, I feel that the literal interpretation of the First Amendment, and I regarded as a charter of our Government, is applicable to this case that we are faced with state action and that the rights of conscience of all of the professors as opposed to the -- were limited, I may call them, religious rights of two of the professors have, in fact, been affected as by what we call an unconstitutional condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.027" offset="11983496">Now, we are not asking, I am not asking that the oaths should be declared unconstitutional as to all persons, only as to those persons who seek to raise the issue of conscience.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.711" offset="12750242">It's true that we must safeguard our constitutionally guaranteed liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.146" offset="12771976">It is also true that we must protect ourselves against the dangers of subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.897" offset="12790993">Now, having said this, we've said very little toward assisting the Court in determining case before it because what is needed is not generalities, however, true these generalities maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.191" offset="12844178">But a detailed analysis of the statutes, a consideration of the context out of which they overruled and an understanding of the statutes and how they've been applied and interpreted by the courts in our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.575" offset="12901648">Now, the course of my argument, I would like to deal first with the Subversive Activities Act, passed in 1951 as amended in 1955 and devote the latter part of the argument to the 1931 oath requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.631" offset="12965909">Well, I don't purport to go into detail in the 1951 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.533" offset="12981478">I would like to very quickly present a bird's eye view of what it requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.507" offset="13005406">As the Court knows, the Washington Legislature did not simply shoot an arrow into the blue when it passed the Subversive Activities Act of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.881" offset="13046888">Prior to this Act, the Governor of the State had requested that it be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.385" offset="13064861">Prior to the Governor's request, extensive hearings had been held by a state investigating committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.500" offset="13093386">Now, when the Act was finally passed, it was patterned in large part after the so-called "Ober Act" in the State of Maryland, consisted of some 22 sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.231" offset="13140302">The first section is, perhaps, the most important in the entire act, it's the definitional section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.917" offset="13163081">And in a few minutes, because if the importance of this section, I would like to drawback to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.543" offset="13181576">The next three sections relate to criminal sanctions and they are not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.662" offset="13206026">The following five sections relate to the appointment of a special assistant attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.412" offset="13237060">Now, these are not before the Court because four out the five have been vetoed by the Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.382" offset="13256913">The one remaining of these five sections merely requires that the Attorney General report biannually to the legislature on subversive affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.930" offset="13303097">This brings us then to Section 11 which is one of the key sections as far as the state loyalty program is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.441" offset="13337161">I'm not going to attempt to quote directly from the statutes but only to paraphrase them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.121" offset="13355865">Section 11 lays down the base rule that no subversive person shall be eligible for public employment in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.322" offset="13400691">Section 12 establishes an administrative program which places a certain amount of power in the hands of agency officials to determine whether those and their employee are subversive persons within the meaning of the 1951 Act, as amended -- later as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.062" offset="13479581">Now, Section 12 is one of two sections, which was amended by the 1955 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.893" offset="13502986">Section 13 provides that this requirement as to those who are employed, as opposed to applicants, shall not be applicable to non-sensitive areas of state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.271" offset="13560456">Now, at this point, I should advise the Court that in the entire State of Washington, I know of not one area which has been declared non-sensitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.769" offset="13602461">We say that this is evidence of the very poor level of enforcement which the Act has received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.897" offset="13630986">Section 14 requires a, what we will call, a one-shoot affidavit requirement, a disclaimer as of -- for all employees who are employed as of June 1, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.455" offset="13693158">In Section 15, sets up a rather elaborate hearing procedure for those who have been accused of being subversive persons under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.913" offset="13730983">Again, I should be frank with the Court and tell the Court that I know of not one instance on Section 15 has ever been employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.044" offset="13763584">The next section requires an affidavit from a candidate for election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.498" offset="13781347">The last section which I would like to mention is Section 19 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.195" offset="13804126">This is a key section because it is a mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.094" offset="13815724">As we see it, it is a mandate by the legislature that the Act be strictly construed with an idea of not infringing upon a person's constitutionally guaranteed liberties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3622.086" offset="14591666">So what the University said in effect, and here I'm paraphrasing it, they said, "You shall sign the oath by October 1st, demand is hereby made that you sign the oath by October 1st."</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.448" offset="14981204">I said a moment ago that the University of Washington has had a judicial umbrella in the form of an injunction virtually from the time that the 1955 Act has been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.437" offset="15033135">The result of this is that the University of Washington provides a test tube example on how a state agency might operate under the 1951 Act without the 1955 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.616" offset="15081827">We submit that the level of enforcement has been sufficiently low.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.667" offset="15101994">That checks as to an individual's loyalty have been sufficiently desultory to justify the legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="3775.173" offset="15204080">Now, Professor Reed, the Court will recall was a visiting professor from Australia, who decided to burn his bridges behind him and teach at the University of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.510" offset="15245458">Was he informed of the oath requirement prior to his coming to the University of Washington?</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.323" offset="15272626">On page 200, before the bottom of the page he says, "When I accepted this visiting appointment, I was not informed that an oath of any nature might be required to me."</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.574" offset="15313690">Less -- thus, would seem to be a mistake on page 201 about three-quarters of the way down the page, he says, "I was at no time informed that an oath of any nature might be required at me as a condition of my employment by the University."</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.547" offset="15369592">I now direct the Court's attention to a statement by Professor Birnbaum during the course of his deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.834" offset="15398745">The Court will recall that Professor Birnbaum was a member of the personnel committee of the Mathematics Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="4900.228" offset="19704247">I don't think that -- that university in every case is required to discharge an individual if he refuses to sign the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.342" offset="19732773">I can't answer your question because of the particular factual basis of it but let me take another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.799" offset="19754611">Let me take an example of whether an individual belong to the Communist Party, say several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.468" offset="19777285">And the individual attempted to resign from the Communist Party but a number of years had gone by, he no longer had contact with those individuals that he had once known, he did write a letter to somebody and yet he wasn't sure whether he could sign the oath or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.812" offset="19842591">We say that such an individual came forward, demanded a hearing and at this hearing, stated that he had written a letter to the last person he knew, he did knew whether he was still mailed back his membership card.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.640" offset="19889925">He didn't know whether he was still carried on the membership rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.175" offset="19904031">We say that if such a person would kept for employment that it might well be affirmed by the Washington State Supreme Court that ever came before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.439" offset="19937155">We say, in other words, that would not be a sham hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.828" offset="19946663">It would be a hearing with a very real meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.595" offset="19961710">Now, there are two other categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.607" offset="19973831">Not only those of academic tenure but those with civil service tenure and those who, for one reason or another, have no tenure at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.677" offset="20022105">The real significance of the Court's decision in Nostrand against Little, the real significance was the fact that the Washington Court held that they could not interpret the 1955 Act without reference to any other act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.173" offset="20080097">They took the 1955 Act on the hand and interpret it along side of the Act which gave the Board of Regent certain powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.330" offset="20108727">They read them together and came out with the hearing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.840" offset="20122728">We say if the Court did this with that particular statute, they might well compare it with another statute such as the civil service statute passed in 1951 or the Administrative Procedures Act passed in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.054" offset="20171630">They compared it with one statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="5060.108" offset="20343829">This was done at the University of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.599" offset="20353755">The personnel committee met and it passed rule -- Rule 14, which actually adapted rules and procedure which are set forth in the Civil Service Act, so this would prepare the hearing for those.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.645" offset="20406000">Now, the key question is, what about those individuals that have neither civil service tenure nor academic tenure, would they be afforded a hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.037" offset="20439542">Now, the going gets rough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.895" offset="20446960">We say that they would be by virtue of the State Administrative Procedures Act passed in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.476" offset="20477262">State Administrative Procedures Act, in Section 9, provides that in any contested case, all parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.510" offset="20541419">Now, what did they mean by contested case?</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.832" offset="20550719">Well, Section 1 defines a contested case as a proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties are required by law or constitutional right to be determined after an agency hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.377" offset="20624906">Would there be a constitutional right to a hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.078" offset="20635669">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.119" offset="20639848">We say it would be better to err on the side of allowing too much due process rather than allowing too little due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.869" offset="20666807">We propose to grant them a hearing and I don't know who can raise the question of a hearing would be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.010" offset="20699408">I'd like to add that the office of Attorney General is very much aware of the serious nature to an individual who has been discharged on security reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.484" offset="20761266">I don't know that this has ever been done but we recognized that it is serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.647" offset="20777984">For that reason, along with the mandate contained in Section 19 of the Act, we propose to construe the definitional sections very strictly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.533" offset="20829497">We propose whenever there is a doubt or a question to allow a person a hearing and a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.380" offset="20856874">We cannot meet the objections to those who feel that the loyalty act such as this is unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.085" offset="20879757">We can meet the objections of those who claim that there is a procedural deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.204" offset="20900237">We can meet the objections of those who claim that we are interpreting the Act in too broader fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.406" offset="20949034">Next, I would like to deal with those definitional sections very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.691" offset="20978186">But before I do, I've already discussed the 1951 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.837" offset="20998771">I would like to remind the Court that in 1953, the Washington Legislature amended the definition of subversive person to make the element of scienter even more explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.846" offset="21058748">In 1955, we say because it may be had been dissatisfied with the level of enforcement, the Washington Legislature amended the Act in two places and added two new sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.166" offset="21108067">Section 12, if the Court will recall, set up an administrative program.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.993" offset="21127293">As the Court knows, the first section of the 1955 Act added to disclaimer requirement that a person must disclaim his present membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.175" offset="21164074">I emphasized the word "present membership" in the Communist Party or other subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.075" offset="21195630">The second section brought us into conformity with the non-sensitive provision which was Section 13 of the original act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.087" offset="21231679">Now, the third section was a very harsh section.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.130" offset="21243904">It required that those organizations which were on the United States Attorney General's list be deemed subversive organizations within the meaning of the Washington Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.392" offset="21284968">I hasten to add that this Section was declared unconstitutional by the Washington States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.029" offset="21315480">The last section simply states that Communist Party is declared to be a subversive organization and membership is a subversive activity thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.188" offset="21364172">As far as the oath form itself is concerned, I've already stated in response to a question that the oath, so far as the 1955 portion of the oath is concerned, is made by the Attorney General's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.037" offset="21423522">It is, by and large, followed by state agencies even though there is no absolute requirement that they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.485" offset="21449331">A city or a county may choose to follow the -- an oath of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.538" offset="21469497">We have supplied them with an oath and I can say that by and large, they have adapted our oath form.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.085" offset="21491754">Now, an examination of the oath itself shows that not all of the oaths comes from the 1955 Act because the mandatory portion of the 1955 Act only requires that a person state whether he is a member of a Communist Party or other subversive organization while, in fact, more is asked in the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.341" offset="21568763">A person is asked, for example, whether he is a subversive person.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.067" offset="21583600">This stems from the 1951 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.918" offset="21607006">I'll also hasten to add that this is a request for information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.014" offset="21623411">This is not a -- a particular requirement of future behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.279" offset="21644518">The State does have a right to request this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.813" offset="21658624">It is true that under Section 12 of the 1951 Act, the State may, in the future, request more information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.537" offset="21701569">Now, I come to the key part of the 1951 Act, which are the definitional sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.266" offset="21728423">I think the first thing that is apparent when we consider the definitional sections is the fact that each definition must perform a double duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.756" offset="21766353">On the one hand, it defines a subversive organization, membership of which maybe a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.264" offset="21792475">And on the other hand, it defines a subversive organization membership in which it cause one to lose his public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.733" offset="21830301">Now, of course, it's actually a mandate that criminal statutes are strictly construed, although the criminal portions of the statutes are not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.668" offset="21862066">We say that these strict constructions, since there's only one definition of subversive organization, since there's only one definition of subversive person, since there's only one definition of foreign subversive organization, we say that this strict criminal construction benefits those who come under the loyalty portion of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.944" offset="21955166">The strict construction is, of course, buttress by Section 19 which I read to the Court earlier, the mandate by the legislature that the Act be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.357" offset="22000828">What is a subversive organization under the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.342" offset="22016711">We did not claim if these terms are self-defining, since they are defined in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.973" offset="22039280">This is one of the difficult areas of this case but I think that it is better to discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.318" offset="22064671">I will paraphrase the definition of "subversive organization" rather than read the expressed statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.279" offset="22092466">Subversive organization is any organization, purpose of which is to, to do what?</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.948" offset="22119215">To engage in a type of activities or to advocate, abet or advise a type of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.783" offset="22142516">What type of activities?</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.630" offset="22149935">Activities intended to assist in the overthrow, distraction or alteration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.922" offset="22303013">Alteration of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.924" offset="22302908">The constitutional form of Government of the United States, of the State of Washington or of any political subdivision of either of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.017" offset="22302804">Now, the definition of subversive person is a little more involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.965" offset="22302699">Who's a subversive person?</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.845" offset="22302595">According to the statute, any person who aids in the commission or advocates, abets, advises or teaches by any means, any person to aid in the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.424" offset="22302490">Commission of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.058" offset="22302386">Any act intended to assist in the overthrow, distraction or alteration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.557" offset="22309595">Answer the constitutional form of Government of the United States or of the State of Washington or any political subdivision or either of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.399" offset="22336972">How?</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.369" offset="22340838">By revolution, force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.606" offset="22349824">In addition, according to our statute, one is defined for purposes of the Act as a subversive person who with knowledge that the organization is an organization as defined on the section relating to foreign subversive organization, as relating to a subversive organization becomes or remains a member of such an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.772" offset="22442506">Perhaps the most controversial is the definition of "foreign subversive organization".</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.351" offset="22468733">This is quite similar to subversive organization except that it's further defined as an organization directed, dominated or controlled directly or indirectly by a foreign government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.911" offset="22523068">Further, although the Section does speak in terms of overthrow, distraction or alteration, we've got to face the fact that it does not have the qualifying words by revolution, force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.232" offset="22580328">Now, we interpret this to, nevertheless, mean by revolution, force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.829" offset="22598719">And by revolution, we're not talking about a peaceful revolution such as the industrial revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.703" offset="22618154">We understand revolution to be a popular armed insurrection in the sense in which it's popularly used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.624" offset="22645844">Where do we base this on?</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.741" offset="22654307">We based it on the fact that, on the one hand, it is a foreign organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5641.692" offset="22670190">In other words, being a foreign organization, it maybe less likely to rely upon normal democratic processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.550" offset="22701537">It may be more likely to rely upon an army which maybe the fist or the spirit of the foreign organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.414" offset="22729017">When the foreign niche of the organization and the fact that it may be relying upon a foreign army is combined with the words "overthrow, distraction or alteration", we feel that it is clear enough that this means by revolution, force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.143" offset="22787950">Now, this Court has often held that if will uphold the statute if it can be given a constitutional construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5678.347" offset="22816789">This portion was given a constitutional construction, we submit, by the State of Maryland with the Ober Act, which as far as the definitional provisions are concerned, are identical to those in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.061" offset="22871646">In the case of Shub against Simpson, Maryland court held that the purpose of the law referring to the Ober Act, was to prevent infiltration in our State, referring to the State of Maryland, county or municipal government by persons who are engaged in one way or another, in the attempt to overthrow the Government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.964" offset="22983241">Now, when the Gerende case came before this Court, Attorney General Hammond, I believe it was, gave the Act such an interpretation and seem to require change by violent means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.154" offset="23027963">We say if it was done in the State of Maryland, it could be done on the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.716" offset="23046248">Again, our interpretation is buttressed by Section 19 of the Act asking that it be given a constitutional interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.798" offset="23090552">Now, my final point is this, with regard to the 1931 Act, it maybe true that as the (Inaudible) said, most questions eventually come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.065" offset="23151679">This is also applicable to the 1955 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.049" offset="23163591">But that does not mean that legal questions are involved, we submit that the real questions involved are not so much constitutional questions as there are questions of wisdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.848" offset="23206745">And we say that the solution for the appellants is with the Washington State Legislature, just as a solution for those who've just like Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act, was with the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.991" offset="23263378">We say that the Legislature in the State of Washington is the proper area in which the appellants should seek their remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.776" offset="23290441">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="6227.900" offset="25014941">The point I'd like to address myself to now is who has to sign the 1931 oath?</text>
            <text syncTime="6234.445" offset="25041168">The section of the statute is very clear and by definition it says, "Every professor, instructor or teacher must execute the oath."</text>
            <text syncTime="6246.514" offset="25089442">It uses the term "professor".</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.439" offset="25101145">Secondly, on page 303 and 304, there was an actual demand and refusal made upon Professor Didrickson, an alien, a citizen of Norway.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.518" offset="25141478">The -- the President of the University of Washington, his testimony was introduced by the State, has stated that the demand of May 28th was a demand that all members of the faculty execute the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.393" offset="25216920">And what actually occurred was that we have a new president as of 1958.</text>

            <text syncTime="6302.844" offset="25314722">And as I understand it, the new president, President (Inaudible) came in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.490" offset="25333321">He simply stated that everyone has to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.061" offset="25343666">I don't know whether he planned to continue the old practice but it would appear to me that it would be misfeasance of office to have him scratching out the statutory wording of a statute of the State of Washington.</text>
