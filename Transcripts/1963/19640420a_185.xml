            <text syncTime="50.291" offset="304567">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="51.803" stopTime="449.211">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="51.803" offset="310627">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.643" offset="325987">This is an appeal by the United States and two government contractors from an adverse decision by the Supreme Court of Tennessee in an intergovernmental immunity tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.328" offset="380635">The question presented is whether Tennessee may constitutionally asses a tax upon the use of Government property in the operation of the Government's Oak Ridge atomic energy facilities, the operation for the sole account of the Government by contractors who engaged to supply managerial skills and services without risk of loss or hope of profit beyond the flat fee for their services and overhead expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.403" offset="513024">The facts of the case are essentially very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.906" offset="530996">The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 and 1954 contemplate that production facilities, like Oak Ridge, will be owned by the United States or technically, by the Atomic Energy Commission as agent for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.107" offset="595780">But they authorized the Commission to draw upon private industry for managerial skill and administrative services and the like by entering into management contract of bringing those services and skills to service for the Government's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.421" offset="677073">The identity of the contractors at any given facility may change from time to time or it maybe continuous, as indeed it has in the case of Union Carbide here.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.240" offset="724302">In the present case, Carbide and Ferguson were the contractors at Oak Ridge at all times material to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.204" offset="764217">The Carbide contract can be summarized in four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.471" offset="789295">I shall refer to it in a little more detail in the course of the argument but it's enough for now, I think, simply to mention these highlights.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.203" offset="828165">The first place, Carbide undertakes, and this is frankly the language of the contract, to manage, operate and maintain the plants in accordance with instructions from the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.643" offset="881977">The character of the work done, impart the schedule of production entirely, is determined by the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.378" offset="928893">Carbide, in effect, undertakes to run the plants, not to sell anything to the Government and except in the sense of running the plants not even to make anything that it is to deliver to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.020" offset="979466">Indeed, the contract expressly stipulates that Carbide makes no representation or warranty whatsoever and assumes no responsibility or obligation that the plants can be operated successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.441" offset="1037145">It just goes in there and supplies its services.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.913" offset="1051042">Third, I would emphasize that all the plant and facilities, all the equipment, all the materials and product belong to the Government in every substantial sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.433" offset="1105063">The working capital leave and this is supplied by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.207" offset="1120214">Carbide doesn't bring any of its money to the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.820" offset="1134634">It all comes from special government bank accounts on which it withdrew.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.048" offset="1151561">All the risks are on the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.593" offset="1165772">And fourth, it should be noted that what Carbide receives is a flat fee for performing what I call leave services.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.348" offset="1200776">The fee covers its profit and in addition, it covers salaries of corporate officials, a certain amount of backup administrative services for them in the home office and perhaps other branch offices and a certain amount of overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.514" offset="1269426">I suppose it's theoretically possible, perhaps practically possible that Carbide can increase the amount of its net income a little bit by curtailing the amount of corporate officers and services that goes to this or the amount of overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.471" offset="1337240">But that is the only conceivable way that -- that Carbide can affect its net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.503" offset="1361377">In all other respects, it's exactly like a salary and that is certainly small.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.001" offset="1387395">This was, in other words, essentially in undertaking the supply management services for a fee in operating the properties of the United States subject to such directions as the United States chose to give and for the sole use and benefit of the public or of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.792" offset="1486555">Ferguson's contract was essentially similar, although it related to modification of the facilities in the nature of construction work rather than to their operation in terms of producing products or research.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.701" offset="1558131">And it involved the kind of services that are preformed under other construction contracts.But here again, the only undertaking you will find when you read the contract was to supply services for a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.912" offset="1623019">There was no responsibility for the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.730" offset="1634304">No promise in the contract to build any particular building and indeed, at the time the contract was executed, no one knew just what the work would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.947" offset="1671189">Ferguson, like Carbide, used exclusively government property, government equipment, all the way through the operations from start to finish and government money unlike any other edge.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.737" offset="1730330">This contract was unlike other construction contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.371" offset="1748825">Indeed, unlike other construction contracts even cost-plus-fixed-fee contract that the Commission has at Oak Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.383" offset="1780903">We're not claiming that the doctrines we espouse here apply to all use of property under all construction contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.160" offset="1828028">Under these contracts there was acquired a very large quantity and a very great variety of property for use at Oak Ridge either in operating the facilities or in the modification and enlargement of the Ferguson contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="463.631" offset="1957909">I think there were some sub-contractors and there were, no doubt, some direct employees as on any construction job.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.481" offset="1985285">What I conceive that it brought to the operation was the organization, administrative organization, the managerial, the executive talent and a considerable amount of construction know-how.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.790" offset="2042546">These were really the things the AEC got from.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="487.426" stopTime="490.629">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="490.629" stopTime="598.618">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="490.629" offset="2065847">Coordinating and planning but also seeing that it was done through employees they hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.645" offset="2093955">The reason, Mr. Justice Stewart, that it was done this way instead of by the usual structure program -- contract was three-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.597" offset="2133765">In the first place, these modifications came in the course of a rapidly changing technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.309" offset="2168560">The AEC knew it was going to have to make modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.653" offset="2181935">At the time they signed the contract, they didn't really know just what it was going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.836" offset="2202728">Second, Ferguson's contract, except for one subsequent aspect of it, related almost exclusively to facilities that were in production.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.189" offset="2248077">That's why they build something new on a vacant lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.157" offset="2263960">And the work, therefore, had to be tied in very closely with the production schedules, in other words, the Carbide was doing and coordinated with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.068" offset="2311607">And then there were aspects where they didn't know just how they were going to do some of these things that they would fit in with production.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.800" offset="2350582">So Ferguson said, in effect, "Well, we'll come and do this work as you schedule it, as you tell us to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.456" offset="2377226">We will supply the know-how that a big construction company has.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.307" offset="2400632">And we will supply the executive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.438" offset="2413171">Now, you give us the property, you give us the money, you assume all of risks, you supply the working capital and equipment and we'll do this work of pooling our skill with your directions."</text>
            <text syncTime="590.699" offset="2466147">And with Carbide, as a matter of fact, looking over their shoulder too because it had to be fitted in with the Carbide's -- Carbide's (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="615.437" offset="2565099">The chemicals, the computers, all was owned and supplied we would say, I'll explain that in a moment, by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.535" offset="2617553">It was procured in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.944" offset="2631137">Part of it, the lesser part in the case of the Carbide operations, but part of it may substantial impart, was obtained by Carbide or Ferguson as agent for the United States using government money withdrawn from a special account with title being bought -- title being taken in the name of the United States and the only obligation to pay being that of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.504" offset="2745344">And that is true of absolutely everything except to few Carbide automobiles that happen to be there and even those were leased to the United States for use in this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.669" offset="2794036">That covered absolutely all the property and equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.749" offset="2818382">Now, much of this property, which was used, as Tennessee says, by this contractor, was direct procurement by the AEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.080" offset="2855685">The larger part of it, indeed, in case of the Carbide contract, it place the order, the materials, the bricks and mortar as you say or the chemicals, supplies and equipment were shipped on the AEC's directions and were used in operating the facilities or in making the modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.508" offset="2941367">What Carbide and Ferguson did was essentially what any agent would do in obtaining property for its principle and in using the property of its principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.386" offset="4552913">But it -- the privilege or rendering services is not generally taxed in Tennessee, that's the gist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.351" offset="4580812">The court below held that the sales tax could not constitutionally be levied on these sales because there were sales to the United States with Carbide and Ferguson acting as agents and it judge that Kern-Limerick against Scurlock was decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.345" offset="4660746">The court sustained the use tax upon the ground that Carbide and Ferguson had sufficient discretion to be independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.498" offset="4701393">In other words, if the court assumed explicitly that the decisive question was the question of agent versus independent contractor and then making control or discretion on this old test, it said that Carbide and Ferguson have enough discretion to be independent contractors from which it assumed it followed that the tax would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.266" offset="4804420">I think the issue here, in view of the precedents, can be very quickly narrowed to small companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.243" offset="4836394">A State may not collect, even from a third person, a tax upon the property or activities of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.832" offset="5586735">First, I would say that whether Carbide is a servant or not and the element of control, in that sense, element of discretion, is utterly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.404" offset="5628949">I think that is our first quarrel with the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.888" offset="5646921">Second, we say that the question, the true test, is to be asking in whose enterprise is the property use?</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.341" offset="5692688">Who stands to profit or lose from -- in the -- in the sense of an entrepreneur, not of a salary first, from the use of the property?</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.704" offset="5730200">Who, in other words, enjoys the fruits of the enterprise and therefore of the use to which the property is devoted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.389" offset="5760920">And we say that judged by that test, neither Carbide nor Ferguson enjoyed the beneficial use of the property in present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.582" offset="5797700">Now, if time forbids and it's going very rapidly, Mr. Kramer, who's associated with the Government in this case, will deal with the matter of control or service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.282" offset="5844511">But so far as my argument goes, it is that that element, on this fact, is quite beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.046" offset="5883591">I think the best way to get at the proposition that neither Carbide nor Ferguson enjoyed the beneficial use of this property, so as to make it taxable to them, is by comparing United States against City of Detroit and the companion cases with the facts of the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.352" offset="5964779">You will recall it in the City of Detroit, the United States owned industrial properties in Detroit and leased it to Borg-Warner, a private manufacturing business, for use in the conduct of its manufacturing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.590" offset="6029772">The Michigan statute provided that where exempt property is leased, loaned or otherwise made available to and used by a private person in connection with the business conducted for profit, then the user, the lessee should pay a tax as if he were the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.865" offset="6118797">It was held that that tax was constitutional because Borg-Warner was using the plant, in the phrase in the case, for its own beneficial personal use and advantage and this was contrasting where they tax on government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.674" offset="6186088">The facts of the case make entirely clear, if there's any doubt about it, the meaning of that phrase for its own beneficial personal use and advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.543" offset="6233527">Borg-Warner was free to use the property substantially as it wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.415" offset="6253066">It was free to carry on what business there it wanted to decide what levels of production, what it would make, what it would sell for and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.486" offset="6293295">Borg-Warner, in other words, suffered the profits -- suffered the losses and obtained profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.369" offset="6328822">Under those circumstances, to have said that the technical United States ownership of the fee or of the reversion exempted this property from taxation would give Borg-Warner, what the Court pointed out, was an unjustifiable advantage because the use of exempt property, in the Court's words, is worth as much as use of comparable tax property during the same interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.652" offset="6445955">If there were no tax on the properties, I say and as the Court pointed out, it might well give Borg-Warner a distinct economic preference, as the Court said, over the neighboring competitors as well as escaping their fair share of the local tax responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.921" offset="6511052">Now, this case, I submit, is really quite indisputably at the other end of the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.905" offset="6543026">There's no question here of a private business getting the benefit as an entrepreneur from the use of this tax-free property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.137" offset="6587956">Tennessee isn't taxing a property that is used for any private advantage in the sense that it wasn't Borg-Warner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.940" offset="6619094">Indeed, it seems to us that it is trying to raise money out of the activities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.864" offset="6650859">When you go through the contract in more detail, more detail than we have an opportunity to do now, I think this will become wholly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.412" offset="6692968">But I would like to take a minute just to point out five particular points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.381" offset="6720867">The contract -- the Carbide contract begins on page 428.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.441" offset="6745109">You'll see that the undertaking of the corporation, at the very bottom of 428, is to manage, operate and maintain said plants and facilities and to perform said work and services upon the terms of conditions and in accordance with the directions and instructions, not inconsistent with this contract, which the Commission may deem necessary or give to the Corporation from time to time then the specific plants that Carbide will deal wether mentioned, there at the very bottom of the page and speaking of the K-25 Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.716" offset="6882200">The Corporation shall manage, operate and maintain the K-25 Plant in plant C in accordance with programs that prove in rating from time to time by the Commission to produce product K-25 in the amount and that the rate required by schedules to be provided by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.203" offset="6964224">There is no obligation to produce or to sell anything, as I said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.317" offset="6992645">The obligation is on the part of Carbide to use its best efforts and that is clearly set forth in Article 9 over on page 450.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.789" offset="7058578">Second, I would emphasize that all the proofs of the enterprise, except the benefit of getting experience in rendering services, belong to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.296" offset="7108524">That's true, not only have the main province but it's through of incidental thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.103" offset="7131826">For example, all sketches, descriptions, notebooks on experiments, all kinds of papers and books of accounts and other proof, all belong to the Unites States from beginning to end and remain, Mr. Chief Justice, in the United States if at any times Carbide leaves the facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.828" offset="7218657">Again, all inventions, discoveries, any right to patent or any patents that are taken out, all go to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.467" offset="7257213">So I think it's literally true to say that except for the experience that results from the use of the property, all the proofs go to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.210" offset="7300263">I pointed out in stating the facts that Carbide cannot gain or lose appreciably even by its own skill or ineptness in carrying out contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.929" offset="7351045">All expenses, losses, all risks, all liabilities are born by the United States under Article 11 of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.467" offset="7393259">And I emphasized again that in the most literal sense, Carbide has no money or property invested here, saved a few automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.973" offset="7451251">And finally, Carbide must not only do the work as scheduled by the United States but it must do it under such directions and instructions as the Atomic Energy Commission may have given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.706" offset="7522200">We realize -- first, let me say that this case, appears to us to be as radically different from the City of Detroit case in terms of use or benefit as any two cases could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.853" offset="7582804">And second, that it comes squarely within the decision of the three-judge court involving a similar operation at Savannah River in South Carolina which was affirmed by this Court in United States against Livingston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.644" offset="7645915">Now, I realized that some of the companion cases with the City of Detroit, it involved less opportunity for entrepreneurial gain, probably the Borg-Warner had in the City of Detroit case because they involved contracts with the Government and in one instance, a cost-plus contract with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.525" offset="7733478">But the Court made it very clear that the reason the tax was constitutional was that you couldn't distinguish a business conducted from -- for private profits that's sold to the Government from any other business conducted for private proper -- property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.660" offset="7805994">And that the basis for the tax was that the individual enterprise had the right to use the property in the course of its own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.647" offset="7845909">Ferguson's situation, we submit, is essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.258" offset="7872449">It is a little harder to distinguish from an ordinary government construction contract than Carbide's arrangement is from the ordinary government procurement contract of the supplies or goods because, of course, a larger part of what a contractor -- construction contractor does is render services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.321" offset="7956668">But if one asked the essential question, has Ferguson agreed to build a building, which is what the contractor does?</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.263" offset="7992404">Or has Ferguson -- any opportunities for gain or loss, anything invested here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.620" offset="8025840">Then I think that it becomes clear that it falls on the same side of the line too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.806" offset="8054575">It would seem to us that the futility, really, of the claim that Carbide or Ferguson upholds any government property for its own use and advantage, is revealed by the appellee's own arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.634" offset="8125942">Now, the first thing appellee says is that Carbide has the beneficial use of this property because it enables it to sell its products made at the other plant to the United States for use at Oak Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.125" offset="8191875">Now, first, I think I can say without fear of contradiction that there's not a shred of evidence to support the insinuation that Carbide somehow is getting an advantage over other contractors in selling chemicals and such supplies to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.530" offset="8257494">Indeed, although I regret the record doesn't show it, this procurement from Carbide is by direct procurement, usually on a competitive bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.900" offset="8295006">The situation is no different than what it would be if General Electric or du Pont were running the Oak Ridge facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.206" offset="8324159">And in any event, certainly, the profit from the sales to the Oak Ridge facility is no part of the beneficial use of the property employed at Oak Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.036" offset="8371493">Second, the appellee say, “Well, the experience in using this property gives valuable training to Carbide's employees and officials,” and then when they're taken from Oak Ridge to other parts of the Carbide business, that is a benefit to Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.831" offset="8470653">Well, of course, the experience is valuable but the experience gained in rendering services, we submit, cannot be called the beneficial use of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.053" offset="8519555">For example, if I were at a private practice, I would consider it -- of use to my firm to send a young man to work in the office of the Solicitor General and to some other Solicitor General for a period of two or three years and when he came back to my firm, I would think my firm would be to better off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.226" offset="8600325">But I don't see how it could be said that my firm has the benefits of the use of the Department Of Justice Library or of the desk or typewriters that he uses or of books or papers or anything else.Similarly, it's argued here that Carbide receives compensation, as Mr. Justice Goldberg suggested that they weren't engaged in this as a -- out of share altruism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.967" offset="8715264">In that respect, Mr. Justice, I suggest that what Carbide does is just like any employee or official does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.175" offset="8756120">He expects to get compensated for his services and Carbide expects to get compensated for its services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.108" offset="8787780">Now, if they said that Carbide has relatively greater discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.422" offset="8817037">In the first place, I would question whether that was true if I can continue to be egocentric, I suspect that I have more discretion in relation to the use of the Justice Department Library or the conduct of government litigation in this Court than Carbide has in relation to the performance at Oak Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.605" offset="8893837">But the real point is that the item of control which seemed to be irrelevant because there is no rational connection between the element of control and the automatic imposition of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.306" offset="8960606">This isn't tax on the exercise of discretion in performing services for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.620" offset="8989863">This purports to be a tax related to the benefits of property and Carbide gets neither greater nor less benefit from the property in the sense of an entrepreneur whether it has wide discretion or some discretion, but not a great deal, or no discretion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.412" offset="9073037">It has its widest discretion in fact in the area that Mr. Justice Goldberg mentioned earlier in the direction of the employment of the workforces and its lease discretion, probably, in the use of the property and in the scheduling of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.841" offset="9150777">But in either event, it has no interest in the fruits of the enterprise and it has no investment in the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.952" offset="9179199">And I submit that the mere element of control is not something that Tennessee can tax or has really purported to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.236" offset="9224338">Now, it would seem to us that that is really the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.421" offset="9249102">But I suppose that in the exact analysis, there is one question left, that if one agrees, as I think one must, that Carbide has no beneficial use in any other sense than a government servant or employee or official, a post master, a lawyer or a chauffeur or a computer operation or a laboratory technician, then, I suppose, it might be said, strictly -- well, can't the State -- says to tax upon the privilege of rendering services to the Government and at the government enterprises measured by the value of the government property utilized in rendering the services so that the president chauffeur would be taxed on the value of the limousine, the laboratory scientist would be taxed on the value of the equipment and supplies he uses, the man who digs with a shovel would pay a tax on the shovel and the one who digs with a $50,000 crane would pay a tax on the crane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.969" offset="9523284">But first, we say, that this is simply not such a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.791" offset="9542510">It doesn't purport to be that kind of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.946" offset="9555153">At such a tax as that would be so arbitrary and capricious in its incidence because I think my illustration show that one, there'd be no relation to anything gained by the employee or enjoined by the employee and the tax that he was required to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.520" offset="9649403">That very arbitrariness suggests to me that that isn't what Tennessee is trying to do that they are trying to tax the beneficial use of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.008" offset="9683362">And we say that here, the benefits go so exclusively to the United States that this is a tax on Federal Government activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.924" offset="9723068">But if this does purport to be such a tax, we would say that it is unconstitutional for two reasons or really, because one reason or the other must be applicable and here, I come to the point about discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.477" offset="9785240">In the first place, we would say that such a tax on what was called the privilege of rendering services to the United States, measured by the value of the property that you put -- utilized in rendering the services, is really a tax on the United States and that no emphasis upon form or rather than substance could blind anyone to that point, the measures took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.619" offset="9893804">On the other hand, if it be said that the form must be decisive that we cannot go beyond saying that this is a tax on the privilege of rendering services for the United States, then we say that it's discriminatory because as it operates, no one is made to pay a tax on the privilege of rendering services to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.417" offset="9988995">The sales or use tax would be collected, it virtually -- all other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.289" offset="10016580">Now, I don't think it can be said that this is an effort to equalize taxation without falling back on the other harm of the dilemma, then it is really an effort to tax tax-exempt property or tax-exempt activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.834" offset="10074676">And consequently, we say, if the tax must be viewed in this artificial light, then it is unconstitutional as being either discriminatory or really a tax upon the United States enjoinment of its property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.890" offset="10470902">The Court -- Supreme Court of Tennessee, in determining that this use by the Government of government-owned property was taxable, rendered it's conclusion largely or based its conclusion largely, in note from its opinion, on a decision it made that the relationship which existed between Carbide on the one hand and Ferguson on the other and the Atomic Energy Commission for the relationship of a principle and an independent contractor and not a principle in agent or principle in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.210" offset="10644250">Getting back toward the question that Mr. Justice Goldberg asked a moment ago, I want to address myself for just a few moments to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.306" offset="10676642">I want to point out without reading from the contract, the force of which was read by my co-counsel here, that the Atomic Energy Commission, in awarding this contract for the operation of this great complex to the equipment and the operations at Oak Ridge, included also the operations of the atomic energy at Paducah, Kentucky and it -- under its contract, made with -- I'll talk first about Carbide, with Carbide turned over to them the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.010" offset="10811434">But how did it turn over those operations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.586" offset="10821674">In order to be an independent contractor, the person to whom the operations were turned over, must have surrendered all control except as to end results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.059" offset="10863574">There's no doubt about that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.852" offset="10870784">But what did we do here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.040" offset="10879561">They reserved -- the Atomic Energy Commission or the Government reserved the right to alter, to change, to control, a portion of that was read to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.722" offset="10914252">What did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.135" offset="10919894">This record shows that pursuant to that authority, the Atomic Energy Commission issued to Carbide and similar to Ferguson manuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.107" offset="10963780">Those manuals, numbers, I don't recall the number, amounting to several hundred pages in each one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.402" offset="10984991">And in those manuals were set out in detail what do Carbide must do, how you must handle this, how you must handle that, not just the end result of the appreciable or the nuclear materials but how we must do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.774" offset="11038490">How far did we go in that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.087" offset="11047685">They went so far, and may it please this Honorable Court, and we must remember that every item of machinery, every item of equipment, every chair down there, every automobile, every piece of pencil, every piece of paper, every pencil, every pen that Carbide used or its employees used there in the operation of this contract belong to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.075" offset="11147682">Carbide had nothing there but eight automobiles which is really -- which is leased to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.226" offset="11168266">Everything that was there that Carbide used to the last analysis belongs to the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.260" offset="13392436">Carbide went in in 1940 -- well, I don't remember the year, way back under the Manhattan District before the Atomic Energy Act and Carbide had done some similar work not quite as broad as this work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.150" offset="13443950">And then because Carbide had know-how and had experience and knew the situation, the Government went to Carbide and negotiated out this contract and it was in negotiated contract and it's been in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.691" offset="13486164">The contractor is -- I think Chief Justice asked about how long it ran, it was originally and executed back in 1946 and it was renewed again in the final long run in the 1960 then an extension later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.452" offset="13529213">There was -- it was the intention to be continued from time to time right on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.877" offset="13546872">Carbide rendered enormous services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.964" offset="13555231">You take Carbide's chemist and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.691" offset="13562128">We didn't have perhaps the time to -- and we didn't -- I mean -- I'm saying the Atomic Energy Commission, though Carbide is my client, Atomic Energy Commission needed someone to run its laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.247" offset="13604342">It employed as a part of its laboratory for that new chemical processes and for medical health and for discovery purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.821" offset="13630673">It said to Carbide, “Give us some chemists, give us some people who can understand the chemistry of this product then what do we do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.594" offset="13657736">They put that chemist into our library.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.275" offset="13688456">But before the decision is reached on what to do and how to do it, Carbide says to them, “This is what we're going to do but we do get the valuable health and assistance from these people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.134" offset="14459904">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.823" offset="14474637">I think that it's well-established, I take it that it is that a state tax is not invalid purely because the economic burden of that tax can be shown to fall upon the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.440" offset="14525106">It seems to me that principle has been to our established refute at this late date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.982" offset="14551333">In the Dravo case, the case of Alabama versus King &amp; Boozer, the Esso Standard Oil Company against Evans case and in the Michigan property tax cases to which allusion has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.246" offset="14604309">I've been a little puzzled by the absence of any reference to the second and third of those cases that I mentioned, namely the King &amp; Boozer case and the Esso Standard case because it seems to me that they control the situation presented by this case to an even greater extent than do the Michigan property tax cases, although we think that they are wholly consistent in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.569" offset="14705664">In both the King &amp; Boozer case and the Esso Standard case, I would emphasize that title to the property in question was solely and exclusively in the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.548" offset="14765537">The contractor had no ultimate beneficial use of that property whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.590" offset="14793749">The only use he had was during the time that he was handling that property and fashioning things out of it for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.726" offset="14842232">He was paid a fee in those cases in the King &amp; Boozer case that was a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract just like this one is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.007" offset="14879431">In the Esso Standard case that was a fee based on the amount of gallon each handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.967" offset="14899284">But in neither instance, it should be emphasized and it can't be emphasize too strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.871" offset="14918823">The contractor didn't have any personal interest whatever in that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.102" offset="14939826">All of it were downed to the ultimate benefit of the Government and the contractor got through with it, he was through with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.261" offset="14968456">His interest though was consistent all the way throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.796" offset="14982562">He had interest in that property so long as he was using it because that was his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.007" offset="15007431">It was Esso's business to handle and store this gasoline for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.744" offset="15026343">It was King &amp; Boozer's business to build an army camp for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.183" offset="15060093">Now, I think it's further well-established that a state tax burdening the Government will be stricken down as invalid only in three instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.963" offset="15103248">One, if it is imposed directly upon the Government, such a thing is almost unthinkable has been since M'Culloch against Maryland anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.898" offset="15138983">And certainly that's not what's happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.007" offset="15147447">This tax is not imposed upon the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.258" offset="15160404">It's imposed on a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.382" offset="15172942">Secondly, this Court has stricken down taxes which do not impose directly upon the Government itself were imposed upon one whose relationship to the Government were so close as to make it an agency relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.843" offset="15242742">In other words, if you can't tax the Government, you can't tax the Government's agent either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.957" offset="15259251">We have no quarrel with that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.888" offset="15278895">Thirdly, taxes will be stricken down if they burden the Government, if they discriminate against the Government or those with whom it deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.787" offset="15326542">We most honestly submit that these taxes are not in any sense discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.302" offset="15352560">They have not been applied in a discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.321" offset="15368652">Well, this is not a reported case, I can tell the Court that upon the authority of this case, as before us today in the Tennessee Supreme Court's opinion in it, a tax was sustained as against a contractor with a local government in Tennessee where the local government had bought the materials used and turn them over to the contractor but the contractor had no interest whatsoever in the materials that he used.</text>

            <text syncTime="4100.529" offset="16505501">Now, this Tennessee statute -- there's two places that make it abundantly clear the nature of this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.273" offset="16544475">Section 67-3003 Tennessee Code Annotated provides that every person is exercising a taxable privilege who uses or consumes tangible personal property irrespective of the ownership of that property or any tax immunity which the owner of that property might enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.809" offset="16634650">These taxes, the ones that have been imposed here, I would emphasize, are not upon procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.062" offset="16659623">They are not upon procurement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.200" offset="16668191">Now, that question is out of the way incidentally because the Tennessee Supreme Court resolved that in favor of these appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.504" offset="16697344">The Chancery Court of Davidson County, which was the trial court, held liability under the statute as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.173" offset="16736110">When the case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the -- that judgment was modified to the extent that it was held that these contractors, insofar of their procurement activities were concerned, were agents of the Government for the purpose of procurement only and that the Kern-Limerick case controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.968" offset="16823254">They held however that in the general performance of their contractual duties, they were contractors and not agents of AEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.942" offset="16859094">Therefore, the contractors' use tax, and we have another provision here which I shall read, that's the following section of the Code, it provides that where a contractor uses his tangible personal property in the performance of his contract or to fulfill contract obligations, the tax shall be paid unless it is previously been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.241" offset="16968286">Now, insofar as the Government is concerned, we have two sections of our sales tax statute that exempt the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.335" offset="17012694">Section 67-3012 exempts the State and local governments any sale to the State of Tennessee directly or to a political subdivision of the State of Tennessee made directly is exempt from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.017" offset="17071417">We have accorded the Federal Government the same advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.955" offset="17091166">In 67-3004 we specifically provide that direct sales to the Federal Government or to any agency of the Federal Government created by Congress are exempt from the Tennessee sales and use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.020" offset="17159502">We've gone further than that and make them take some special recognition of the Atomic Energy Commission and that we have exempted specifically broad categories of materials which are used there, atomic weapons, atomic weapons parts and special nuclear materials, source materials and several other categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.204" offset="17236198">We have pointed them out specifically for exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.495" offset="17253334">So I would certainly urge in all sincerity that there isn't any purpose or intent whatsoever in the Tennessee sales and use tax statute to discriminate against the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="4476.926" offset="18011094">The first one culminated in this Court's decision in Roane-Anderson against Carson where the question before the Court at that time was the effect of what was formerly the last sentence of Section 9 (b) of the Atomic Energy Act, whether that language served to exempt Carbide and certain other contractors who were involved in that suit from the Tennessee sales taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.176" offset="18128123">This Court held, construing that section that exempted the property, activities and income of the Commission, construed it to include the activities carried on by the contractors.</text>

            <text syncTime="4631.923" offset="18631032">There, if the Court please, we have a statement by the Atomic Energy Commission itself, "Congress, if you passed this legislation, you are going to cost us several million dollars a year."</text>
