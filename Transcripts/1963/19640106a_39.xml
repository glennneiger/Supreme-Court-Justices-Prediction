            <text syncTime="37.686" offset="256356">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.203" offset="266492">I was saying that the writ calls for review, a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama which in our submission poses hazards for these -- freedom of the press, not confronted since the early days of the Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.149" offset="334201">The questions presented are, in general, first, how far the civil law of libel may be used by state officials to punish the publication of statements critical of their official conduct or of the conduct of the agencies of which they are in-charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.457" offset="407449">And second, how far a state may force a newspaper which publishes a thousand miles away to defend libel actions instituted in its forum because its correspondents go there on occasion to cover news of national importance as -- for a very small amount of advertising emanates from sources in the State and a very small circulation of the paper in this instance, 394 copies of the total daily circulation of 650,000 found its way into the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.488" offset="579543">The problems arise in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.920" offset="593336">The action was instituted by the respondent, Mr. L.B. Sullivan, one of the three elected Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.164" offset="638266">It was brought against the Times and four codefendants who were then residents of Alabama, four clergymen, the Reverends Abernathy, Shuttlesworth, Seay and Lowery.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.406" offset="695213">These are the petitioners in Number 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.711" offset="712454">The complaint demands damages of $500,000 for libel allegedly contained in two paragraphs of a full page advertisement that was published in the Times on March 29th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.337" offset="774939">I should say that similar actions based on the same advertisement were instituted by the other two city Commissioners by a former Commissioner and by the then Governor of the State of Alabama, Governor Patterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.320" offset="834916">They had dominance in these other suits, total $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.763" offset="856650">But this was the first of the five cases brought to trial and it resulted in a verdict in a judgment against all defendants for the $500,000 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.779" offset="904715">Of the other cases, only the James case, the case by Mayor James has gone to trial, there was the same verdict there but that's pending on motion for new trial in the State of -- in the Alabama Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.763" offset="964693">The other three cases were removed by the Times to the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.652" offset="992278">The removal was sustained by the District Court but remand was ordered in a divided judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.084" offset="1037940">And that case involving the order of remand is also pending in this Court on petition for writ of certiorari in Number 52 of this term.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.907" offset="1469274">It was published on behalf of the Committee, the name of which is on the bottom which was called the "Committee to defend Martin Luther King in the struggle for freedom in the South."</text>
            <text syncTime="352.099" offset="1513995">Chairman of the Committee was A. Philip Randolph, the President was -- the co-chairman was Gardener C. Taylor, Dr. Taylor of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.365" offset="1563106">The other offices of the Committee are listed at the bottom of the page that includes such names as Father Ford and Dr. Fosdick.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.998" offset="1601662">The members appear under the statement, "Your help is urgently needed now."</text>
            <text syncTime="383.002" offset="1637607">Some 60 names of well-known people, actors, lawyers, clergymen, politicians like Norman Thomas and the name of Mrs. Roosevelt.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.802" offset="1712840">The object of the publication was to obtain financial support for the three needs and I'm now quoting, which was stated in the last paragraph, the paragraph beginning, "We urge you to join hands."</text>
            <text syncTime="419.104" offset="1782012">And those needs are put as the defense of Martin Luther King who I should add was then facing trial for perjury in Montgomery, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.755" offset="1840631">The funds for his defense for the support of the embattled students and the struggle for the right to vote, these are the stated goals of the solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.249" offset="1898622">The recitation in the text, these 10 paragraphs, the small type, is of course a statement designed to support this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.994" offset="1949613">The lead caption, "Heed Their Rising Voices" is a phrase that's taken from a New York Times’ editorial of some days earlier as -- is indicated at the top right hand corner where there's a quotation from the editorial, which indicates accurately the sympathy with which this newspaper has viewed the Negro protest demonstrations in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.864" offset="2073120">The text itself begins with the assertion that thousands of Southern Negro students are engaged in wide-spread non-violent demonstrations in positive affirmation of the right to live in human dignity as guaranteed by the United -- U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.866" offset="2153055">And it proceeds to claim that in their efforts to uphold these guarantees, they're being met by an unprecedented wave of terror by those who would deny and negate that document which the whole world looks upon as setting the pattern for modern freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.279" offset="2230795">Now, the succeeding paragraphs recite a series of alleged abuses visited on student demonstrators in some dozen Southern cities including Montgomery, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.362" offset="2291086">Then the paragraphs go on to praise Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a symbol and the inspiration of the movement to allege that his peaceful protest had been answered by what the ad calls the “Southern Violators” with intimidation and violence designed to remove him as a leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.893" offset="2381156">They urged the importance of defending Dr. King and the need of a material help by those who, in the language of the advertisement, are taking the risks facing jail and even death in glorious reaffirmation of our Constitution and its Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.852" offset="2460986">I suggest, therefore, that the text was thus a statement of protest, that ad coelum interwoven to be sure with a recitation of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.191" offset="2514381">But it names no names but Dr. King's and plainly makes no personal attack on any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.036" offset="2549803">And reading it in this way, the -- noting the prominence of the name to some of the signatories, the employees of the Times who received it, received the copy and the order for its publication from a New York advertising agency who received it of course in New York, approved its publication as what is called a newspaper parlance in editorial type advertisement, and so that publication appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.711" offset="2700477">Now, the respondent claimed in the complaint and the Court and jury found that he was libeled by the third paragraph of the advertisement, the paragraph that begins in Montgomery, Alabama and by the first eight lines of the sixth paragraph, at the bottom of the middle column, the words that begin again and again, "The Southern Violators."</text>
            <text syncTime="679.621" offset="2824089">Those were the portions of the advertisement set forth in the complaint in which the action was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.945" offset="2869437">Turning from the complaint to the record, the respondent's evidence showed that this third paragraph beginning in Montgomery, Alabama was indeed inaccurate in some particulars and I would like to state as faithfully as I can, what those inaccuracies were.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.703" offset="2964418">It was shown by the evidence which I might say consisted and it's a very imposing record which proves to be much less difficult than it seems because a great part of it consisted nothing but the reproduction of newspaper stories that were published by the New York Times in which the respondent's claim showed it was doing business in Alabama but about at least half of these five volumes consist of nothing but those stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.135" offset="3086149">The -- the evidence in the libel action was all in the second volume and it doesn't run to more than -- than a couple of hundred pages actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.217" offset="3134528">It might be -- be helpful if I said that it runs from pages 567 to 818, the whole case on the merits is in those pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.470" offset="3195550">Now, I say the respondent's evidence which consisted principally of reports that were made to the New York Times by its investigators after this controversy started and the suit was threatened or instituted, the Times had Claude Sitton, it’s Atlanta correspondent and a lad named McKee, who was a stringer in Montgomery, investigate what had happened and these reports came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.509" offset="3323654">They were then obtained on discovery by the plaintiffs and put into the record and they really constitute the -- I shouldn't say the whole because the respondent cuddles with this, but I say the heart of the case as to what actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.233" offset="3402544">Now, what it shows is that there was a big demonstration in Montgomery, a thousand students went down from the Alabama State College, the Negro College there, went down to the Capitol steps as a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.471" offset="3471507">And massing on the steps, they said the Lord's Prayer and sang the Star-Spangled Banner and then they walked back to the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.591" offset="3511945">This was a protest against the earlier denial of lunch counter service in the courthouse building to some 30 students who had demanded service.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.925" offset="3705355">I believe the minutes of that meeting showing their expulsion also appear in the record, they were proven independently by another witness by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.246" offset="3762616">And of course when the expulsion took place, there was a student strike in protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.596" offset="3788007">That I think is consistent with what the paragraph says but the statement was inaccurate in saying as it did that the students refused to reregister.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.495" offset="3855612">They didn't refuse to reregister or at least only an infinitesimal number may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.448" offset="3883406">And they -- more than that, the ad was wrong in stating that their dining hall was padlocked in an attempt to starve them into submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.072" offset="3937950">There's no evidence that the dining hall was padlocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.558" offset="3955818">The evidence says that it was not padlocked and of course, there was no attempt to starve the students into -- into submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.507" offset="3995628">And reverting to the first sentence which says that truckloads of police armed with shotguns and teargas ringed the campus, the evidence doesn't show that the police ever ringed the campus and that a literal sense, it shows that they were deployed near the campus in large numbers on three occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.865" offset="4101058">Their armament is not shown by the record one way or another and that it is true that after a subsequent, in a period of a few days, there was another demons -- student demonstration, this time on the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.570" offset="4159886">And the superintendent of grounds called the police and they came in, the students had grown rowdy and they made some 32 arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.500" offset="4211609">The arrested students subsequently the record shows pleaded guilty and were fined in varying amounts for minor crimes like disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.680" offset="4256330">Now, if I turn to the sixth paragraph, the Southern violators' paragraph, I have to say that it was shown by the evidence to be a lot more accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.003" offset="4301679">Dr. King's home had at that time been bombed not once but twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.062" offset="4325920">One of the bombs failed to go off, the other did go off, he and his wife were home at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.216" offset="4354446">He claimed at least to have been assaulted on one occasion when he was arrested, though the arresting officer denied that there had been a physical assault and there was a controversy in the record about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.476" offset="4403556">And he was arrested not seven times to be sure as the other paragraph says but it was established that he was arrested four times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.010" offset="4453711">And as I said earlier, he, at this very time, was charged with perjury and an indictment in two counts that did indeed carry a potential sentence of 10 years if he'd been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.825" offset="4500941">He was in fact subsequently acquitted of that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.449" offset="4519435">Now, these are the essential facts about publication that the courts below held unprotected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.986" offset="4557574">Now, I come now to the theory, I -- I shall not permit myself to call it evidence that was relied on to sustain a verdict that these statements to which I've called attention libeled this respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.243" offset="5702573">And he specifically, the Commissioner of Public Affairs and as such, his jurisdiction includes the supervision of a number of departments, police, fire, scales and cemeteries being the four are in -- as the record indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.167" offset="5770283">He doesn't supervise the police force daily in the sense as the police chief does and there is a police chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.963" offset="5797450">But the police chief reports to Sullivan and he's responsible himself or to Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.936" offset="5817408">So it's something like the relationship between -- in a large city between the police commissioner and the mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.463" offset="5847501">Commissioner is in-charge of day-to-day operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.875" offset="5861084">The mayor is his boss, in-charge of the whole show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.744" offset="5880624">Now, Commissioner Sullivan testified and what he said was quite simply that he felt that the statements in the advertisement that referred to events in Montgomery reflected on him, on the other Commissioners and on the whole community.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.643" offset="6568167">Now, as far as the sixth paragraph is concerned -- oh, I -- I do want to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.273" offset="6590737">So far as the padlocking statement is concerned, I submit that from the context and this is the real grievance about this paragraph incidentally, the padlocking, I submit that that grievance has just absolutely nothing to do whether respondent did this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.325" offset="6666910">If anybody has a grievance about it, it's the state authorities that are -- they referred to him those words and not the Commissioner of the City of Montgomery or any other local authorities even if this theory of reference to the individual could be accepted which I deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.765" offset="6748725">And the sixth paragraph of course makes no allusion to Montgomery at all as I indicated earlier in response to Mr. Goldberg's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.978" offset="6785506">And the only reference to the police is on the seven arrests which was wrong, it should've been fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.816" offset="6812882">Now, we urge below and we argue here that such a reference is that to the police cannot be read as an allusion to the respondent as Commissioner in-charge in the context of prosecution of an action for libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.153" offset="6890204">But even if it could, what I have said, I think makes clear that any evidential basis for the claim of falsity must rest on very small discrepancies indeed between what was said and what the record shows to have been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.737" offset="6976618">Now, at this point, I think I should recognize that the respondent takes a wholly different view what this case is about and I wish to state his view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.114" offset="7026041">He says that the claim of libel was at the -- this publication charged Commissioner Sullivan with padlocking the dining hall, with bombing Dr. King's home, with assaulting and arresting him, with charging with perjury and indeed with everything that happened except that for some reason that I don't quite understand, he makes an exception for the expulsion of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.176" offset="7134293">He acknowledges that that was the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education and he doesn't take that to allude to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.663" offset="7172327">When it came to the testimony about this reading of this document, which I submit is fantastic, the respondent merely said that he considered that since these statements appeared in paragraphs that contained a reference to the police that they all referred to the same people or at least could reasonably be taken to refer to the same people and that he did take them to all refer to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.234" offset="7306596">And accepting this theory, the trial court permitted him solemnly to prove that he hadn't really bombed Dr. King's home and that the police in fact had done everything they could to solve that atrocious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.270" offset="7390711">Had worked overtime on it and so on which of course was not challenged by anybody and counsel for the defense called in this position, found himself saying, "Well, we don't claim that this was true."</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.976" offset="7457584">And of course, they didn't claim that it was true that Commissioner Sullivan bombed Dr. King's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.467" offset="7495514">On the contrary, what we claimed and claimed throughout the trial was that the -- this piece of paper couldn't be read to make the charge that Commissioner Sullivan had bombed Dr. King's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.973" offset="7545564">Now, I don't think any of the other facts in the record add significantly to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.128" offset="7570120">The Times did retract the -- these two paragraphs formally at the request of the Governor of Alabama, the then Governor, Governor Patterson who claimed to have been libeled and the Times published their retraction saying that they didn't intend to imply by this statement any misconduct on the part of the Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.113" offset="7682133">In explaining why they did this, they said they did it in deference to the high office that he held as -- as Governor of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.200" offset="7826433">Now, Times didn't apologize to the respondent and indeed when he wrote a demand for a retraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.144" offset="7862169">The Times' counsel replied that so far as they could tell, the third paragraph of the ad was accurate except for the padlocking statement and they couldn't see how that or anything else referred to Commissioner Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.094" offset="7934058">And they asked to let him know if he would, how he did feel that it referred to him and of course he brought suit at that point instead of undertaking correspondence and that didn't surprise the Times which knew that he wanted to bring a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.549" offset="8019844">The only other thing is that at the trial itself, Harding Bancroft, who was then Secretary of the New York Times, repeated what in substance had been said in the interrogatories earlier that while it was very hard to say what the New York Times thought about the truth of these statements since the Times is a large enterprise composed of many individuals that he could say that of all the knowledge that the Times had was embodied in these reports to which I have referred and that is, he read them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.592" offset="8187968">He considered that except for that padlocking statement, the material was generally the general tenure of the material was substantially correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.223" offset="8234570">And of course, the Supreme Court of Alabama made a great deal of this testimony of Mr. Bancroft on the appeal and viewed it as the, I should say the prime basis for sustaining the punitive award.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.436" offset="13179341">And indeed, Madison himself observed that if the law of libel hasn't been wise where it had been enforced, we'd never have had a Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.788" offset="13220823">Then it has been the point throughout the history of law that these provisions are not enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.953" offset="13285398">But my further points are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.341" offset="13298982">First, that even if -- even if I'm wrong, you have then a situation here where law should surely attempt an accommodation of conflicting interest, the interest in protecting official reputation and the interest and freedom of discussion, but there is no accommodation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.404" offset="13383200">The qualified privilege rule might, is one way to work out an accommodation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.985" offset="13493542">And then thirdly, on this point, we have of course the submission and we think there's a constitutional submission that there was in this record no evidence sufficient to support a finding that these particular statements in this particular advertisement threatened the -- this particular respondent's reputation in any tangible way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.987" offset="13613600">And since that is the finding which justifies on this assumption, the suppression of a constitutionally protected freedom, we submit that the normal scope of Supreme Court review as to the facts on this obtains.</text>

B. &amp; Q. which we've -- again, Chicago which we've cited in our brief Your Honor and other -- many other cases say that the protections of the Seventh Amendment which surround the reexamination of jury verdicts apply equally to state jury verdicts as they do to federal jury verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.600" offset="18128082">That was the point that I had in mind sir, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.060" offset="18149920">The answer to the demand for retraction admitted at the outset that one of the serious charges contained in the ad was false, namely that the dining halls had been padlocked but there was a refusal to retract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.550" offset="18211778">This refusal to retract came, the evidence shows after an investigation made by a string correspondent in Montgomery in which he outlined the falsity of these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.715" offset="18268516">There was still a refusal to retract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.556" offset="18283876">Then the lawsuit was filed and after certain procedural matters were out of the way, motions to quash and demurrers, the Times filed six separate pleas to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.498" offset="18335599">Not one of those pleas, not one of the six had the slightest suggestion in it that this ad was true in any particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.164" offset="18374260">Mr. Wechsler made the argument that it might be difficult for the Times to plead truth because it might have to spell out its theory that there was some question in its mind as to whether the ad applied to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.439" offset="18427341">But we would like to call the Court's attention to the scope and detail of one of the pleas, pleas six which appears on page 102 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.338" offset="18462972">A plea which extends for almost three and a half pages of the printed record of this case, a plea which sets out the entire law of New York on libel, cite statutes as well as judicial decisions on the theory that the law of New York as a matter of choice of law should be applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.902" offset="18545205">There was no difficulty in pleading truth in this case, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.042" offset="18561819">If the Times had felt this ad was true or any part of it was true, it could've set that out in its plea but it did not do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="5163.558" offset="20759866">He advised the Times that the first paragraph to use his words, was virtually without foundation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5190.908" offset="20869267">The Times in its retraction stated that there were errors and misstatements in the ad and accordingly, it was retracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.264" offset="20914720">It didn't specify that any part of it was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.220" offset="20926528">It retracted the whole ad and it didn't simply apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.520" offset="20943664">As I say, it stated that there were errors and misstatements in the ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.637" offset="20964144">Then six months later as -- almost, when this case came to trial, the Times with no plea of truth, with these investigations in the record, with live oral testimony from witnesses including the respondent that the matters were false, with the judicial admission, we submit of a failure to plea truth which is an absolute defense regardless of motive under Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.812" offset="21072918">This matter went to the jury and the jury found that it was false.</text>
