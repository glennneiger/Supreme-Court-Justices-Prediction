            <text syncTime="25.678" offset="206033">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.028" offset="219512">This case is here on appeal from a statutory Three-Judge Court, sustaining the validity of section of 321, 352 A1 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.528" offset="281475">That Court granted a judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.492" offset="309373">The issue is the deprivation of the appellant's citizenship under the McCarran Act, the 1952 Act mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.986" offset="355349">It's a new statute, involving 1952 reaffirmation of a statute passed in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.525" offset="393488">It is the sole substantive discrimination against naturalized citizens in the entire history of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.946" offset="431208">It removes the appellant's citizenship because she is living abroad with her husband who is not an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.718" offset="478229">This is an act for which citizenship is not removed from native-born citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.278" offset="512502">We assert here that the statute is invalid for discrimination under the Fifth Amendment and on various other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.028" offset="555447">The statute Section 352 A1 and A2 companion section are part of a statutory scheme, which have a conclusive and automatic termination of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.675" offset="622111">They provide, in a statute which applies not to native-born citizens but only to naturalized citizens, that a naturalized citizen who resides for three years in the country of origin or for five years in any other country, automatically loses citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.249" offset="724407">This provision as stated before does not apply to native-born citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.457" offset="753246">There are a number of exemptions to mitigate the harshness of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.373" offset="784906">Those exemptions provide that in certain circumstances, which Congress has provided as a matter of grace, a naturalized citizen may attain the same right to live, to work anywhere else in the world that he or she would have had if born in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.375" offset="880828">That is, it takes the second class citizen and says if he had behaved himself well he will get the same rights as the born citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.858" offset="918758">Thus if he has fought in the armies of the United States during war time he then receives, as a special reward from Congress, the privilege to be treated as though he were a native-born citizen and the privilege to live abroad, it happens in this case that he may live abroad only in a country in which he was not originally a citizen and no matter how distinguished his service or how many awards, he may not live in the country from which he came, but the statute nevertheless awards by a series of exemptions for special good conduct or special circumstances warranting the mercy of Congress, an exemption from the statute and persons who are naturalized citizens living aboard may not be expatriated if they come within the special exemptions who are generally residents abroad for three years in the country of origin or five years in any other country, automatically cuts off by this statute the connection of that person with the United States and he or she is deprived of citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.708" offset="1310177">They are in the law and they are printed in extenso in the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.952" offset="1335150">They are in section 353 and 354 of the statute and they appear at pages 76 and following pages in our principle brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.035" offset="1391470">Now, the facts of this case are enlightening as to the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.863" offset="1418846">Angelika Shaffer, as she was then called, was born in Germany in the year 1934 in a small village in Bavaria.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.516" offset="1461478">In the year 1939 she came with her mother, her father, her two brothers, a half brother and a half sister, the entire family, to the United States where she was admitted for permanent residence with her whole family in the year 1939 when she was not quite five years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.105" offset="1563773">In the year 1950 when she was 16 years of age, she was duly naturalized, derivatively through the naturalization of her mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.383" offset="1608913">She received a certificate of naturalization shortly thereafter and there is no question that she is a truly naturalized citizen, naturalized in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.136" offset="1671920">Between the time she came to the United States in 1939 and the time she was naturalized she went to public schools in the neighborhood of New York City, the high school and at the time of her naturalization in December 1954, in 1950 she was a freshman at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.620" offset="1769827">She duly was graduated from Smith College in the year 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.943" offset="1795114">Then a New York Institution, the New York Institute of International education offered her a scholarship to study in Bern, Switzerland at the University of Bern.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.262" offset="1852374">At the time all her relatives were not only residents of the United States, but American Citizens, the people with whom she came, her mother and father since being dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.181" offset="1892080">Mr. Kernic, co-counsel here is her uncle and a member of the New York Bar on the occasion of her leaving to study in Switzerland gave a farewell party for her.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.635" offset="1941922">To this farewell party Mr. Kernic invited a young man he had just met, a young German student who was in the United States on a Fullbright research scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.101" offset="1999809">He was studying at New York University, he was working with the New York Trademark firm of Langner, Parry, Card and Langner and Mr. Kernic thought he would be a nice fellow to invite.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.685" offset="2046098">It turned out to be a good judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.463" offset="2061249">Angelika Shaffer met in Nutley, New Jersey her future husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.450" offset="2093223">At that time he was, just arrived in the United States intended to stay for a year, she was studying in Switzerland, they made tentative arrangements that they might meet after their various foreign tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.821" offset="2154663">(Inaudible) she went to Bern for two semesters and incidentally her only connection with Germany since the time that she had come here with her family in 1939 as a child of five was to get to Bern, Switzerland she had to go through Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.391" offset="2212968">She did not stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.437" offset="2221119">After her two semesters at Bern she went to study at the Sorbonne.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.847" offset="2250794">From Bern, Switzerland going to the Sorbonne she went through Germany again and on this occasion she met Dr. Schneider who had returned from his Fullbright year in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.291" offset="2312547">She then frequently came to visit Mr. Schneider, to be with Mr. Schneider in Paris and while she was student at Sorbonne they became engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.616" offset="2361866">Finishing her studies then she came back to the United States, took employment and lived in Nutley, New Jersey with her uncle until a marriage date was set.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.133" offset="2403871">In June 1956, she left the United States to be married, on July 4th 1956 in Cologne, Germany, and she has had her residence in Germany with her husband ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.227" offset="2472312">She has, she had before the events which gave rise to the litigation, two children, one born in 1957 and the other in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.786" offset="2514526">In the year 1959, the government of United States through it's consulate in Düsseldorf stated that Mrs. Schneider was expatriated because she had resided for three years in Germany, interrupted only by a brief visit when she had her first child, she came back to the United States to show up her first born to her family, but outside of that she had resided and still resides continuously in Cologne, Germany where her husband is practicing law and is a member of a leading law firm in Cologne.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.905" offset="2742941">They kept the passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.066" offset="2747643">They crossed out her photograph and returned it to her as valid for her two children then aged two and one, who may travel as American citizens being American citizens as the children of an American citizen at the time they were born.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.139" offset="2903960">That particular possibility was foreseen by the Congress and foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.538" offset="2933530">The definition of residence appears on page four of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.113" offset="2955786">It's Section 101 of the McCarran Act and it says “The term residence means the place of general abode.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.655" offset="2985984">The place of general abode of a person means his principal actual dwelling in fact without regard to intent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="728.081" offset="3015659">Residence shall be considered continuous for the purposes of Section 350 and 352, and we are talking about 352 here of this title where there is a continuity of stay but not necessarily an uninterrupted physical presence in a foreign state or states outside the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.121" offset="3391822">In 1950, she surrendered it under protest, a letter from Mr. Kernic to the effect of the protest is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.821" offset="3426617">Thereafter she was served with a certificate of the loss of nationality of the United States issued by the state department, originally issued by the consulate in Düsseldorf and affirmed by the state department in Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.493" offset="3657331">There were various discussions, representations were made and finally after much difficulty and trouble she obtained a piece of paper which allows her to remain in Cologne with her husband, a temporary residence permit as a stateless person in Cologne.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.942" offset="5283192">The two things that are not in issue are the good faith of the nationalization originally in her actual loyalty to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.524" offset="5325511">The statute makes no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.335" offset="5336691">It takes away the citizenship of a person who was naturalized in good faith and accepted citizenship in the United States in good faith and it applies no matter how much after the naturalization and no matter how long after and under what different circumstances and it applies independently of the actual loyalty of the person to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.021" offset="5439404">It's perfectly clear that in the year 1950 when Angelika Schneider as a freshman at Smith college was naturalized that she had no idea or intention of marrying D.D.

            <text syncTime="1350.769" offset="5506487">So her naturalization was accepted wholeheartedly and without any condition and qualifications and it is not subject to attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.191" offset="5540133">If it were subject to attack it would be a different story, there are many grounds for attacking naturalization obtained with reservation and I shall come to those later, but it's perfectly clear her naturalization was accepted in good faith and if he intended to stay in the United States and complete her education and do whatever else a young girl would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.000" offset="5631352">Also, not in issue was her actual loyalty to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.548" offset="5645563">She has proclaimed it in her affidavits here which are un-contradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.335" offset="5668760">She has also proven it by the fact that she has not accepted what has been suggested, it is an easy way, why don't you accept some other citizenship, German citizenship is easy to obtain, she has refused it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.137" offset="5719960">Now, both the government and the majority opinion of the District Court below have some doubts about this judgment, for the majority below raises a question that there is nothing in the record to show that Mrs. Schneider has performed any of the duties of American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.911" offset="5803029">Now there is no specification of what duties of American citizenship she was supposed to have performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.147" offset="5835943">There is no indication that there is any basis any charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.343" offset="5852766">The statute makes this irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.338" offset="5860707">If the government were to charge that Mrs. Schneider had failed in any responsibility to the government of the United States it will of course be necessary for them to present specifications and to give her an opportunity to meet them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.816" offset="5918595">We asset that the record is clear that she has met every obligation of an American citizen and that there is no obligationship of American citizenship which cannot be imposed upon her and which she cannot be compelled to perform merely because she happens to be residing outside the physical limits of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.547" offset="6005530">Allegiance to the United States is not something which requires physical presence on our soil, subjection to our laws, also that's not required, physical presence on our soil.</text>

            <text syncTime="1513.962" offset="6159235">They have taken away her right to be a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.526" offset="6177520">I don't think we have to elaborate too much on that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.002" offset="6199359">This Court has talked about it in many terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.379" offset="6216913">The Trop case held that taking away that right was cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.043" offset="6239587">They have been described as the total destruction of the individual status in organized society.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.614" offset="6381798">I say, every member of this Court has associated himself with some or all of those remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.270" offset="6420459">Now that right cannot be treated we say the way a right of lesser consequence can be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.580" offset="6461733">The Court below thought the cafeteria workers case against McElroy was relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.372" offset="6484825">They said if you can classify between various people and say these people can come work in the cafeteria in the Navy yard, and these people cannot then it's alright to say that these people can be citizens and other people cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.479" offset="6541249">We say that whatever the conclusions of the various members of the Court maybe on that case we say this is a different matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.371" offset="10068825">And their problem was what shall we do about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.987" offset="10083349">We do not believe that it's appropriate for the government of the United States to extend protection to people who are only, as they stated, nominal citizens and people who are really Turks or Greeks or whatever else and are not really Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.126" offset="10151894">So they adopted one statute, they adopted a statute in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.365" offset="10172792">Now from the beginning of our republic it has been the law that you have to remain in the United States five years before you are naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.858" offset="10206856">So that anybody who is naturalized in the United States in the normal case has invested five years in his life in living in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.552" offset="10237576">In 1906, to avoid a possibility that somebody might come here for five years and then go away, a statute was adopted which provided that anybody who left the United States within five years of naturalization would have to explain why there was a rebuttable presumption that if you left the United States within five years of your naturalization that you had intended at the time you were naturalized not to stay in the United States and that the promises you made at that time were false and that your naturalization would be revoked and this was an attack on false naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.760" offset="10414373">This court in the Luria case sustained that presumption and said that's fine of course as you get close to the five years, you have to have more conclusive proof but this is an individual matter and as a presumption it will stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.518" offset="10477484">So that now, in 1906 when that statue was passed it was clear that a naturalized citizen at least was pretty well taken care of, he had five years that he had to invest before he became a citizen and five years afterwards where his naturalization was subject to question, but that wasn't only question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.448" offset="10557210">The question is what happens if you have somebody who has been a citizen for a long time, born or naturalized, who may even naturalize here and lives here 30 or 40 years and goes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.722" offset="10610291">What do you do in that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.069" offset="10619695">Now the state department thought this was a problem which applied to both born citizens and naturalized citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.840" offset="10650728">In connection with the statute which was the five year presumption statute, a study was requested by the state department and the state department suggested a rebuttable presumption applicable to both born and naturalized citizens that long time residents aboard should be the subject of a presumption of intention to give a citizenship and should be subject to rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.264" offset="10756472">In the course of consideration of this proposal by the state department in 1907, the Congress -- the statute came out applicable only to naturalized citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.999" offset="10819375">And it provided that a naturalized citizen who lives two years in the country of his origin or five years in another country, should be presumed to have lost his citizenship and that this was rebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.835" offset="10878725">This statute was construed, one as not taking away citizenship but only as governing diplomatic protection although the language seems talking in terms of citizenship, the attorney general in the court said, “Of course Congress was considering only which citizen should be entitled to diplomatic protection and not actual citizenship.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.978" offset="10959287">In addition to which as this court said in the Gay case, it was a presumption easily rebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.133" offset="10983946">In substance it was a census provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.657" offset="10993977">We've said we have a great many citizens living abroad born and naturalized, in this case naturalized, we want them to announce themselves every so often as to whether they intend to remain citizens and if they announce themselves -- in the Gay case all the gentleman had to do was to appear at the Swiss consulate say here I am and I want to remain an American citizen and that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.378" offset="11084884">Now nothing happened from 1906 until 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.819" offset="11118634">The state department came before the Congress and said, we are having a lot of trouble with these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.557" offset="11149563">We present you 13 typical cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.217" offset="11160221">We don't know how to decide whether a fellow is or is not entitled to diplomatic protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.094" offset="11187702">It involves great difficulties and we wish you the Congress would relieve of these responsibilities and adopt an absolute rule, an absolute rule that if somebody is a resident, three years in the country of origin or five years in another country and he is a naturalized citizen, he loses his citizenship absolutely and then we don't have to bother about them anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.014" offset="11279444">They said we know that of course we can make determinations in individual cases, but they said, if we make determinations in individual cases, the court proceedings that will be burdensome, cumbersome, time consuming and expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.351" offset="11352795">And we want you the Congress of the United States to relieve us of the burden and expense of individual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.370" offset="11388844">And the Congress obliged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.931" offset="11399084">We say that the Congress had no right to do that, that the constitution prohibits dealing with a basic right like citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.466" offset="11433253">On a basis which is an absolute presumption, the presumption in fact here are disloyalty, of lack of allegiance, just because it would be as the official indicated burdensome and expensive for them to find out whether in individual cases this was just or unjust --</text>

            <text syncTime="2893.162" offset="11675982">The only problems they created was that the government officials would have to sit on decide these questions and they didn't want to decide whether -- now what happened -- another thing that this statute did in 1940 and now in the 1952 act it not only made presumption, the rebuttable presumption of the 1970 statue conclusive, it also applied not just a diplomatic protection but the citizenship so that if as some of the 13 cases were, a citizen who is subject to the statute and excluded by wanted to come back to the United States he could not, under the 1907 statute at any time you could come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.449" offset="11861138">But this statute made a conclusive presumption and said you could never come back except as any foreigner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.274" offset="12296443">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.253" offset="12308355">I would like to dispose at the outset of the appellant's contention which counsel did not reach in oral argument and which is contained in our brief, that this case is governed by the Court's decision last term in Kennedy versus Mendoza-Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.447" offset="12373138">That is that this statute is a penal statute and therefore it violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.524" offset="12405426">The short answer to this is -- this statute is not a penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.682" offset="12422144">There is not the slightest indication of a legislative history, not even a -- not a word or a sentence to indicate that it is a criminal statute or that it was intended to deter or to have retribution or to have any of the other attributes of a criminal statute and aside from the legislative history, we believe that it is unbelievable to think that Congress would have imposed criminal penalties on a neutral act such as mere residence abroad which is not criminal and is not immoral and is not reprehensible in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.402" offset="12573027">I would now like to turn to what are admittedly the serious constitutional questions which are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.622" offset="12601866">As we see it there are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.082" offset="12611688">First, whether Congress has the power to expatriate American citizens because of prolonged residence in the country of their origin on the basis of Congress' power over foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.215" offset="12664247">And the second question is whether it is a denial of equal protection of the laws insofar as this principle applies to the federal government through the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, to provide that expatriation of naturalized citizens without providing for the expatriation of native born citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.095" offset="12739793">Before I consider the legal arguments on these two questions I would like to turn to the history underlined Section 352 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.160" offset="12780022">To be frank I do not recognize the history as it is described by the appellant's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.870" offset="12802800">This history extends back to English common law and I think it's also relevant as this Court has indicated in the previous case to look to the experience of other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.187" offset="12844074">Therefore we'll just summarize the materials which are described in considerable greater -- considerably greater detail in our brief and which even the brief is only a summary of the really overwhelming evidence that foreign problems, foreign affairs problems underlay this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.711" offset="12918262">In English common law, a citizen had no right to renounce his citizenship at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.840" offset="12938742">This was the so called principle or perpetual allegiance, but this principle was not reciprocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.435" offset="12965073">Not only were conditions often placed in grants of citizenship, but England had statutes which provided for expatriation for various conduct, including for prolonged residence abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.245" offset="13020348">Now these principles were partially refracted in the American Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.573" offset="13037693">As in England, the political rights of naturalized citizens are limited in the American Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.954" offset="13063189">No naturalized citizen may ever be President of the United States and he may not sit in the House of Representatives or in the Senate for seven and nine years respectively after naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.563" offset="13113657">While Madison and Hamilton opposed these provisions at the constitutional convention, they did so on the ground that the provisions were unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.263" offset="13152423">They said, in Madison's words, Congress has the right of regulating naturalization and can by virtue thereof fix different periods of residence as conditions of enjoying different privileges of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.541" offset="13213550">In the first Congress, in debate on whether residence should be required prior to naturalization, Congressman White said that if this requirement were omitted naturalized citizens should be expatriated who left the country and stayed abroad for a given length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.210" offset="13292231">When another congressman challenged the constitutionality of this proposal, Madison responded it maybe a question of some nicety, how far we can make our law to admit an alien to the right of citizenship step-by-step, but there is no doubt we may and ought to require residence as an essential, and despite appellant's contentions to the contrary in a reply brief, I think a reading by this Court of that entire 10 or 15-page discussion in the first Congress will show that Madison was discussing residence after naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.791" offset="13450533">In the conflict between the Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians in the 1790s over the right of citizens to renounce their citizenship, the Jeffersonians argued that immigration and resulting residence abroad dissolved the ties binding a citizen to his government and when this issue again became crucial during the war of 1812, the Madison administration published a pamphlet saying that immigration with intent to reside abroad permanently ipso facto constituted expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.497" offset="13589400">During the 19th Century a new problem arose in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.226" offset="13608312">Naturalized citizens residing in their native lands became sources of conflict in American foreign relations, when foreign countries treated them as their own citizens with regard to military service, to taxation, to political loyalty and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.298" offset="13680515">As a result despite the traditional American doctrine of extending protection to natural born and naturalized citizens alike, the Department of State as early as 1818 tried to meet this problem by refusing to give protection to naturalized citizens domiciled in their former homelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.135" offset="13763897">After the civil war the problem became even more acute, as pressure began to conscript American citizens into it's armies and England charged American citizens with complicity in the Fenian Revolt after they had returned to their native Ireland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.066" offset="13827636">Consequently the American government tried three new methods to meet this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.262" offset="13848430">First, Congress in 1868 passed a statute which provided that naturalized citizens and native born citizens would be given protection and the like in the hopes that foreign countries could be induced not to make demands on any American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.077" offset="13911646">Also in 1868 the Department of State began to enter into the so called Bancroft Treaties, which provided that if a -- that a naturalize citizen was expatriated, if he returned to his former homeland without an intent to return to his adopted country and that an intent not to return would be presumed after two years residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.710" offset="14014255">Today these Bancroft Treaties are enforced with 21 different nations, not including Germany, although one -- the first treaty was with Germany since at the time the treaty expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.237" offset="14084368">And the third method of dealing with this problem was that late in the 19th Century the Department of State started to inform naturalized citizens residing in their native lands with which no Bancroft Treaty existed that they had expatriated themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.720" offset="14154271">When President Grant pulled his cabinet as to whether naturalized citizens resided in their native countries with no intent to return to this country had expatriated themselves, a majority of the cabinet answered in the affirmative including Secretary of State Fish, and this principle was also followed by several international mixed claims commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.550" offset="14241520">As this Court described the situation in Perez, the historical situation at the end of the 19th Century, no one seems to have questioned the necessity of having the Department of State pass on the validity of claims to American citizenship, but this method was regarded as unsatisfactory since no clear standard existed and expatriation depended on executive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.968" offset="14343293">Consequently demands grew for Congress to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.504" offset="14357400">As early as 1863, President Lincoln suggested to Congress that it fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States residing abroad may claim the interposition of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.218" offset="14412257">In 1874, President Grant told Congress that a statute defining expatriation was necessary because the representatives of the United States in foreign countries are continually called upon to lend their aid in the protection of the United States to persons concerning whose citizenship there is at least a great question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.639" offset="14501909">However, Congress did not act promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.361" offset="14512776">It was not until the start of the 20th century the Congress first passed legislation in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.811" offset="14534614">They first passed in 1906, the statute which Mr. Freedman has alluded to providing for -- providing a presumption of loss, fraudulent naturalization for leaving the country within five years of naturalization, but that same year Congress suggested that a thorough study be made to the entire field of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.751" offset="14630327">As a result, Secretary of State Root appointed three high state department officials to study the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.067" offset="14659688">This Citizenship Board as it was called founded the class of Americans who live within the jurisdiction of foreign countries is becoming larger each year and the question of their protection causes increasing embarrassment to this government in its relations with foreign powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.137" offset="14727920">The Board said the denial of diplomatic protection was not sufficient since they left too much to the uncertainty or fluctuations of executive policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.735" offset="14766268">As a result of the Board's recommendation, Congress passed the Nationality Act 1907 which provided that if a naturalized citizen resided in the foreign state of his origin for two years or any other foreign state for five years that he be presumed to have lost his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.812" offset="14850591">In explaining this provision, the House Committee which reported the bill said, perhaps the most important provision of the bill was desired by the state department, a guard against complications in which this country has become involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.947" offset="14907120">Many foreigners come here become naturalized and then return to their own countries or migrate to other parts of the world without any intention of returning to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.022" offset="14947453">Such a provision as this would be a great assistance to the Department of State, would avoid possibilities of international complications and will prevent those who are not entitled to its protection from dishonestly hiding under the American flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.149" offset="15007953">However, the 1907 statute did not worth well in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.299" offset="15024567">The 1933, President Roosevelt appointed a committee composed of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Labor, and the Attorney General to review all the nationality laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="4774.027" offset="19199457">In Perez, this Court sustained a statute providing for expatriation because of voting in a formal election on the ground that it might embroil the United States and foreign difficulties.</text>

            <text syncTime="4866.854" offset="19570813">In Perez this Court also noted that voting in foreign elections suggested a transfer of allegiance from the United States to a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.347" offset="19604773">Now the Court has said that this was not without significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.822" offset="19618670">It did not say that this was crucial to the decision as the appellant contends, but even if it were crucial to the decision in Perez, even if we assume that, surely prolonged residence in one's former homeland signifies far more clearly a transfer of allegiance, than the brief single act of voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.999" offset="19707382">Therefore, the factor of residence has been considered crucial in determining citizenship by the international court, by text writers on international law as well as by the many foreign countries which I have noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.472" offset="19773210">I think the relevance of a prolonged stay in one's homeland to transfer of allegiance, to dilution of allegiance is well expressed by the cabinet committee appointed by President Roosevelt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.831" offset="19830680">Needless to say naturalized citizens who resume residence in the foreign lands from which they came are apt to renew old associations and ways of living and thinking and thus become merged in the native population, losing to a great degree, if not completely their American character and feeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.915" offset="19907062">This makes it all the more desirable that American nationality and not merely the right to diplomatic protection of this government shall be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.157" offset="19948022">Now turning to the appellant's principle contention, I think the most serious contention in this case, the distinction between naturalized and native born citizens, the appellant relies on statements in Osborn versus The National Bank and other cases by this Court, all which I think are dictum but which I think were seriously considered, where this Court has said that naturalized and native born citizens stand on the same footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.947" offset="20055124">The government has two answers to appellant's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.430" offset="20073096">First, the Constitution itself shows that naturalized citizens have more limited political rights than native born citizens and in addition the statement by Madison upon which I rely before shows that residence was considered so interrelated with naturalization, that it could be made a requirement of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.532" offset="20157524">Therefore, while we believe that the statement in Osborn is generally true, that the Constitution and history demonstrate that it has certain narrow exceptions vitally related to the question of naturalization itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.582" offset="20213739">Now the second reason that we think that appellant errs is that even though all American citizens must be treated equally, Congress of course can make reasonable distinctions between various classes of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.698" offset="20274134">For example, rich citizens and poor citizens stand on the same footing, bankers and workers stand on the same footing, but this does not prevent Congress from making rational distinctions between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.733" offset="20330350">Therefore, we submit that the crucial question in this case is whether the distinction between naturalized and native born citizens was a rational one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.885" offset="20370892">I may say at this point that this is not a question of -- as in the Japanese cases of putting a label on particular people, of saying that some people are better than others, there is no contention, that Mr. Schneider or anybody else was disloyal or treasonable or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.233" offset="20444348">This is a regulation of foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.590" offset="20453752">What we do say is that Mrs. Schneider and other people similarly situated cause serious problems in American foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.439" offset="20497115">Now I have stressed before that it's long been recognized that there is a distinction between native born and naturalized citizens, both in relation to conflict with foreign governments and in relation to the possibility of the transfer of their allegiance to foreign governments.</text>

            <text syncTime="5729.418" offset="23021066">The reason, I suggest that is apparently the states' believe that an alien who lived in this country for a while took on enough American ways so he could be trusted to vote in American elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.577" offset="23061713">We think that an American citizen who lives long enough in a foreign country also assumes enough of the ways of that country so they should no longer be considered an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.667" offset="23110092">I like to point out that Section 352 a (1), if discrimination against naturalized citizens is a very, very limited one in its terms, in terms it applies only to the country of origin of the naturalized citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.383" offset="23176861">Now, there is no country of origin of native born citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5771.674" offset="23190026">Now, passing that question of discrimination in its terms looking to its effect, Section 352 a (1) says that a naturalized citizen cannot live more than three years in one country in the world, the country from which he originally came.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.628" offset="23261915">And it makes broad exceptions from this in Section 353, where Congress felt that the particular problems which I've discussed did not exist and we submit that this is a far smaller discrimination than this Court upheld in Mackenzie and Hare.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.663" offset="23321997">There this Court upheld a statute which suspended citizenship, took it away for a period of time which might be life because an American women married a foreigner while not taking away citizenship from American men who married foreign women.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.345" offset="23412799">I'd like also to point out that Section 352 a (1) has much less effect, the expatriation of people covered by 352 a (1) is far less severe than it would be on native born citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.980" offset="23475284">This provision applies only the persons who returned to their former homelands and reside their for over three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.577" offset="23505690">They are likely to be either dual nationals or as in this case able to reacquire citizenship extremely easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.878" offset="23534843">I mean to say that there is a substantial question whether is not a dual national.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.455" offset="23549158">The main reason Germany describes her as stateless because she wants to be labeled as stateless and in our view under German Law she did not, probably did not lose her citizenship because either she nor her mother ever applied to the government or to a Court in Germany at the time that she acquired American citizenship, but even passing that, that isn't crucial to the case, passing that she can easily reacquire German citizenship, she is not in the situation of a person who is going to be stateless in the real sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.532" offset="23681546">She wants American citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="5962.878" offset="23954892">Now, I would like to emphasize that this Court in Bolling and Sharpe implied that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment does not contain all the content which the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states, but even if it did it bars only unreasonable classifications and I think history establishes beyond any doubt that this classification has been considered reasonable and is still reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.160" offset="24088012">I now like to turn to the particular facts of this case because as I have indicated I think that what is involved here when reduced to its core is whether Congress had the power to provide for the appellant's expatriation in the view of section 406.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.511" offset="24169409">Appellant has made clear that she has no that she has the intention of remaining in Germany indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.546" offset="24197517">Her husband has a law practice there, he apparently is going to stay, she naturally is going to stay with him and that she has no intent of ever residing in the United States except that she expects that she will make visits here as she has made in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.085" offset="24263764">Therefore, her case falls within the Bancroft Treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="6044.868" offset="24282885">It falls within the situations which were governed by the discretion of the Secretary of State at the end of the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.180" offset="24316113">In other words, her situation falls within the narrow core of cases which raise most acutely the foreign affairs problems and the problems of transfer of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.481" offset="24377344">Looking at the other side of the coin, looking at the effect of expatriation on her, assuming that that is relevant, appellant -- all that appellant looses here other than that she wants to have the good feeling that she is an American citizen, she wants American diplomatic protection, she wants to travel to United States without a visa, and at if some unforeseen adversity occurs she wants to be able to come here at will.</text>

            <text syncTime="6470.159" offset="25983979">However, we think the short answer to this is Mcculloch and Maryland.</text>

            <text syncTime="6528.324" offset="26216678">The means may have to do with something in the United States but the purpose and the field being regulated is foreign relations.</text>

            <text syncTime="6553.609" offset="26317824">Therefore Congress finally after years and years of experience by the Department of State turned to the method which is now in the 1952 Act, we think that this was a perfect rationale decision, first because a clear rule is necessary to dissuade other countries from interfering with American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.601" offset="26397759">As a result, American citizens are better protected and foreign conflict is reduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="6854.991" offset="27523323">The fact that they had been together is we are dealing with people who are residing not only in the country of their origin, but in other countries, shows that Congress was not concerned with the nature of foreign affairs problem, but I think I quote Mr. Terris correctly if I say that solicitors of this country, they are concerned with the problem of retransfer of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.378" offset="27616841">In other words, this is a kind of rough attempt by the Congress to find out if American citizens are loyal by lumping them in groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="7027.230" offset="28212328">That is extensively brief Your Honor and we believe that there is no right to condition citizenship and require one class of citizens is something that you do not require of another class of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="7036.959" offset="28251199">That's I think the most basic point we make.</text>
            <text syncTime="7039.694" offset="28262170">Now there are a few little things I would like to pick up as I've noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7043.352" offset="28276799">Now Mr. Terris stated with respect to -- and he pays great attention to the 1906 citizenship board and he says the 1907 statute was a result of the board's recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7054.982" offset="28323297">Now what he omits to state was the board in that case recommended that as far as people living abroad were concerned that you had to deal with born and naturalized citizens on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="7066.198" offset="28368123">I think there's an interesting and more detailed history, more detailed than in any brief that is filed in the Cornell Law Quarterly we have cited in our reply brief but I like specifically to note it, 49 Cornell Law Quarterly Page 52, it's a 1963 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7083.006" offset="28435414">Now as far as the Bankcroft treaties which were mentioned, I think one thing that's consequential, we've mentioned that in our reply brief on page ten, the Bancroft don't deal with taking away citizenship at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7095.209" offset="28484211">They deal with diplomatic protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="7097.685" offset="28494137">It's so stated, there is a decision of the Immigration Naturalization Board, the State Department itself urges it before the International Court of Justice that it had nothing to do with taking away citizenship that people could always come back, it's like the 1907 Statute, it's a question of diplomatic protection.</text>
