            <text syncTime="11.168" offset="148041">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.695" offset="162147">This case is another search and seizure case that comes here on a writ of certiorari to the District Court of Appeal for the Second District of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.132" offset="199868">It involves applicability of the decisions in Mapp versus Ohio and Ker versus California to this particular state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.960" offset="235186">The search and seizure took place in a hotel room that belonged to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.597" offset="265801">The questions stated very generally are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.549" offset="281579">First whether the search and seizure were valid because incident to a valid arrest; second whether the search and seizure are somehow validated by the consent to the search and seizure that were given by the hotel clerk; third whether assuming that the search might have been valid, the seizure was nonetheless invalid because the items that were sized were neither means nor instrumentalities for the commission of crime, nor contraband, nor the fruits of a crime and finally, assuming that the search or the seizure was invalid, the admission into evidence of the items that were seized was mere harmless error and then the further question of course whether if that be so, the conviction should affirmed or reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.796" offset="474572">The facts that bear upon these issues are not particularly complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.396" offset="496933">They may be summarized I think something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.612" offset="513860">The crime of which petitioner was convicted was a crime of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.149" offset="536012">The robbery was of a grocery store in the City of Monrovia, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.029" offset="555447">It took place about 8 o'clock in the evening of October 25, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.321" offset="576658">Two men committed the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.606" offset="581778">There were two eyewitnesses to the crime, employees in the grocery store.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.785" offset="602467">Shortly after the police of Monrovia started their investigation of the crime, the manager of the grocery store turned over to them a check book and a deposit book, a bank deposit book, which were traced to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.811" offset="674565">The check book reveled that two checks had very recently been drawn out to a hotel called Mayfair Hotel in the city of Pomona, California.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="153.205" offset="716152">Where this had this check book and this deposit --</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_dempsey_jr" startTime="155.823" stopTime="602.193">
            <label>Mr. William H. Dempsey, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="155.823" offset="726706">They had been found Mr. Justice Stewart in the parking lot, adjacent to the grocery store.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.866" offset="750843">It's not clear whether it was the grocery store's parking lot, but in any event a parking lot adjacent to the grocery store and shortly -- they have been found shortly after the crime. That's about as clear the record is on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.757" offset="798386">The Monrovia police contacted the Pomona police.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.169" offset="816044">They got a mug shot of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.351" offset="824822">They found that he had a prior record.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.530" offset="833494">He had been convicted a murder and robbery before.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.659" offset="846033">They showed the mug shot to the two eyewitnesses, who said that this looked like one of the man who had committed the crime, but they wanted to see him in person.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.470" offset="881246">So the Monrovia police went to Pomona, two days after the crime on the evening of October 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.082" offset="911653">They conferred with the Pomona police for a while and then about 11 o'clock on the evening of October 27, two members of the Pomona force and two members of the Monrovia force went to the Mayfair Hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.890" offset="978944">Now what happened then is critically important in this case and so I will take the liberty of reading the pertinent extracts verbatim from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.072" offset="1015620">This is one of the officers testifying at the trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.265" offset="1032443">He said -- this is on -- excuse me Mr. Justice, this is one page -- beginning on the bottom of page 71, about two-thirds of the way down that page, and I'm going to skip some of the intervening material, I'm not going to read the whole thing, I'm just picking out portions of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.634" offset="1097958">And I'm starting at about two-thirds down toward the end of the line where there is a long answer, right at the end the line it starts, we approached the desk, the night clerk and asked him if there was party by the name of the Joey L. Stoner living at the hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.911" offset="1158980">He checked his records and stated, yes, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.873" offset="1170892">And we asked him what room he was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.789" offset="1178520">He stated he was in Room 404, but he was out at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.448" offset="1193148">We asked him how he knew that he was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.681" offset="1202134">He stated that the hotel regulations required that the key to the room would be placed in the mail box each time they left the hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.883" offset="1230869">The key was in the mail box, that he therefore knew he was out of the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.717" offset="1246229">We asked him if he would give us permission to enter the room, explaining our reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.520" offset="1261484">Question - what reasons did you explain to the clerk?</text>
            <text syncTime="292.267" offset="1272456">Answer - we explained that we were there to make an arrest of a man who had possibly committed a robbery in the City of Monrovia, and that we were concerned about the fact that he had a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.296" offset="1312580">He stated, in this case, I will be more than happy to give you permission and I will take you directly to the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.620" offset="1341837">Then moving on down, we left one detective in the lobby, and Detective Oliver, Officer Collins, and myself, along with the night clerk, got on the elevator and proceeded to the fourth floor, and went to Room 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.135" offset="1387917">The night clerk placed a key in the lock, unlocked the door, and says, be my guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.756" offset="1410382">What did you do, question?</text>
            <text syncTime="327.923" offset="1415084">Answer - we entered the room and the first thing that was observed was pair of horn-rimmed glasses lying on a desk in the northeast corner of the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.573" offset="1445700">I picked the glasses up and looked at them and noted that they answered the description of the glasses described by one of the victims and then he identifies people's exhibit number three as the glasses, and then continuing down at the bottom of page, then what else did you do, question?</text>
            <text syncTime="349.763" offset="1502438">Answer - then begin a systematic search of the room and noted that certain clothing in the room was along the same description as given by the victim or the victims and during the check of the bureau, Officer Collins pulled the drawers from the bureau to check them.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.333" offset="1564714">The bottom drawer when he pulled it completely out we observed a gun lying on the floor, which is the gun which is now that's -- and he identifies it as people's exhibit number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.285" offset="1612466">And the along side of this gun was some toilet paper, white toilet paper, which we unwrapped and it showed a number of cartridges for a 45 automatic and then he identifies that as one of the people's exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.092" offset="1663770">And then down further on about two-thirds of the way down the page, question - was there anything else discovered in the room?</text>
            <text syncTime="395.995" offset="1687385">Answer - there were certain address books and other miscellaneous evidence that was obtained, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.273" offset="1712462">Then he identifies the clip as one of people's exhibits and then over on page 74 he testifies that, another one the people's exhibits, a coat was also recovered from the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.139" offset="1775888">Then he concludes, well at this time we determine that this would be the suspect in our particular robbery and we maintained an observation of the room or in the room, my partner and myself until approximately noon the following day which was the 28th of October.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.152" offset="1847986">Then on noon of the following day, that is about 12 or 13 hours after the search and seizure, the police left the room because the petitioner had not returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.348" offset="1892812">The petitioner was apprehended noon the next day, that is noon on October 29, about 37 hours after the search and seizure and in a different state in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, apparently by the Las Vegas authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.004" offset="1959372">The Pomona police went to Las Vegas. They brought the petitioner back and three days roughly after the arrest and before he had been brought before a magistrate for preliminary hearing, before he had seen any attorneys, or any friends, or any relatives; he confessed to one of the detectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.687" offset="2038157">Now I should note at this point that the question of the voluntariness of that confess is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.099" offset="2059786">It was expressly excluded in this Court's order granting the writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.030" offset="2087476">This brings us then to the trial and when I describe what happen at trial I would like at the same time to deal with the question of so called harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.683" offset="2134079">We submit that there is nothing to this question in this case and therefore the Court need not reach the question left open in Fahy versus Connecticut, whether in any event, even assuming that the error was only harmless the conviction should be affirmed or reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.421" offset="2185070">Now we deal with that further question in our brief, but we don't add anything particularly to the discussion on the Fahy versus Connecticut case.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.253" offset="2220387">The prosecution at the trial relied primarily upon the testimony of the two eyewitnesses to the crime who identified petitioner as one of the robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.930" offset="2263124">The testimony of the alleged accomplice who had turned state's evidence and who had plead guilty and was sentenced, and the testimony of the police officer who testified with respect to the confession and the search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.099" offset="2319757">The defense on the other hand relied primarily upon the testimony of two men or one woman and one man, who said that the petitioner had been with them at the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.741" offset="2370330">They also of course attempted to attack the credibility of the alleged accomplice on the theory that he had -- he was testifying in exchange for the light sentence which he had admittedly got, and they tried to shake the identification testimony of the eyewitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.293" offset="2424560">So that basically the conviction turned upon a resolution of the problem of credibility by the jury and in attempting to shore up the credibility of the eyewitnesses, the state relied very heavily upon these articles that had been seized from the room; that is the gun, the coat and the eye glasses.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Dempsey, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="614.329" offset="2560711">My opponent is helping me.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.905" offset="2566980">He tells me that they were admitted on page 75 of the record and he is quite accurate in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.262" offset="2612433">The, what the prosecutor did was to, was to show the gun and the glasses and the jacket to the eyewitnesses and asked them whether this appeared to be the gun that the petitioner had used or that the robber had used and -- the gun and the eye glasses and the jacket that he had worn at the time of the crime and they said, yes they appear to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.127" offset="2707832">The -- Shails, that is the alleged accomplice testified to the same effect except I -- my collection is that he testified that the jacket was in fact was not the jacket that the petitioner had been wearing, he did identify the gun however and the police then testified as to the circumstances of the search and the fact these items have been obtained from petitioner's room.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.802" offset="2802604">Now as I understand the test under Fahy, it is simply whether there is a reasonable possibility that the introduction of this evidence, these items into evidence contribute, it may have contributed to the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.272" offset="2856417">And in these circumstances we submit that there can't be any genuine doubt that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.781" offset="2874493">The state suggests, as I understand it, first that there was a plenty of evidence otherwise but we think that that's been squarely put aside in the Fahy case, that kind of a test and they suggest secondly that the prosecutor could have used items which were like these items but not really the genuine article that is sort of mock-ups and put the same questions to the witnesses but that misses the whole point.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.421" offset="2969057">The impact of this evidence lay in the fact that as the police testified it had been taken petitioner's hotel room thereby the state was able to link the petitioner with the crime by objective evidence that had been seized from that hotel room.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.016" offset="3027466">Now that's our argument with respect to the question of harmless error in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.328" offset="3048678">I turn then to very briefly I think unless the court wishes me to pursue it to the question of search incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.704" offset="3074173">Now this was the ground upon which the lower court based its decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="747.699" stopTime="749.319">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="747.699" offset="3094131">Well that's no longer an issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_dempsey_jr" startTime="749.319" stopTime="819.461">
            <label>Mr. William H. Dempsey, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="749.319" offset="3100609">Well I, if I am, if I am free to rely entirely upon the concession of the state it certainly isn't and of course it's open to the court to decide, but the state now does concede and they didn't argue in the court below that the search was incident to arrest, it was 37 hours after the arrest and in a different state.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.534" offset="3181484">This brings me then to what I take to be the principle argument of the state and it turns upon the consent to the search that was given by the hotel clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.894" offset="3234983">Now petitioner of course didn't consent, there isn't any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.349" offset="3248776">The room clerk said, be my guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.211" offset="3264240">I observe at the outset what I take to be obvious and that is that if the state's argument is accepted, it has the most far reaching implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.245" offset="3304364">Now there are two branches to the argument; the first is that the room clerk as a matter of state law had actual authority to consent to the search and the second branch is that, assuming arguendo he didn't have actual authority, he had apparent authority and therefore it was reasonable for the police to rely upon this consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.857" offset="3882820">Now what the court, what the court said in Jeffers, in circumstances that seem to me to be entirely indistinguishable from those here was that as you pointed out, guests in hotels have impliedly consented to entry by the hotel to service, to repair, and I suppose that the court might have gone further in Jeffers and said that if there is a, if there is a ruckus going on in the room it maybe that the hotel management has the right to come in and make people be quite.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.722" offset="4014268">But the court held in Jeffers that that kind of implicit consent that arises out of the nature of the contract between the guest and the hotel management does not extend to authorizing the management to consent to a search and seizure without a warrant by the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.431" offset="4137148">He is simply the, the person in the hotel establishment that can take whatever action the management can take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.516" offset="4161390">And what I am suggesting is that in a circumstance of a fight or something like that where peace is being disturbed, it's a hotel detective that exercises the right to go into the room and make them be quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.047" offset="4207574">So that I don't think that the fact that they have someone on their staff who is labeled house detective carries us any further than we would be otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.387" offset="4248952">The Jeffers case I suggest is controlling here at least in the absence of some unusual state law doctrine and what we are dealing with after all is a, at least as I view it is a question of wavier of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.142" offset="4327946">Now I don't say that yes that hotels can't waiver their constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.295" offset="4344560">If a hotel wishes to retain to itself this kind of authority I assume they can put it in a contract that you sign when you come in, or they might put a sign on the -- along side the desk when you register saying that this hotel reserves this kind of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.916" offset="4403075">They might not get as much business as they otherwise did and presumably that's why they don't do it, or one of the reasons, but that isn't this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.847" offset="4434735">You have to in some way imply consent in circumstances that are not distinguishable from Jeffers and I would add are not distinguishable from Lustig either, although the question was not, was not discussed at any length in Lustig, but certainly the holding of Lustig is that a hotel clerk does not have this kind of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.748" offset="4526373">I turn then to, to what is asserted to be a state law which might overcome the barrier that the state faces in view of Lustig and Jeffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.806" offset="4578617">Now this state law, we have examined the cases carefully that the state cites, this state law doesn't bear in any respect it seems to us upon the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.418" offset="4625011">Not only are the decisions that the state cites, not search and seizure cases, but they don't even go in any respect to the right of hotel management to enter a room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.300" offset="4672554">They deal with the relatively esoteric questions or maybe that's the wrong word, but certainly unrelated questions such as whether hotel management has a right to keep a guest's bags when he leaves without paying his bill, whether they have the right to bring an unlawful detainer action to get him out of the room if he doesn't pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.257" offset="4756355">Now these are the kind of state doctrines that the state relies upon here, and we respectfully submit that they simply don't meet the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.169" offset="4804002">Rather these are, these are the kind of local law doctrines that were involved in a case like Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.460" offset="4833259">Well, they don't even go as far as Chapman, but in Chapman the court will recall the landlord, the landlord went to the lease premises on a Sunday morning wanting to invite people to go to church, he had known them before, he smelled mash, he thought that there was a distillery operating which indeed there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.066" offset="4915597">The local police came, and he said, well if it's what I think it is, you have my authority to go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.580" offset="4941720">The police went in through a window there was still operating, they seized and this Court struck down the conviction on the ground that the search and seizure had been unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.455" offset="4985187">Now in this Court, the government relied in part upon an asserted local law or common law doctrine that gives a landlord the right to enter premises to view waste and one of the responses that this Court made to that argument was that this kind of local law that's rooted in the property law differences as respects the rights of guests and licensees and invitees the kind of distinction that the court had put aside in the Jones case in dealing with problem of standards simply could not be relied upon in order to justify what would otherwise be an unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.264" offset="5160417">Now in the case at bar, we don't even have to deal with a situation as troublesome, if it was troublesome, as the court did in Chapman because at least in Chapman, the local law doctrine that was relied upon had to do with the rights of the property, the person who had interest in the property to enter to premises and here the local law doctrines don't even bear upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.125" offset="5263862">And I should add that the one case that seems to us to be clearly in point in the various cases cited by the state is the one called People versus Burke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.727" offset="5318301">Now there the question was whether a hotel clerk had or a hotel management had apparent authority to consent to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.692" offset="5354141">The Court held that it -- that hotel management did not have that kind of authority and certainly implicit in this holding was the holding that they didn't have actual authority because this is the further problem if there is no actual authority then you go to the question of whether there's apparent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.602" offset="5417775">So that the one case it seems to us to be clearly in point negates the kind of local law doctrine that's contended before by the state here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.063" offset="6407607">(Inaudible) state property law was of that kind.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Dempsey, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1583.302" offset="6436551">Not in Jeffers or Lustig Mr. Justice Black it was raised in Chapman of course in the context of a tenant landlord rather than hotel guest, but the argument that I make would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.394" offset="6484929">And I think it is worthwhile noting in the connection Mr. Justice Stewart with respect to the so called apparent authority doctrine that in Chapman, Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his concurring opinion raised this argument, not in, not calling it apparent authority, but speaking in terms of the reasonableness of the action of the police officers and rejected it, so that in that case the matter was squarely put.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.858" offset="6570820">Now I have got a few minutes I would like to touch just briefly on this question of the character of the items that are -- that were seized here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.276" offset="6604466">It's our position that assuming for the moment that the search was valid but the seizure was invalid because in no circumstances could the glasses or the jacket be considered means or instrumentalities of committing a crime or fruits of the crime at least absent some question of disguise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.249" offset="6680325">Now I think the state maybe intimating that there is a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.503" offset="6697357">I have not cited in my brief but I would like to cite now references to page 24 of the transcript in which one of the witnesses said that there was nothing unusual about the hat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.965" offset="6755244">And page 20 -- page 30 of the transcript in which the witness said that there was nothing unique about the horn-rimmed glasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.547" offset="6797563">Now the hat is not in question I don't want to misstate -- overstate my case here, but -- and there is no suggestion that there is anything about the jacket that could have been a disguise and I suggest that there is nothing about the glasses or the hat and no indication that there is any about the jacket, there wasn't any disguise question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.197" offset="6872168">And in those circumstances I say that this, these items simply don't meet the test of the Boyd case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.509" offset="6893380">Now, the state says well even so the Boyd rule is one only of evidence and not a constitutional law upon that we rely on the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.174" offset="6940087">We think that the Boyd is quite claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.317" offset="6948655">This is an important ingredient of Fourth Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.533" offset="6961507">It's always been regarded that way, we think by the Court as late as the Able case and if the state thinks that there could be a better rule, we suggest that foreclosed to that, and we suggest that under the rule of Ker versus California, this doctrine as an important ingredient of Fourth Amendment law is to be applied to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.109" offset="7067773">The question of means of instrumentalities and contraband does have a policy basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.781" offset="7106539">It's spelled out in the Boyd case I suppose with the most clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.485" offset="7125347">It is the policy of the fifth amendment as it sheds light on what's reasonable in terms of the Fourth Amendment provisions yet the state normally doesn't have a right to take your property away from you and the Boyd case said that -- and it has been repeated in cases since then that normally taking a man's property from him and using it in evidence against him is tantamount to forcing him to testify against himself so that there must be something over and above this kind of interest that gives the state the right to seize the items in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.790" offset="7270484">Now historically contraband means instrumentalities of committing a crime fruits of a crime all of these were subject to seizure not because they would then be used against a man, but simply because the man had no possessory right in these particular items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.982" offset="7343313">And in consequence that's the policy basis the state as I say may disagree with it, but it -- we submit that it's a substantial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.941" offset="7375182">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arlo E. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="1825.990" offset="7407365">Your Honors, facts -- pardon me, the facts of this case are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.869" offset="7442892">However, the application of those facts to the law and the effect of that law upon our federal system is very complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.418" offset="7493047">There are three questions presented here; first, whether or not the search of this hotel room was reasonable; secondly, whether or not the items seized in that search come within the prohibition of the so called means and instrumentalities rule; and finally, whether or not if the search were improper, the seizure were improper, the introduction of that evidence into the case resulted in error, whether or not that error was prejudicial, whether or not the states to the Fourteenth Amendment should be bound not only to exclude unreasonably obtained evidence, but to automatically reverse every case in which such an error occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.616" offset="7761795">The search here was conducted of a hotel room in Pomona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.112" offset="7779871">The defendant was then in Las Vegas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.748" offset="7794395">He was arrested two days later in Las Vegas, approximately 200 miles away from the hotel room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.943" offset="7827101">We do not hear nor did we below argue that this search can be justified as an incident to the arrest of Stoner in Las Vegas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.582" offset="7873703">We contend here, as we urged below, that the officers entered that room with a proper consent of the management, that they entered believing in good faith that the manager had the right to give them that consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.406" offset="7972968">California law on this question, we feel, is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.991" offset="7995329">Counsel for petitioner seems to feel that it is quite unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.658" offset="8018004">We have cited to you general cases safe -- referring to the authority of an innkeeper over the -- all of the premises, including the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.409" offset="8061053">This apparently is not uncommon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.440" offset="8073174">Last Sunday while reviewing this case without announcing himself a member of the -- an employee came upon me; luckily I was properly attired to meet both guests and agents of the innkeeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.176" offset="8148093">This is a matter of implied contract, implied understanding between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.120" offset="8203891">We feel that the California law is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.330" offset="8216743">We have cited to you the case of People versus Ambrose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.730" offset="8234297">We think it covers the application of these rules in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.065" offset="8259584">Petitioner's counsel suggests to you that this is inconsistent with another California case, the case of People versus Burke, which we cited to you also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.446" offset="8309112">The Burke case, however, is -- goes off in an entirely different point the holding of that case is that the search of the hotel room was proper because the officers had reasonable and probable cause to arrest the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.382" offset="8368880">They held that it was inconsequential if the officers had entered the room on prior occasions because it had no bearing upon their reasonable and probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.237" offset="8412348">That there was independent ground for the officers to believe that there was probable cause, the language of Burke is pure dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.748" offset="8454353">Not only is it dictum, it has no application to the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.476" offset="8473266">It relies on another California Supreme Court case, case of People versus Roberts, which evolves an apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.584" offset="8505657">Now let me quote to you from the California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.797" offset="8518510">In Roberts, the California Supreme Court points out that the manager testified that she had neither authority nor permission for Mrs. Higgins to enter her apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.705" offset="8582144">There was no claim that the manger had authority to enter the Roberts apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.294" offset="8608580">Likewise in Burke itself the court points out that mere fact that a hotel manager does not import an authority to permit the police to enter and search -- does not import an authority to permit the police to enter and search the rooms of her guests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.793" offset="8678588">Therefore, proof that the police were let in by the manager without law cannot satisfy the burden upon the prosecution to show that the officers reasonably believed in good faith that they had the consent of an authorized person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.013" offset="8755388">That question Your Honors is not really before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.590" offset="8777749">The law of Burke in no way detracts from the position we take here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.251" offset="8800423">We feel California law is quite clear that the facts establish that the hotel or innkeeper had authority or if the facts establish that the officers in good faith and upon good reason believed that the hotel keeper had such authority, then the search is proper.</text>
