            <text syncTime="55.531" offset="325465">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.544" offset="349497">The issue in this case which is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is the validity under the Constitution under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, of the action of the Fifth Circuit in granting the motion of the government to dismiss the appeal on the ground that no notice of appeal had been received by the District Court within 10 days after petitioner's sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.585" offset="497664">Petitioner was convicted on three counts arising out of a post office robbery, upon a trial in which he was represented by court appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.109" offset="543848">On January 15, 1962, petitioner was sentenced to consecutive terms aggregating 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.757" offset="582405">The court appointed counsel was physically present at the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.179" offset="612080">The record of the sentencing shows that petitioner himself asked the Court “May I appeal this case as an insolvent?”</text>
            <text syncTime="135.192" offset="644159">The District Court replied, “Oh yes, you always have a right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.312" offset="672580">The government provides for that.” Thereupon the sentencing proceeding was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.100" offset="707793">After the sentencing, petitioner and his court appointed counsel had a talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.781" offset="726497">The record before this Court contains letters from both the counsel and the petitioner relating to this conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.966" offset="767248">The counsel's letter contains the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.731" offset="782294">At that time I told Mr. Fallen that the firm with which I am associated, did not wish me to undertake any further criminal matters either by appeal or otherwise and therefore I suggested that Mr. Fallen secure another attorney without delay so as not to forfeit his right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.334" offset="868707">Counsel then departed out of the case so far as he was concerned at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.518" offset="913429">He did not notify the Court Your Honor that he was withdrawing so far as this record was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.901" offset="938924">In fact Your Honor he was reappointed under the circumstances, I'll come to shortly, which indicates very clearly that the court recognized the propriety, evidently under the terms of its original appointment of his disassociating himself from petitioner at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.892" offset="1026905">There is no indication that there was any other communication with the District Court after this conversation by the counsel until he was reappointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.766" offset="1074448">On January 29, the fourteenth day subsequent to petitioner's sentencing, the District Court received two letters, each dated January 23, written by petitioner, the one constituting a motion for a new trial and the other a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.920" offset="1151039">These then were the first papers received by the District Court subsequent to the sentencing, so that prior to January 29 and between January 15 and January 29, there was no communication with the District Court by the petitioner or by his court appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.687" offset="1238079">Petitioner had been incarcerated during the trial in Jacksonville, Florida where the trial took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.238" offset="1276322">The day following his sentencing, he was removed to the hospital at the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta and it was from the Federal penitentiary that the letters were transmitted to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.933" offset="1335150">On January 30, the day after the letters were received, pursuant to a request from the District Court, the court appointed counsel sent a letter to the court, summarizing the facts to which I have already referred.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.814" offset="1434624">Yes, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.921" offset="1439013">The fact that he had told petitioner that he and petitioner had had a conversation subsequent to the sentencing, that he had told petitioner that his firm did not permit him or would not permit him to undertake any further criminal matters and that petitioner ought to do something else about getting another attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.984" offset="1539323">On February 1, the District Court filed an order which expressly reappointed this court appointed counsel as counsel for the limited purpose of presenting the question whether petitioner's motion for a new trial was timely filed, and if so whether it should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.797" offset="1626572">The District Court found, in this order, that while appeal was discussed on January 15 with Mr. Fallen, the provisions of the rules with respect to new trial were not discussed with him, nor the requirements of law with respect to appeal in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.847" offset="1726777">The District Court found that the representation of petitioner by court appointed counsel had ended on the date of the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.185" offset="1784142">Under these circumstances, it is undoubtedly an undeniably the fact that this court appointed counsel took no action and felt himself under no assignment or responsibility to the petitioner with respect to either the motion for new trial or the notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.145" offset="1891976">This counsel does not claim that he advised petitioner as to the time limits, specified in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.880" offset="1926875">Nor does he claim that he provided petitioner with any assistance whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.060" offset="1955610">The record before the Court is sufficiently complete to be absolutely clear and unquestionable that this court appointed counsel did not represent petitioner and did not afford him the assistance of counsel at any time during the 10-day period subsequent to the sentencing or at any time prior to his being reappointed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.061" offset="2067623">On February 21, the District Court denied the motion for a new trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.607" offset="2089775">It expressly did not decide the issue of timeliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.590" offset="2105762">On the same day, the court appointed counsel filed the formal notice of appeal and the requisite papers for appeal as an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.025" offset="2147453">On February 26, such an appeal was allowed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.520" offset="2173471">In the Court of Appeals, after the government had filed its motion to dismiss, another counsel was appointed to represent petitioner for the purpose of the government's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.736" offset="2222268">The Court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal by a two to one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.078" offset="2247659">The majority found that the petitioner had raised no constitutional issues, but Judge Reese, in dissent, called attention to the fact that the defendant did not have counsel of his own choice or court appointed counsel throughout the 10-day period allowed for filing his notice of appeal, that he was not adequately advised of his rights, was recognized by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.352" offset="2380779">Upon these facts, petitioner's first contention here is that the Court of Appeals' judgment cannot stand because it is in violation of petitioner's right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.135" offset="2435950">This appeal was dismissed on the basis of papers filed by petitioner himself without the assistance of counsel during the time when he had no court appointed counsel and when he had not waved, in any way, his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.315" offset="2512645">Here we are dealing with the Federal system where as this Court had pointed out in Hardy against the United States, the appeal is a matter of right and where the appellant is entitled to the aid of counsel unless he insists on being his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.398" offset="2605014">The cases of this Court in our view, leaves no room for doubt that the right to counsel under the Constitution as well as the Federal statues and rules extends to trails on the one hand and to appeals on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.523" offset="2693413">A Court may not constitutionally convict if the defendant has been deprived of his right to counsel at the trial and appellate court may not constitutionally affirm if the appellant has been deprived of his right to counsel on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.451" offset="2761226">It clearly follows that an appellate court may not dismiss the appeal if the appellant has been deprived of right to counsel in the submission of the appeal papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.381" offset="2820890">This case itself is a most eloquent illustration and demonstration of the consequences of failing to accord the right of counsel, during the period immediately after the sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.573" offset="7813622">We have suggested in our brief that there are four rules that state the time within which a prisoner must act and the actions he must take to file a timely appeal within Rule 37 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.480" offset="7885302">Only one of these do we believe could be decided on the record that was before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.409" offset="7909021">That construction of Rule 37 (a) is the one adopted by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.548" offset="7929605">It said the notice of appeal must arrive in being the clerk's constructive or actual possession within 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.883" offset="7962937">Now, that is an entirely reasonable construction we believe in the case of everyone except prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.040" offset="7991568">The rule itself says an appeal was taken by Fallen in notice with the clerk and shall be taken within 10 days that seems to mean that the notice shall be filed within 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.887" offset="8038902">This is the general rule for civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.548" offset="8049560">It's also a rule that gives maximum of certainty and that maybe the most important characteristic of a rule for appeals so that everyone would know when the criminal prosecution is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.449" offset="8089161">We did not defend that judgment in our memorandum on the cert petition and we don't defend it now for the reason that was simply stated by Judge Shawn in a case for himself in the two Judge hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.697" offset="8146108">The prisoner's right to appeal cannot be left in the hands of his jailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.642" offset="8169932">It's one thing to say to an ordinary defendant who is out of bail or who has counsel that he has an absolute obligation of getting his notice of appeal to the Court within 10 days, all he has to do is write a letter and say I want to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.631" offset="8237850">He has that power and having the power, it can be required of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.626" offset="8253837">The Robinson case that neglect in taking his action is not excusable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.618" offset="8277870">It's an entirely different thing to say that to a prisoner who is a penitentiary behind bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.340" offset="8300753">He has no power to get his notice for appeal to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.449" offset="8313187">He is required to use a courier and he can't choose his courier, his only courier is his jailer, the government which succeeded in obtaining the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.768" offset="8354461">For that reason we think that timeliness of appeal for a prisoner must be decided by when he takes an action within his power that is when he gives the notice for appeal to the prison authorities for forwarding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.206" offset="8408168">Now, that's the very when, that's the very when that we don't think was before the Court of Appeals in this case, and that's the reason why we believe a remand is necessary and a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.635" offset="11901889">The government believes that if felon is telling the truth his notice of appeal is timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.039" offset="11931564">Even a felon is not telling the truth, whatever loss may have come to him from and absence of counsel which, which does not appear, we don't know what counsel said to him, we would have that remand on that, for whatever loss may have come to him from the absence of counsel would be, we believe made up by the Fifth Circuit's later decision in Flora which says the 10-day rule doesn't begin to run, until the prisoner is informed by Court or counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.344" offset="12048697">So Fallen is protected, coming and going on the counsel point, on the timeliness of this appeal on the counsel point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.257" offset="12080358">As to future cases, we believe that the pending revision of the rules is a far superior place to go into this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.543" offset="12113586">It's been going into in-depth now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.014" offset="12127378">I wanted to mention three rules I think I have mentioned two of them, one is that the District Court would be (Inaudible) proposals, one is the District Court would be required to inform every defendant of his right to appeal and to ask every defendant if the clerk were to make available to every defendant the services of the clerk in noting the appeal immediately, another is the provision for 30 days for excusable neglect, and third is a proposed revision of the rules for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.607" offset="12269798">The new rules would make clear that counsel stayed with them all the time through I think. There are two bills now before Congress that are in conference that would make that clear, and these are the places for disclosing of a counsel issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Isaac N. Groner</label>
            <text syncTime="3157.170" offset="12732061">Just so the formalities maybe tidied up and however naked my motivation may now be, certainly petitioner would stipulate to the facts which have been added here by the representative of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.612" offset="12801860">We would stipulate that they ought to be and shall be considered part of the record before the Court and of course we would agree with the conclusion which of course we agreed with before that there now can be no doubt whatsoever that on the eighth day, this petitioner did deposit in the mail this notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.998" offset="12919411">And so on the first ground we think now it conceded on the first ground in terms of what we argued in our brief, it is now conceded that for the purposes of this case it maybe stipulated that he deposited on the eighth day, we believe therefore that on that ground the Court should hold that he has done all that he can do and therefore should reverse the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.792" offset="13018572">On the right to counsel point, however we do believe that there are or might be some utility in the Court discussing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.214" offset="13052217">We do not believe that there is any need for remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.465" offset="13065279">It is absolutely clear whatever was said between them that the counsel did not act on behalf of the petitioner and the petitioner has not waved his right to counsel and we would therefore say that the right to counsel has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.457" offset="13133197">The notes to the new rules use the same phrase at all stages that Rule 44 does and so we would say it is the present rules that we are concerned with, and rules 44 guarantee that there would be in fact available the assistance of counsel at all stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.624" offset="13213863">And we certainly would join the government in commending to Your Honors the case of Boroff against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.661" offset="13250017">Now, we certainly would agree that the reasoning of that case is a persuasive guide to the principles which ought to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.686" offset="13286066">Now, there is one further point because there were questions asked by Justices Goldberg and White at least with respect to the duty of the Judge except that the answers or the discussion seems to be the context of the duty of the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.195" offset="13372165">Our position is that it's a duty devolves upon the Judge and if the Judge was put on notice here that the petitioner wanted to appeal, Rule 37 (a) (2) as it now stand says, that when a Court after trial imposes sentence upon a defendant not represented by counsel the defendant shall be advised of his right to appeal and if he so requests the clerk shall prepare and file forth with a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.876" offset="13494836">We say that that imposes an obligation upon the Court and that that obligation was not satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.575" offset="13529631">We don't construe that rule as bearing upon the authorization of the clerk as the government does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.246" offset="13556381">We think it bears upon the obligation of the Court and the Court obviously did not satisfy it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.116" offset="13583862">For those reasons and for the reasons that the rules ought generally to be interpreted so as to do justice, we would strongly urge the Court that the judgment below be reversed and that the case be remanded not for any further hearing whatsoever, but with directions to reinstate the appeal and to decide the appeal on it's merits.</text>
