            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 100, Dion Tyrone Diamond, Petitioner, versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.628" offset="157863">Mr. Nabrit.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. James M. Nabrit, III</label>
            <text syncTime="14.928" offset="163088">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.296" offset="176567">This case is before the Court on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, brought by the petitioner, Dion Diamond, who was convicted of the crime of disturbing the peace in violation of Louisiana Revised Statute 14:103 and was sentenced to jail and to pay a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.787" offset="262562">Petitioner contends generally and has throughout the proceedings that his Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by his conviction for making a series of speeches under a vague and indefinite criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.745" offset="318360">Now, the statute involved is setout on the second page of petitioner's brief, it is that may be remembered as the law which was before this Court in Garner against Louisiana two years or three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.279" offset="388472">The Part A of the statute with -- which we're concerned, contains seven subsections prohibiting a number of different acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.788" offset="434552">The -- for example, the first describes as engaging -- as disturbing the peace, engaging in a fistic encounter, the second relates to unnecessary -- unnecessarily loud, offensive or insulting language.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.323" offset="496619">The third, appearing in an intoxicated condition, the fourth, engaging in any act in a violent and tumultuous manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.851" offset="530787">And now we come to the last three sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.570" offset="549700">Section 5, holding of an unlawful assembly, 6, interruption of any lawful assembly of people and 7, relate -- the catch or clause relates to the Commission of any other act in such a manner as to unreasonably disturb or alarm the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.989" offset="623365">Now, the parties are in dispute in this case as to which part of this law was used to convict the petitioner and indeed, the State has shifted its ground in successive briefs filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.129" offset="703927">The State now contends that subsections 5 and 6 were the ones used to convict the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.730" offset="734333">In the brief in opposition to certiorari, they argued only that subsection 6 was in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.667" offset="758053">Now before -- but -- but before describing the facts in the proceedings, I'd like to briefly state just -- just state without argument, the principal arguments that we will make.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.160" offset="807999">First, we contend that this case is like Stromberg against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.382" offset="832867">And that, there is no way to exclude the possibility that the trial judge relied upon the most sweeping and general and indefinite part of the statute, subsection 7 to convict the petition and that this provision is unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.412" offset="905070">And secondly, we urge that in another aspect, for cases like Thomas against Collins because whatever part of the law, it was used to convict Diamond, he was convicted and given a single penalty for making a number of speeches and saying a number of different things including the charge that he encouraged a group of college students to stay away from classes.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.505" offset="1037354">And they took -- finished that second thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.039" offset="1051564">There -- no part of the statute is sufficiently precise and definite to punish this type of -- this particular type of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.190" offset="1088136">And the applical -- applicable principle of Thomas against Collins being that as for a single conviction rest on more than one State and one of the statesmen cannot validly be punished here for want a fair warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.961" offset="1143202">The entire conviction must be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.972" offset="1195238">I'm going to attempt right now to describe the -- the evidence which concerned a series of speeches made by Diamond on the campus of Southern University near -- in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.148" offset="1259917">The time of his first speech, which was on January 20th or 30th of 1962, some of the Southern University students had been engaged on a boycott of classes for several days and their protest related to the school's treatment of some students who had been arrested in anti-segregation demonstration.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.531" offset="1581537">On this -- on this morning, Diamond was seen at about 9:30 in the morning by the dean of students, speaking to a group of students in a quadrangle outdoors in the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.686" offset="1638066">The dean listened to Diamond's speech for 10 or 15 minutes and his testimony is the only description of this first speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.839" offset="1666696">He -- he said only that Diamond was talking about the importance of demonstrating and staying out quest, it's a quote, that's the only description of the first speech on the morning of the 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.977" offset="1719254">The meeting lasted -- the speech lasted about 15 minutes and the students then dispersed on about their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.792" offset="1746526">The second speech occurred the next morning on the 31st, I might interject at this point that the information charges that Diamond committed this crime on the two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.819" offset="1802637">On the second morning, and again about the same time and place, Diamond was again seen by the dean, speaking to a group of several hundred students on the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.544" offset="1853524">And he's -- and the dean's only description of the second speech was that it was pretty much the same as that of the previous day.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.262" offset="1888423">The speech was also heard by a man named, (Inaudible), it was the campus guard or security guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.882" offset="1918934">And he -- he said that Diamond told the students listening to him not to go classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.948" offset="1947146">The faculty had signed some sort of a petition to supporting them and that they should show their gratitude by staying out of classes during this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.702" offset="1982151">Again, the meeting lasted about 15 to 20 minutes, that's all it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.145" offset="1999914">Now, the Dean said that he didn't authorize Diamond to make these speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.107" offset="2019767">And for listening to him for 15 to 20 minutes, he started toward him to tell him, he didn't have permission, but then the meeting broke up so he never talked.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.469" offset="2053204">Now, the third speech occurred during the noon hour of the second day.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.485" offset="2077341">And the estimates of the number of students listening -- there varied from 200 to 600 and three witnesses testified about this third speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.121" offset="2131884">Again, with respect to the third speech, the dean who heard it said it -- "It concerned principally the boycotting of classes."</text>
            <text syncTime="515.217" offset="2164276">That's the only description of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.979" offset="2171277">However, the two campus security guards gave and said more.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.282" offset="2192488">They said that -- Officer (Inaudible) that he heard Diamond tell the students, we will go through the classrooms and if necessary, we will put them out of their classrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.631" offset="2237942">And his assistant Harris said he heard Diamond urging the students to say -- stay out of classes and to say, "Let's go through the classrooms and to go from classroom to classroom."</text>

            <text syncTime="757.509" offset="3133419">Now, about 6:00 that evening, there was an official meeting of the Student Government Organization where the Dean spoke and the President of the student body spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.239" offset="3176364">Diamond was in the audience and he asked permission to speak, when permitted to and he left without causing a disturbance, it's uncontradicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.854" offset="3290781">This was a testimony by defense witness and there was no description of that speech by the prosecution witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.140" offset="3351907">No claim that he did anything but just appear the following morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.229" offset="3368312">Now, our first argument, if there are number of things occurred in the trial which make it impossible to exclude the possibility that the trial judge relied on subsection 7 to convict Diamond.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.883" offset="3430902">In fact, we think it's very probable that he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.518" offset="4281448">Fairly, when -- when Diamond filed a motion for new trial, in which he made explicit what he assumed throughout that he was charged under subsection 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.444" offset="4333171">The Court's -- the opinion overruling this didn't contradict him in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.123" offset="4351875">It just said that the statute denouncing the crime is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.917" offset="4375071">And the Court believed there was -- he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.380" offset="4396910">And in the -- similarly, the petitioner urged in the Louisiana Supreme Court, that he was convicted under subsection 7, but that Court affirmed without discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.055" offset="4439542">It was only until we get to this Court and when the State filed its brief in our position to certiorari that the State contends that Diamond was charged with interrupting a lawful assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.788" offset="4494503">The State didn't stick to that very long because just a few months later, when they filed a brief on the merits here, they now shifted ground in our arguing that Diamond was convicted of holding an unlawful assembly and interrupting a lawful assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.714" offset="4558242">So that, that plus an examination of the charge against Diamond, it appears on the first page of the record, tends to confirm that Section -- subsection 7 may have been involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.631" offset="12197909">Now, if you look at this record and with reference to the specific charges and you find that the record is not devoid with reference to an interruption of a lawful assembly and you find that the reference that the record is not devoid of evidential foundation of -- unauthorized assembly and you find a record not to be devoid evidentiary wise in any particular phase of this case, well then I don't see how you can do anything but affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.338" offset="12368750">In -- in the State of Louisiana, in order for the higher court to overrule a criminal court -- a criminal case, not only must error be shown but prejudicial error must be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.168" offset="12436041">And of course, there's a lot of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.508" offset="12445445">We have errors all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.687" offset="12450147">I dare say that you can pick up this record and find plenty errors, counsel pointed one of mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.100" offset="12475747">He says, the trial judge was talking as if he was -- he was -- he was thinking under the provisions of Number 7 and as he said that, I found some -- some language used by the trial judge early in the case, in some informal conversation between the trial judge and -- and one of counsel for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.362" offset="12608867">At page 35 whereby he says about the middle of the page, the trial judge said, "The accused is being tried for disturbing the peace by urging them to do an unlawful claim, break up the classes."</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.077" offset="12655679">So, direct is not perfect but I submit that just because the judge may have made an error on some incidental question during the proceedings that this should not warrant this Court in -- in giving the reversal and I'm sure it would.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.985" offset="12775320">Now, this Court, of course, has recognized it -- although freedom of speech is important that it is not an absolute thing and it is subject to limitation and restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.719" offset="12826206">This Court has held that slanderous statements do not enjoy the protection of the First Amendment, First and Fourteenth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.629" offset="13373837">And immediately thereafter, counsel said about an hour, somebody in the records said, about half an hour.</text>

            <text syncTime="3732.478" offset="15033240">First, I should point out that there was no right of appeal under the state law in this case to the Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.141" offset="15075976">Just like the procedure described in -- in this Court's opinion in -- in Garner against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.622" offset="15093844">It was no right of appeals because the fine and the jail sentence were too small.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.720" offset="15110248">The only way petitioner could get review of this conviction in the State Supreme Court, was pipelined to these extraordinary reefs attempting to evoke the State Supreme Court's supervisory jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.500" offset="15161344">Now, Louisiana Supreme Court held as long ago as 1926 that in the case called State versus Mullen at 160 Louisiana 916 107 Southern 698, that where -- that the supervisory jurisdiction is involved, it suffices that the errors complained of are paid into on the face of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.372" offset="15260818">And it does not matter at all that in that case, that the bill of particulars weren't even signed by the trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3805.300" offset="15324557">There's no suggestion anywhere in any of the state court rulings that it was not ruling on the federal questions presented, though the trial judge noted this certain mistakes of counseling nevertheless, when he had ruled on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.445" offset="15393102">Now in addition, the -- the discussion of a bill of particulars, we submit that the Louisiana Supreme Court has held that this objection is not -- made by the bill of particulars, the way they make the objection about to an information is by a motion to quash and the State Supreme Court held that in the case involving its very statute which is cited on the last page of our brief and it's called State against Morgan in which also Mr. Justice Black, gives the history of this statute and whether there is parts that it came from, the statue or part (a) of in any event was passed in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.855" offset="15574810">And it -- as that Morgan case describes was an attempt to gather together offenses from various different parts of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.709" offset="15634160">I might add that there has been no state court litigation which in anyway illuminates any of this subsections.</text>
