            <text syncTime="11.049" offset="147519">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.503" offset="161416">Shortly before the adjournment yesterday, Mr. Justice White asked me some questions about the numbers of stations and summed up the figures and I affirmed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.281" offset="204466">Now to be sure that I did not misunderstand I am going to state just what the figures are.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.505" offset="229439">The reference to the record is pages 333 and 334.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.362" offset="248769">The total number of stations selling Union’s branded gasoline in California is 2,377.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.640" offset="281893">Of this number in 1,335 Union has some sort of possessory interest, either the fee or the master lease and of this 1,335 stations all but three are consignee stations, the lessee is a consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.398" offset="352946">Now of the 2,377 total stations, in 1,030; slightly less than half Union has no possessory interest of any kind whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.105" offset="395786">They are owned by other parties unconnected with any refinery, and of the 1,030 stations in which Union has no possessory interest, approximately 80% are also consignees, that is to say these 80% who have no landlord-tenant relationship to Union have chosen and preferred to be consignees instead of buying and selling and this reminds me again of the remarks made by the District Court in the West Coast Oil case when he summed up the situation, that this vast number indicates that they would prefer the security of a consignment system to the rough and tumble of being merchants buying and selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.905" offset="574986">Yesterday I but briefly indicated a statement that the Union Oil Company had not in fact violated the antitrust laws or any part of them in any respect whatsoever and I had submitted to the Court that the basic question there, the basic attack of the plaintiff, the petitioner, the fundamental one was his consignment in which the consignor determines the price at which the consignee is to sell the consignor’s gasoline is that price fixing, illegal price fixing agreement?</text>
            <text syncTime="150.709" offset="706226">And I submit it was not because one does not violate the law on determining the price at which his own property is to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.274" offset="740498">And I therefore submitted that cases like the Masonite case are not in point because Masonite was a horizontal conspiracy and of course we have no questions at all about the illegality of any kind of horizontal conspiracy about price, nor I submit were the resale price maintenance cases have any bearing here, holding vertical price fixing illegal because there was no sale and resale, although I also submitted that if this were a sale and a resale, the California Fair Trade Act and the McGuire Act would also legalize the transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.424" offset="2185070">No he doesn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.118" offset="2191862">Now in this particular case, a man named, the record shows this, a man name Gregorian had been the prior lessee and when Mr. Gregorian left and Mr. Simpson came in, Mr. Simpson bought Gregorian’s tools and there was a stock of tires and accessories which Union had nothing to do it, and Union bought those and sold it to Mr. Simpson on a conditional sales contract, financed him, but upon the gasoline he testified, this is in my brief at page 57 and from 311 of the record about this very episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.806" offset="2338565">Did pay buy the gasoline, but not gasoline?</text>
            <text syncTime="561.960" offset="2351208">He says no, it didn’t include gasoline because it was on consignment, so he never paid for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.861" offset="2378794">Now, I submit to the Court that the consignment question has been flatly ruled on by this Court in United States versus General Electric Company in 272 U.S. 476.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.527" offset="2445458">There General Electric some years before had been subjected to a decree, enjoining it from a conspiracy to fix resale prices and thereafter it devised a consignment scheme and as shown by the opinion of this Court, it presented the scheme to the Attorney General for his approval or disapproval and as the Court notes in the opinion, received no reply of any kind whatsoever, but it put the plan into effect and this Court held the consignment was clearly legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.811" offset="2566666">Now I call attention to that because in this Union’s consignment system has also been presented to the Attorney General and has been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.536" offset="2609507">I say that because in the West Coast Oil case where we hammered out a consent decree, that consent decree specifies that every refiner on the West Coast, every refiner defendant must gave to -- both a supply agreement and a lease and says the supply agreement maybe a consignment agreement or a purchase and sale agreement and it defines a consignee in the terms of the California Civil Code as an agent, who in the pursuit of an independent calling will sell the gasoline to the refiner at the prices specified by the refiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.053" offset="2751613">Now the record also -- this case discloses something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.508" offset="2769377">That decree in it's draft was clear to me, but to be sure that there was no misunderstanding with the Department of Justice, I wrote the Department of Justice a letter before I signed the consent on behalf of Union and asked if they construed it the same way and at page 330 of this record you will find a letter addressed to me from the Department of Justice saying that the provisions of that decree against resale price maintenance, and the decree went into effect I may say lay after, less or after Mr. Simpson was out of our station, says that, that of course does not apply to the consignor fixing the price at which his consignee may sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.433" offset="2925066">So unlike General Electric, Union’s plan has been before the Department of Justice, has met with no objection, and has been held to be legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.487" offset="2965295">Of course that’s not binding on the Court, but it does show what a law enforcement agency thinks of the matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="722.140" offset="2991940">Your Honor that letter appears at 330 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.263" offset="3016391">Now early this year in the State of California they finally reached -- the highest courts that had the question, appellate court, the question whether exactly this kind of consignment arrangement by a refiner violated the California antitrust law which of course is the same as the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.729" offset="3098311">And in the case Shasta Douglas Oil Company versus Work, the Court held that patently it did not, because the consignee is an agent and the consignor can set his prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.524" offset="3141465">It is very interesting to observe that only a few months ago, the Uniform State Law Commissioners had attempted to draft a Uniform State Antitrust Law prepared and as pointed out in my brief at page 41, that draft makes it explicit, that consignment transactions have not been included because the principle is at liberty to control the price and other terms upon which his agent may dispose of his commodities or service.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.349" offset="3264763">And in the famous Standard Oil versus United States in 337 U.S., the Standard Stations cases, there was as I recall the statements in the opinion and in a dissenting opinion that if exclusive dealing contracts were outlawed, the companies would very likely go back to owning their own stations and selling through their wage paid employees or through consignment, either scheme of which would be legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.494" offset="3385344">Now I therefore enquire how is it that the counsel for Mr. Simpson contends that consignment has suddenly become illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.724" offset="3418258">I had thought until yesterday at about five minutes before counsel finished his argument, that he was turning it upon the fact that there not one consignee but a great many.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.638" offset="3465906">That contention would not have been a sound contention, because exactly the same argument was made to this Court in the General Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.262" offset="3496417">In the Court’s opinion it points out how the government had argued that there were so many, such a great number of stations consignees, 401 class and 22,000 in the other and this Court said it made no difference because the distinction between agency and purchaser, be it as clear both in law and in fact that of course if you stopped to observe, the number would make no difference because economically the same result would follow if Union took over these 1,300 consignee stations and put wage paid employees in.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.731" offset="3666317">It would then control the direct retail distribution of 1,300 stations and counsel conceded in the Court below there would be nothing illegal about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.800" offset="3702575">So the illegality, if there is any, cannot come in because there is more than one station.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.624" offset="3721906">It would have to come in because it is consignment or not, and counsel as I understood in yesterday and a reply to a question by Mr. Justice White said his contention would be the same even though there was but one consignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.783" offset="3774464">Now counsel’s next point of attack if I understand him correctly is purpose, our purpose he said was to fix price.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.071" offset="3807692">Well at the time of the case heard below in order to eliminate all issues of fact I stipulated that, that was one of our purposes not that we could control a resale price, no, but so that we could control price at which our product was sold, but that’s irrelevant and let me quote to the Court from this Court’s decision in the General Electric case again.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.694" offset="3898180">“The plan was of course devised for the purpose of enabling the company to deal directly with consumers and purchasers and doubtless was indented to avoid selling the lamps owned by the company to jobbers or dealers and prevent sale by these middlemen to consumers at different and competing prices.”</text>
            <text syncTime="968.702" offset="3978219">That’s the quotation from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.039" offset="3983548">Nevertheless this Court said it made no difference, because the distinction in law and in fact between agency and sale is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.812" offset="4014582">Now at the very close of the argument yesterday, Mr. Justice White asked me why we shifted, why Union shifted in 1955, and in the haste of the red light in front of me, I did not give a full answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.250" offset="4060348">I mentioned McKesson &amp; Robbins decision had some effect upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.748" offset="4086366">The story is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.609" offset="4089814">There are of course advantages and disadvantages to each of the several merchandising methods available to a manufacturer, and he must make his choice, if he takes one he has some advantages and he has some disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.212" offset="4140178">Now another disadvantage of using middlemen, selling to them and having them resale in this business is, and this Court knows it very clearly certainly in view of the recent Sun Oil decision, the veritable host of problems and dilemmas you have under Robinson-Patman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.330" offset="4208724">Another is the fact that if you don’t sell through these stations as your agents, the quality of them can run down and they won’t give the proper service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.537" offset="4245504">Now in a Union station, they are in Union’s colors, this is where Union meets the public face-to-face, and to the public these stations are Union and Union’s reputation turns upon the kind of service it gets there and therefore the company has an interest in having something to say about those stations and of course if it sells through them and the resale it has nothing to say about them, except in a very remote kind of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.356" offset="4352815">Now these disadvantages Union wanted to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.074" offset="4363682">They could have been eliminated by doing what Standard Oil does, put wage paid employees in, but there Union ran up against what it conceived to be another disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.458" offset="4405164">A wage paid employee has no stake in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.785" offset="4422510">He is not -- he has no incentive and Union felt that if it had consignees who received a commission they would have a status of businessmen in the community, they would have an incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.881" offset="4466918">Now Union’s merchandizing judgment may have been sound, may have been unsound in weighing these advantages, but it wasn’t I submit, illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.077" offset="4503698">There were advantages not only to Union, but of course there were advantages to the consignees and we come back to the fact that 80% of those who have no landlord or tenant relationship to Union still saw fit to be consignees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.801" offset="4558555">There are disadvantages, many disadvantages to Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.316" offset="4568586">For example there was a decision rendered by an intermediate California Appellate Court last year that held Union liable for tort, personal injuries for the negligence of a consignee, because he was his agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.406" offset="4625011">So it happened that the Supreme Court set aside that decision on the grounds that there was in that case no cause or relationship on the act of any defendant in the case, but this is the kind of risk we run and we take this risk and disadvantage in order to balance off the whole picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.070" offset="4691675">More than that, not all the burdens which have been shifted from the dealer on to Union by virtue of the consignment arrangement, and this brings me directly to the question of whether is this consignment or is it sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.401" offset="4772968">Counsel has contended it’s sale, but note this is a pure question of law, counsel has never said that he intended to prove or wanted to prove that this arrangement was something other and different than what it appeared to be on the face of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.438" offset="4849142">He made clear from the very beginning that he was saying that on the face of the document he contended it was sale and one of the first pretrial conferences where we tried to delimit the issues, he said, “I say”, and I'm reading from 378 of the record, he says “I say there are two issues in this case on the issue of liability, number one the consignment agreement is unlawful on it’s face as a matter of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.682" offset="4970141">And this of course I would have no objection to presenting in a pretrial of partial summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.219" offset="4996263">The other issue he said was whether we had coerced him and I asked do you mean by coercion anymore than the fact that if you wanted our station you had to get it on the terms we offered and he says that’s all I mean, so I stipulated well those are the facts, if that’s coercion that’s coercion, which took that issue or fact out of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.308" offset="7532648">I think it is clear throughout the decided decisions of this Court that the central question is purpose and effect, regardless of the form that is used, and this is to carry out congressional purpose that any form, any scheme, any device that restrains trade and cripples the liberty of individuals, is contrary to congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.223" offset="7628257">The purpose here was not to arrive at some form of business relationship in order to give the dealers all that Union could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.632" offset="7669948">The purpose is in the record, it was to control prices in a price war situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.491" offset="7693354">The original thought here was that when the price war broke and ended that the consignment relationship would be ended and the dealers will be put back on purchase and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.603" offset="7737762">Later this was changed to make consignment a means to control prices, because the price war market was never -- had never ended and price wars continued throughout this period of time because of economic reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.303" offset="7880600">Under this consignment arrangement Union Oil wanted to control prices at individual service stations without regard to a uniform price, which is a requirement of statutory scheme and of course as this Court pointed out in McKesson &amp; Robbins either you follow the statutory scheme or you’re in per se violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.421" offset="7949040">Now 256, it says we are going to end zoning pricing and we are going to where you find it necessary to partially meet, cut price activity in the part of our major competition the retail price maybe set for any service station handling our products under our consignment agreement at $0.01 per gallon over the price of house-brand gas of a major competitor that is posted at the major station inside of our service station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.959" offset="8047156">In other words, pricing is to be based upon what can been seen by a representative of United Oil Company as he tours the area and that is going to be a different price, then he cannot, then the service stations that he cannot see, in other words you might have a distance of five blocks and you have various prices.</text>
