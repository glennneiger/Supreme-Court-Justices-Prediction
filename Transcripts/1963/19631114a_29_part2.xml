            <label>Mr. Robert S. Bourbon</label>
            <text syncTime="12.564" offset="155627">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.579" offset="175689">Because this case came in the first instance before the trial court on bill in answer I think it's somewhat important to clarify the things that have been said in the bill because this is of some importance I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.192" offset="234203">We say that initially the appellants have alleged the gross disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.487" offset="255415">I have already talked about the, what I think the implications of the gross disparity are.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.113" offset="273910">There is no question, but there is a disparity then they, they -- taking us a bit further seem to suggest at least in argument from the brief and from the bill that because of the gross disparity that there has been neglect of pressing problems of heavily populated urban and suburban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.329" offset="358755">Now, of course there is nothing in the record as to that.On the contrary this case comes to this Court on motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.166" offset="390102">Really all that there is in the record, the Court may find it quite enough, but all that there is in the record is a bill of complaint with some statistics, one of which shows population, an analysis of the disparities between the population of -- an analysis of how moneys are paid back to the various counties in relation to the way the paid them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.971" offset="481322">Now secondly it seems to me the, the appellants alleged, alleged great number of things which all of which I don't think can be laid a malapportionment, certainly it isn't shown in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.687" offset="524163">They talk about the decay of large cities, neglected expansion of suburban areas, financial planning crisis in education, housing, transportation, water, sewerage, urban redevelopment, and civil rights problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.475" offset="579333">I submit that none of these, if there facts, none of them are established in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.693" offset="608172">It's very possible and I'd like to go very quickly to the cut as I see in the State of Maryland how the disparity cuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.606" offset="643803">It's seems as if taking Baltimore City versus the less populated counties that there is disparity which runs in favor of the less populated counties and against Baltimore City.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.951" offset="693227">Taking a disparity between Baltimore City and the so-called suburban counties, the four populous counties, the disparity seems to run in favor of Baltimore City.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.381" offset="738994">Taking another disparity, there seems to be the discrepancy or disproportion between the more populated counties and the less populated county.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.336" offset="782775">So perhaps it's too easy to say that what we're talking about here is a urban-rural split.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.836" offset="812763">It may have begun that way but I doubt if it it's all that way now.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.578" offset="835751">And we -- in our brief we tried to show that the problems of the suburban counties are the problems of wealth, they're the problems of progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.013" offset="881518">The problems of Baltimore City for example or the problems of one, problems of need, the problems of the smaller counties may be said perhaps to be somewhere in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.767" offset="924463">So how does this work out?</text>
            <text syncTime="206.933" offset="933136">If apportionment -- if apportionment -- the struggle for apportionment is a struggle for power, and I think it is, then we got to situation where the more populous counties may want to be in a position to protect their accumulative wealth vis-a-vis Baltimore City, vis-Ã -vis the smaller counties and we say may not the state take this into consideration either in acting or not acting in relation to what the apportionment plan it wants to set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.959" offset="1069286">We think it may.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.091" offset="1077750">We think perhaps too little has been emphasized in this Court on the question of the burden which we have running with us as a state in favor of the system which has been set up not just by the legislature, or by the legislature changing the organic law of the state voted upon by majority of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.067" offset="1165730">In each case, the apportionment we're talking about that is result in for example in the Baltimore City situation and that's all we're really talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.112" offset="1197913">This has been attacked quite heavily, it's been ridiculed Baltimore City.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.143" offset="1214004">Baltimore City is different, Baltimore City is not a county if it were treated like a county these plaintiffs would be in here still.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.672" offset="1244097">They'd say you have one state Senator for Baltimore City, this isn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.471" offset="1263323">They'd be in here alleging disproportion and there would be at least in the figures, a disproportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.907" offset="1289028">So taking that a little further, what are we suppose to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="299.538" offset="1303552">What is the state rationally to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="302.748" offset="1316404">It -- it we think that based on the exigencies of what developed at the time that these additional changes were made governed, whether or not additional Senators ought to be allocated to Baltimore City.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.936" offset="1369172">We got six you might ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.001" offset="1377426">Suppose we had a hundred, what we say you don't have a hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.415" offset="1391114">I'm setting up a strong man, knocking it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.317" offset="1398638">I say that six is reasonable figure based upon the situation as it develop and as it's worked out now perhaps in an overall, on the overall scales, Baltimore City in relation to the Senate, is just about evenly populated.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.493" offset="1455376">So we say that they're very well made now to be a cut between the urban, the so-called, well between Baltimore City and your populated county, because one, Baltimore City is now losing its representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.130" offset="1509919">It's losing its tax base, it's got problems galore.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.491" offset="1523399">We can't deny that, as we say the problems they have to solve cost money, the problems that sub -- that the political subdivisions in the outlying areas have to solve, are problems of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.013" offset="1569479">They're problems of planning and sewage and the appellants alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.554" offset="1587660">I don't know what they are alleging.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.381" offset="1590899">They're alleging perhaps that we don't have enough sewers or maybe they're alleging that we don't have enough planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.715" offset="1620261">But all you have to do in the Maryland situation, at least in these suburban counties, is to go into those counties and find out whether there is enough planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.311" offset="1658713">The Park and Planning Commission is one of the most highly developed and emulated planning groups in the country, whereas in Suburban Sanitary Commission, by-county commission is a highly developed sewer and water organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.643" offset="1715973">They've never gone to the legislature, been denied what they needed for these counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.247" offset="1730393">And appellants can't show that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.140" offset="1741991">Where do they got their money to do these things?</text>
            <text syncTime="411.636" offset="1751918">Well they allocated tax, apart tax, they allocate a sewer tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.322" offset="1774696">The money comes from these counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.877" offset="1784936">In this connection, I should like to at least comment in passing upon counsel statement that the crisis in education.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.360" offset="1822866">This crisis in education, supposedly in planning and money are due to malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.050" offset="1841570">Montgomery County from which I come from and from which Mr. Scanlan come, we live in the same neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.009" offset="1865498">The money for Montgomery County in the education field can -- can it be said that the money that they get back should be in direct relation to the way they paid it in?</text>
            <text syncTime="451.038" offset="1909593">The whole, the whole structure of the school system in Maryland, the educational system is for the more populous, more prosperous counties to help carry the burden for the least prosperous.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.631" offset="1959957">And I think a study of the system in Maryland would show that for example Garrett County can't carry a school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.717" offset="1980332">It's got problems, it's in most of their -- a lot of their land up there is state land.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.012" offset="2001439">A lot of its land, it's un develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.019" offset="2009485">People aren't living there yet, maybe 50 years from now they will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.406" offset="2023069">Montgomery County is a bit different, but the appellants want money back in direct relation to the way apparently that's paid in and there is no principle of government that I know of that requires that you get paid back in direct relation to the way you pay in.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.888" offset="2076985">I submit it's not a Maryland system and certainly hasn't been the federal system it's just -- it's just -- it's just common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.435" offset="2123170">You say further, one of the main allegations apparently if you cut through the bare, the bare bones of this thing is that the State Senate won't pass all the bills that the House sends it.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.803" offset="2164652">We say that's -- that can't be, that can't be standard by which this Court judges the responsiveness of the State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.501" offset="2191402">There are all kinds as I say, of other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.259" offset="2202478">The items suggested and cited by appellant or not after bill, there's many of them that, that there are very serious study.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.033" offset="2237586">For example there was one bill cited by appellants as showing that the Senate had been unresponsive, irresponsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.694" offset="2272172">It failed to pass a bill which would have really made it easier for some people to get small loans easier and of course it would have raised the interest rate that's the reason the Senate didn't pass it.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.385" offset="2314909">It wasn't in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.192" offset="2322223">This is cited as for example of progressive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.869" offset="2336852">But when we get in this Court and start talking about the merits of legislation, we're far field really from somewhat this Court's function would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.050" offset="2369661">Now, we say this, in touching on the federal system, I haven't got too much time left.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.251" offset="2402471">Say what you may about the analogy, the so-called federal analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.206" offset="2422220">The federal system is not a pure federal system even under contemporate political standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.770" offset="2444476">Say what you want about the federal system, can it be denied that a state which sets up it's system generally in agreement with the so-called federal system that this Constitution which we're talking about will find.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.623" offset="2495885">One, irresponsible and unreasonable and protect the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="601.302" offset="2510618">We say this is, the federal system itself shows the general reasonableness of the plan in the states where you have consensus government.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.116" offset="2545936">This is the proposition advanced by Professor Dickson of Washington, George Washington University, that what you're really talking about is consensus government.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.022" offset="2577492">If you're going to have one man run -- one rule -- one man, one vote, you're going to have endless problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.118" offset="2597867">One man, one vote can't be applied in these state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.884" offset="2612914">Gray v. Sanders is a case all its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.126" offset="2625975">You may -- the Solicitor General may say that it's dispositive of this case but -- but we know it is not because it -- it just simply can't be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.385" offset="2658994">We'll have district line running through my backyard perhaps, and we'll have endless litigation for years to come on this so-called one man, one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.124" offset="2693893">Because all that has to happen is for the Federal Government to take for example a -- a federal installation and put it in Garrett County, which withdraw within three years, two years, 50,000 people to Garrett County.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.815" offset="2740705">Immediately, the whole system's thrown into -- into an imbalance because population is your standard, so we say that -- that one man, one vote isn't helping this Court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.802" offset="2788665">When you -- when -- when appellants and the Solicitor General come before this Court and set a standard such as that or something that's almost next to it or almost akin to it, that haven't helped the Court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.252" offset="2830461">The Court's still reaching out for standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.694" offset="2844150">Now, the obvious standard that the Court, I would think is going to -- to take into consideration is the population standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.433" offset="2875183">Now, we say this, that the -- that the Maryland System, if it has not arrived at a purely populated basis is working its way there.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.572" offset="2915725">We can't say that there are not disparities in the present healthy delegate setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.095" offset="2929831">But we say, based on -- based on what happened, based on the various court cases in Maryland, the action of a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.172" offset="2958148">This is the goal and that this Court ought to recognize that the State is working towards that and not intervene at this point and consider for example, a Senate in context with the House which -- which is malapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.113" offset="3009870">We say this malapportioned in the spirit, in the context of what this Court we think ought to be doing in this cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.181" offset="3034112">If the House of Delegates is properly apportioned or nearly so or it looks as if it will be so shortly, then the Court can go to this, squarely to the question which this case I think, presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.728" offset="3080296">That's a question of whether the State may take its own form of government, may setup its own form of government as it has here, and not deviate from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.550" offset="3115614">How -- how reasonable, how rationale must we be to satisfy the Solicitor General?</text>
            <text syncTime="756.800" offset="3132646">So from the beginning, history, geography supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.406" offset="3147065">We've never changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.212" offset="3150305">Each county has had one representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.045" offset="3161590">As we say, the legislature, as the years have gone through, can look at this situation and see this, this thing that's growing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.939" offset="3189175">Sure, there's a population growth in the suburbs, but the State -- this is the -- this thing up here, the State, we talked about it but it's a -- it's really hard to picture it really.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.939" offset="3245181">The State has looked through its legislature at these developments and it says, we -- we'd like not to have as we'd illustrate it, we'd like not to have Baltimore City and Baltimore County which right now, have almost half the population there on the center of Maryland, have a rule, majority rule in both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.802" offset="3320623">May not the State do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="805.382" offset="3326997">Because if the State doesn't have the right to do that then I suggest you talk about minority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.428" offset="3351134">Minority rights will truly be submerged in Maryland and will submerge in any other state where this type of thing happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.096" offset="3377779">Because if we go to a population basis that the appellant suggest in Maryland, we're going to have a complete submerge of -- of the rights of the majo -- of the minority, because even now, with Baltimore counties progressing -- progression in population, it won't be very long before as I say, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, they have -- they have an identity in some extent -- to some extent of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.569" offset="3479656">They're the logical ones to want to see its power and when we say see its power in our argument of brief, and the newspapers took it up as -- as indicating something more insidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.280" offset="3526572">We don't mean that, this is -- this is a question of power, sheer power in the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.399" offset="3547052">If you've got the votes, you may want to do something with those votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.938" offset="3561159">You may want to vote in something that isn't in the interest of the state at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.728" offset="3576310">This is the problem; this is what we're worried about.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.652" offset="3588012">We say that the State may -- may look at its own system and may set off these various interests in its State Senate which it had done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.735" offset="8364345">State governments usually conform to three general categories, one, in which a population is used as the basic or primary standard in one House and pure political subdivisions are used as the basis for apportionment in a second house.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.727" offset="8896303">The third category of states have population as the basis of apportionment in both Houses, Alabama, Indiana, Oklahoma are examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.695" offset="8932248">But Alabama and Indiana by constitutional amendments that have been proposed are trying to move into the first category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.279" offset="8958579">Now, we setup these categories or I might say that Maryland, we consider a variant in the first category where the only discrepancy in the Senate is that Baltimore, the City of Baltimore is given especial treatment otherwise it is population basically in one House and counties in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.282" offset="9030572">We setup these categories because we feel that in answering the validity and the seeking standards for determining the validity of the first category, it will make answers to the remainder very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.678" offset="9088146">Actually, there's no problem with the third category, both Houses are on a population basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.791" offset="9108626">The second category has some special problems because you are sometimes or rather artificially dividing or combining counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.019" offset="9137465">But the first category presents the greatest disparities in per capita population in one House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.984" offset="9161394">In New Jersey, it's 20 to 1, smallest to the largest counties with 19% controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.114" offset="9181874">And in Vermont, it goes up to 900 or over 900 to 1 because one town only has 38 people and one other town has over 34,000 in Vermont and it only takes 11% to control the Vermont Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.246" offset="9254390">Now, can we justify the first category?</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.904" offset="9269018">In looking for standards, we feel that the first place to look is the Guaranty Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.629" offset="9291901">It's amazing that there's been so much argument in these cases for three days and Solicitor General Cox has never once mentioned the Guaranty Clause, Mr. (Inaudible) of Alabama was kind enough to admit that he thought there was some -- might be some standards there and we think, it's the most appropriate clause to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.971" offset="9357312">It deals directly with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.866" offset="9368910">If you read the clause, it tells us something about our problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.395" offset="9383016">The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union, a Republican form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.386" offset="9406945">Now, we have to ask what is a permissible Republican form of government?</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.145" offset="9421991">What does the clause mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.920" offset="9429096">Well we start with its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.201" offset="9434216">We think it means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.118" offset="9441844">The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a Republican form government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.305" offset="9462638">Now, we know from the debates in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, it meant at least that a state could not adopt a monarchy because they said, if one state did it, others might and then the whole union will be jeopardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.981" offset="9517390">But we think there is a little bit more meaning to be gleamed from the debates because Madison proposed that the cause read slightly differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.648" offset="9556052">He said that, the Constitutions of each state and the existing laws of each state should be guaranteed by the United States and I think it was, I'm not sure, it might have been Wilson of Pennsylvania who suggested the final form of the language but I don't there was any meaning or change of intent and if we look at what Madison said in the Federalist No. 42, it bears out what he said during the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.202" offset="9678200">The existing Constitutions or the existing forms of government the states had were to be guaranteed and any state can -- could choose another Republican form and claim for the guarantee of this constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.110" offset="9741834">Now, we'll come back to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.962" offset="9761270">We also think there's room for play in the Equal Protection Clause and that it has application to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.747" offset="9788437">We think that the two clauses should be juxtaposed in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.729" offset="9808290">That the Guaranty Clause we say, guarantees a state to choose a form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.542" offset="9827621">It maybe category one, population of one House areal or rather political subdivision, bases in another House, it maybe category three, if a state likes though some have chosen, they can select population as the base of apportionment in both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.187" offset="9894181">In making this choice of a form of government, we think the States have complete sovereignty and complete discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.509" offset="9927408">Now, in the application or implementation of the form of government, we would say, the Equal Protection Clause has application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.565" offset="9955725">In other words, when a state says, we're going to choose a county form or political subdivision basis in one House, it must be not invidious in the application of that form and in that respect, it answers Mr. Justice Black's question but if a state says by its Constitution or by its practice, that every county shall get one vote, it couldn't say, Cape May County is to be excluded because it's too far South, we don't like them there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.009" offset="11205423">But over 200 towns -- 225 towns to be exact in Vermont have less than 4,000 population per town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.436" offset="11243144">And so, in effect, they have a rule of majority of towns voting and there is a unanimity or -- or some general conformity of interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.501" offset="11287448">As a matter of fact, Vermont came into the union in 1791 with a unicameral legislature with 50 to 1 ratios and it was admitted to the union, no one thought that was bad, 22% of the population ruled the one House that made all the legislation for Vermont but it was admitted to the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.176" offset="11690151">Now, the real question that we have tried to address ourselves principally to the brief, in the brief is this, must majority rule be the standard for two Houses in the legislature?</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.962" offset="11741247">We say, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.957" offset="11749292">Almost all of those on the other side say, yes, but we don't know where they get it from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.564" offset="11767683">Mr. Cox said in his brief, that it was -- it was the Delegates to the Federal Constitutional Convention were in general agreement that the standard, whatever they had for the Federal Government, the standard for the states is population for both Houses of Legislature.I don't find that in the constitutional debates at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.124" offset="11857962">In fact, I find quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.659" offset="11868097">Governor Randolph in his introduction of the resolutions that became the basis for our Federal Constitution said, but we must guard against ma -- majority, the excesses of democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.244" offset="11914386">He said, we thought we had a strong Senate in Virginia but we found it wasn't strong enough and Maryland too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.661" offset="11936016">I think he said, found their Senate was just a phantom and New York and Massachusetts too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.419" offset="11959108">Even Madison who proposed proportionate representation for both of the Federal Houses of legislature, say that the same time and he repeated this in the Federalist No. 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.058" offset="12013652">He said that the same time, there is a difference between Democracy and Republican Government and in for -- using representative forms of government, we must divide our society into so many parts that the majority -- the major faction will have difficulty in uniting and having their way to the exclusion of the will of the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.929" offset="12097139">So we find no unanimity as a matter of fact, I like to quote Mr. Chie -- Mr. Gorham of Massachusetts who expressly said, "There is a need to protect minority groups from oppression by the majority," and he said, "This remark was applicable not only to states but to counties or other districts of the same state."</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.497" offset="12211451">And incidentally, we draw some comfort in using the federal analogy from this language, it's at page 29 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.939" offset="12241126">More recently, Woodrow Wilson said, "The Senate, the Federal Senate, says as often from headlong popular attorney."</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.034" offset="12277593">Our view is that an intentional check upon the majority rule in both Houses is a rational objective of state bicameral government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.033" offset="12325554">Forms of representative government, commonly and historically employed by the states should serve as a guide to what is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.034" offset="12357528">We refer to Vermont, Arizona came in after the Fourteenth Amendment in 1912 with two senators per county and discrepancies of 9-to-1 with 27% controlling one House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.512" offset="12403503">Hawaii and Alaska came in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.117" offset="12413848">United States Commerce specifically said in their Act of Admission, they comply with the Federal Constitution, their Constitutions did and interestingly enough in 1962 for current acceptance of this thesis, the voters in Colorado rejected a referendum which would have provided proportionate representation in both Houses and every county in the state including the central areas, the East -- Eastern Slopes which have a -- the largest portion of population in Colorado, even they voted against equal representation, proportioned at the population of both Houses and the public selected a principle which falls into our second category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.377" offset="12586883">In New Jersey of course, we've had this form of government since 1776.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.351" offset="12602870">Before the Federal Government had it, we think it's good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.377" offset="12614886">In Illinois, recently was upheld the 1954 Amendment to the Illinois Constitution where the Court said, "The apportionment was on an arbitrary, clearly political compromised motivated area of basis and upheld it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.667" offset="12672042">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.677" offset="12676117">Because they said, "Cook County and Chicago can rule one House but we don't think Illinois has to accept their rule in both Houses," and they had an -- an area principle to protect the downstate counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.141" offset="12730034">I'd like to -- my time is running out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.917" offset="12745080">I'd like to say that equal protection means more than mathematical equality, it also means protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.354" offset="12770785">Our argument is that majority rule in both Houses, does not afford adequate protection or minority interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.849" offset="12796803">The majority has the one House that usually elects the Senate or the Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.923" offset="12813103">It usually elects highway commissioners who decide where highways had to go and we think that the minority in one branch of the legislative government should have some bargaining power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.107" offset="12865870">We also think that there's some rejection of minority rule as of -- as a governing principle in the Federal Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.167" offset="12898053">For example, if there's a tie in the vote for the President, it goes into the House of Representatives with each state having just one vote, so the population doesn't rule there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.345" offset="12938804">My time is up and I'd like to say in conclusion as we did in our brief that it's not irrational for a wagon driver when urging his horse down a hill to keep one hand on the break and that's what we think this form of government does that we're espousing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.056" offset="13761661">11 of the 13 colonies had bicameral legislatures, and most -- and -- and a -- in all -- in seven of those, you had only one House based on a non-population standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.183" offset="13858105">Now, whether a state should be able to set up a system of minority rule in both Houses, I think there is room for this Court to interpret that Guaranty Clause to determine whether that's the kind of representative government that is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.985" offset="13929368">And if it's not, then it would be -- we'd be within the power of the Court to use the Equal Protection Clause to cut it down if it felt that this denied equal protection or was invidiously discriminatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3786.237" offset="15250328">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.401" offset="15251059">He said -- I -- I -- I don't want -- I -- I don't know whether I understand you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.628" offset="15263911">I thought the amicus said that the Maryland case presents a situation where you have a House based on population and the Senate chosen on another basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.337" offset="15302781">It does not because the fact is and I can concede this away if I wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.185" offset="15322112">As I said earlier, if you like conceding that the sun rises in the East -- in the West.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.312" offset="15342696">The fact is that the Maryland House is not based on population and I gave you the figures as I started the rebuttal the way this -- if that were the case, if that -- if we had 105 delegates or something close to that, say 100, then he could make this argument and then my adversary could say, "This case involves the federal plan."</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.613" offset="15419914">I don't think even if it did involve the federal plans make any difference for the reason stated in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.845" offset="15436842">But believe me, this case does not involve a federal plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.251" offset="15450425">If this is the federal plan, then any state can avail -- avoid the force of Baker v. Carr by just creating some sort of a second House and you might as well have not decided the Baker v. Carr but believe me, Your Honors, it wouldn't mean nothing at all.</text>
