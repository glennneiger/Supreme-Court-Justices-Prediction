            <text syncTime="60.020" offset="343437">The nature of this case is an alleged unreasonable search and seizure by means of an electronic listening device.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.125" offset="375829">The issues here are whether a city police officer have used an electronic listening device stuck into a party wall and this enabled him to hear everything that went on in the adjoining efficiency apartment occupied by the petitioner, constituted an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.925" offset="451062">In addition to this issue, the respondent had raised four questions before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.760" offset="478438">He has suggested that although this search took place for three days before the arrest of the petitioner that the search was valid as incident to a legal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.137" offset="523891">He selected that -- suggested that because the petitioner was suspected of running an illegal place that she forfeited her rights under the Fourth Amendment and he's also suggested that evidence obtained by electronic means should not be completely excluded, which point the petitioner does not state and he also asked this Court to review all the evidence if it finds there was -- the evidence found by the police officer was improper and find that there was other sufficient evidence to find the accused guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.287" offset="672475">This is sort of a harmless error doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.652" offset="685955">The issue as to the unreasonable search and seizure by the electronic listening device, the trial court and the Commonwealth of Virginia are not required to write a written opinion and just rule that it was a proper search and seizure by -- and let the evidence in.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.386" offset="752933">The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia held that there was not a showing of a physical trespass by this spike.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.887" offset="1330970">If the Court please, I submit this question of what constitutes unreasonable search and seizure should -- should be faced by the problems that we -- modern technology and invention have developed to our forefathers of -- who are present at the time of the beginning of the revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.287" offset="1428564">The problem wasn't reasonably simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.293" offset="1436505">They merely broke in the hearths.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.970" offset="1447267">But now, we have this problem of the electronic eavesdropper.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.447" offset="1465135">This Court has cited the eavesdroppers, the volume by (Inaudible) and it's well aware of the large problems that electronic surveillance present nowadays.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.943" offset="1515186">We -- we have pointed out in the eavesdroppers, the volume, this question of a sonic wave flooding a room and bringing it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.887" offset="1558967">But I suggest to the Court that its decision in Silverman created a new standard as to what constituted an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.713" offset="1602226">Before Silverman beginning with Olmstead, it was held Olmstead being a tapping the telephone line, that there had to be a physical trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.673" offset="1646111">It constituted the unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.025" offset="1655515">It acquainted the actual physical trespass of the police officer into the premises of the petitioner with the unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.134" offset="1695953">This was adhered to in Goldman.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.761" offset="1706402">But in Silverman, with the case of the -- despite that it went in six to seven inches and made contact with the dock of the heating system and it appropriated the whole heating system of the adjoining building.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.721" offset="1762304">This Court said at two places that it didn't turn upon the technicalities of local trespass law.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.289" offset="1788531">Silverman case did not turn upon the niceties of local trespass on a party wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.765" offset="1814444">Principle was enunciated in Silverman, it was a case turned upon the -- the reality of an actual intrusion into a constitutionally protected area.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.492" offset="1865331">And if Your Honor please, I submit that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.055" offset="1883617">The section on tools and dash and open a sports book, the eavesdropper points out that a contact mic, a spike mic is use to get access into a room where you don't have a way to get in there, any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.743" offset="1950386">And that despite by making contact with a stud allows you to get access to the room and hear what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.874" offset="1982882">Now, the respondent wrote, Professor Schwartz, a letter on that which appears in page 17 of his brief but I believe it proved too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.242" offset="2028335">Professor Schwartz emphasized there that walls have a dead air space between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.970" offset="2051218">And that this usually, this speaks to me as a layman, a sort of an insulated situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.031" offset="2075460">And the sounds don't come through this dead air space and Professor Schwartz said that "unless you have a spike mic that go through that, it's quite likely that no other microphone would also work."</text>
            <text syncTime="509.085" offset="2139721">That's -- now when -- but this -- this is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.255" offset="2164381">What constitutes unreasonable search and seizure?</text>
            <text syncTime="520.602" offset="2185801">I submit to the Court that as I read Silverman versus United States, it does set up this new standard of reality of an actual intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.759" offset="2226448">It doesn't speak of a physical intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.199" offset="2240136">And then under this new standard, that the search and seizure of the instant case is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.880" offset="2282872">I suggest that the Court should again reemphasize the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.746" offset="2302307">It -- it is a standard that has meaning in our present day under our present day means of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.003" offset="2335431">And in -- in -- as Justice Brandeis said in his dissent in the Olmstead case, a discovery and invention can find means much greater than constriction on the rack to hearing or disclosing what was whispered in a closet.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.987" offset="6427355">And secondly, there was no unreasonable search as condemned by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.012" offset="6455463">And thirdly, the evidence complained of did not contribute to the conviction of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.314" offset="6508648">Oh, to understand the case, I would think it would necessarily give you some point of background as to what -- why the officers were in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.098" offset="6551803">This thing, I'm making a (Inaudible) a quasi criminal to suggest -- it kind of hurts me because they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.058" offset="6583568">In other words, the officers there, to do their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.810" offset="6590568">Now, the duty of the officers there was to watch the apartment, put the woman under surveillance by the law of a police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.127" offset="6643858">Now, the -- the evidence is amply clear here that she had -- that -- of a reputation in the community, what she was doing now for years and years and the officer in the surveillance appears they -- he didn't get into car at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.960" offset="6731212">He stayed in asleep in this car and watching the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.129" offset="6751901">What did he observe?</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.116" offset="6759842">Observed the parents of the defendant there, with her husband from time to time and they tried to kill men and women, the young women and men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.279" offset="6820446">It added to the -- in another feature, they found that the -- the apartment was rented by the defendant in a false name, in other words, in another name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.966" offset="6871228">They didn't disclose their real name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.906" offset="6890977">So honestly, from the very beginning, the -- what the officers knew there, this woman was operating this house of prostitution and that was the purpose of renting the apartment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.638" offset="6965896">And she used -- and she rented this apartment for the sole purpose of operating a house of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.832" offset="7014693">Now, it's come to the Honorable Court to relieve them the responsibility of that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.262" offset="7060459">Your Honor, if it please Your Honor, the police department violated the provisions of the Fourth Amendment and they get around it like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.296" offset="7228583">One count was the -- count number one was a violation of Section 208 or 18.228 of the code which makes it unlawful to obtain money from a prostitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.762" offset="7330461">A female engaged in the occupation of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.196" offset="7372152">The other count was pleasing a female in a house of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.738" offset="7406320">Separate sections of the code of Virginia, separate crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.158" offset="7435995">And the one in which she was found guilty was the one that according to the determination made by the Supreme Court of Appeals was that statute that makes it unlawful for a person to obtain money from a prostitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.083" offset="7519692">Share in this -- no question about the -- of the guilt there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.204" offset="7544142">The -- the reason that -- the -- that the termination was made by the Court of Appeals on -- in that and this isn't the -- the penalty proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.478" offset="7585311">The jury gave her a $500 fine and five years in -- in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.882" offset="7614882">The -- of the youth -- the penalty of both operating in the house of prostitution on the other hand, is a minimum fine of a $1000 and the -- I think a maximum 10-year imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.634" offset="7681860">Obviously, she wasn't found guilty of that by the jury, affirmed by the trial court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.522" offset="7729507">The Court of Appeals of Virginia stated that in the -- in it -- in the -- in the record here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.947" offset="7831176">They call -- Virginia says the jury found defendant guilty as charged under the first count and fixed her punishment to five years imprisonment and a fine of $500.</text>

            <text syncTime="2743.091" offset="11075688">This is the question because we had here Katherine Taylor, the main prosecution witness who admitted to previous prostitution and admitted that she was living illicitly with a man during this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.530" offset="11137442">And the question was whether she had moved up in the ranks of the working girl to the rank of management for which case Katherine Clinton would not have been guilty of this offense.</text>
