            <text syncTime="11.857" offset="150758">On Thursday, I pointed out that this appeal involves a construction and application of the Transportation Act of 1958 which imposed on truck transportation of certain agricultural commodities, economic regulation, rate and operating authority regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.220" offset="232260">But which directed the Commission to issue operating authority to truckers in bona fide operation on May 1, 1958 over any route or routes or within any territory, transporting this agricultural commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.482" offset="301328">This provision, directing the issue on some operating rights, was designed to assure that these previously unregulated truckers could continue in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.401" offset="348975">I also pointed out that the Interstate Commerce Commission had interpreted and applied this statute to Shaw, the appellant here, a substantial common carrier of refrigerated and frozen agricultural commodities so as to limit sharply Shaw's future operations as compared with his prior bona fide operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.832" offset="442702">The Commission did this by ignoring the transportation characteristics of the frozen fruits, frozen vegetables and frozen berries involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.744" offset="482304">And the Commission wholly ignored the scope of service, actually held out by Shaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.628" offset="505919">The Commission in fact refused to receive or consider evidence of Shaw's ability to perform on the ground that such evidence was irrelevant to its determination under the statute as it was being applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.370" offset="568822">The Commission fragmented Shaw's prior operations into a series of disconnected and unrelated shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.703" offset="602154">The result is completely unrelated to operating reality for any trucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.984" offset="627336">The Commission for example, would permit only frozen fruit to be carried to some points, frozen vegetables to others, frozen berries to still others.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.389" offset="744887">The Commission held that they could transport frozen fruits, vegetables and berries as I said on Thursday, to a point such as Kansas City, but from precisely the same origin point, only frozen berries to say Saint Joseph, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.994" offset="803297">Now, this is entirely unrealistic to any trucker.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.046" offset="831509">It was based on that mere fact and this fact alone that Shaw had not in fact during the period of the Commission considered relevant, transported a shipment of frozen Vegetables from the Lower Peninsula of Michigan to Saint Joseph, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.602" offset="897755">In the Carolina Freight Carriers case, this Court said that that kind of treatment as applied to a common carrier was a misapplication of the statutory standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.137" offset="979884">I think they -- they could restrict into the areas in which it was demonstrated that he had in fact served geographically.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.420" offset="1005066">That is -- we'll take another example Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.474" offset="1017292">Take it -- take the point that he's home based in lower -- in Fort Smith, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.987" offset="1039339">Now, the Interstate Commerce Commission said that this -- this common carrier was entitled to transport frozen vegetable from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Miami and Jacksonville, Florida, to San Francisco, California frozen -- frozen berries to Chicago, Illinois and frozen vegetables to Detroit, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.898" offset="1122931">Now, it would be impossible to have a more fragmented theory of any common carrier's operation to have points so far separated within the United States and never consider the intermediate points in areas to which a carrier must necessarily transport these products in order to get to Jacksonville or Miami, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.071" offset="1215613">For example, as we point out in the brief, the Commission wholly ignored the fact that on the very shipment that they went to Miami, they took a shipment to Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.593" offset="1249782">No authority was given to transport any shipment to Atlanta, why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.634" offset="1265873">No trucker would ever transport failed to serve intermediate points such as that, intermediate areas such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.924" offset="1299101">The -- the point -- entire theory along which the Commission proceeded was as Mr. Justice Goldberg said.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.127" offset="1327835">They took a list of what he did in 1957 and they fragmented its future operations directly to that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.058" offset="1359600">That, as I suggested to the Court on Thursday, is a flatly a violation of the statutory interpretation of the -- and of the application that this Court directed a similar language in 1935 in the Carolina case.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.831" offset="1870660">In terms of his advertising to the public of where he said, I will handle it for you if you will give it to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.768" offset="1898454">He not only put in the evidence what he actually had transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.255" offset="1916426">He put into evidence this exhibit or attempted to put in evidence this exhibit but the Commission wouldn't receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.504" offset="1945370">Only two pages of this exhibit are repeated or are -- are printed in the transcript of record because it wasn't received in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.170" offset="1976090">Now, what was the exhibit?</text>
            <text syncTime="470.088" offset="1983718">The exhibit was an attempt on his part to show that he had empty trucks available in these areas for which he solicited the business of transporting frozen fruits, frozen berries and frozen vegetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.280" offset="2040456">How else would he able to show that he had been holding out this service?</text>
            <text syncTime="487.804" offset="2054562">How else would he show as this Court suggested he should show in (Inaudible) that he was in fact able to perform and that any hiatus in his service was not an occasion where he had limited his service or in which his service had been withheld from the public because he decided to transport only from here to there.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.099" offset="2143796">But because of factors over which no common carrier can control, that is whether the public decide to use his service today, tomorrow or next month.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.256" offset="2184443">And -- and you will not find, if you read the order of the Commission, one finding, so far as I can determine, nothing in this order suggest that the Commission gave any such consideration to this carrier's operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.560" offset="2249644">It was a mechanistic production by which they attempted to give him on arithmetical majority for the future of the precise shipments, fragmented as they were that he had transported during 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.544" offset="2309517">Now, the -- this order, Mr. Chief Justice denies to Shaw, operating rights for the future to which he is entitled.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.336" offset="2368763">He also denies to the public the competing operations which Shaw held out.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.592" offset="2393736">And as I have told you, at -- had in fact available in the form of empty vehicles, moved from that point because at that time, there was no such traffic to another point where there was traffic, considering the variations involved, and it denies to them the kinds of common carrier service which Shaw had in fact available.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.706" offset="2486209">And it was able to prove in the form of this refrigerated truck to shippers and receivers of these agricultural products.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.042" offset="2627584">A carrier of commodities made non-exempt by the Transportation Act of 1958, frozen fruits, frozen berries, frozen vegetables, ham, coffee beans or others of the 11, may obtain authority to carry those commodities in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.242" offset="2704384">He may apply under Section 207 of the Interstate Commerce Act, showing a need for the service and the fitness to carry the commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.073" offset="2743672">He may also apply for grandfather rights, provided he may show that as a carrier, he was in bona fide operation carrying the particular commodities on the grandfather date and thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.545" offset="2805530">This case arose on applicant Shaw's application for grandfather rights to carry frozen fruits, frozen berries and frozen vegetables and fish and mixed loads with those commodities to and from 35 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.247" offset="2876374">This Court, in the cases interpreting the grandfather clause in the 1935 Motor Carrier Act, which first imposed economic regulation of motor carriers, this Court stated that it did not sit to weigh the evidence to determine the scope of the bona fide operations of the carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.904" offset="5070973">And it limited the authority from Birmingham to a radius of 10 miles around Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.859" offset="5094797">The contention was made that it should've granted an originating authority from a radius of a hundred miles around Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.908" offset="5126980">And this Court, in its opinion, that 498 reviewed that evidence and said that there were only 55 shipments from the area beyond 10 miles and within the hundred-mile radius whereas there were a larger number, 875 within the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.519" offset="5213497">Then it said, "After the grandfather date, there were 270 shipments from the area between 10 miles and a hundred-mile radius."</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.518" offset="5525400">And in fact, we find right in the words chosen by commerce later on, wool tops and noils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.708" offset="5550164">They didn't say "wool tops, wool noils."</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.260" offset="5560404">What they said, "wool tops and noils."</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.512" offset="5569390">And we would assume that if you transported a load of wool tops, you'd get authority for wool noils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.898" offset="5594990">But here, where the Commission took the seriatim listing, frozen fruits, frozen berries and frozen vegetables, we read that to mean that each of those is a separate commodity class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.862" offset="5638771">And indeed, let's not -- it should be recognized that frozen vegetables is a commodity class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.499" offset="5669386">If the carrier transports black-eyed peas, Georgia to Wyoming, the carrier will obtain authority for frozen vegetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.839" offset="5702719">There's no question here that the Commission denied him authority to carry frozen cauliflower, collards or Brussels sprouts or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.925" offset="5735111">He got full commodity class authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.365" offset="5748799">We don't see that in his argument that this is a -- a single class, why or how he can make a distinction that if you carry frozen fruits, you shouldn't also get authority to carry him for wool tops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.258" offset="5804387">Indeed, reading the legislative history, there's no suggestion that the three are part of a single class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.041" offset="5831555">The Congress in its -- in the conference report and each of the reports of the Senate and House Committees, carries a paragraph describing the grandfather rights, and I'm quoting, "Any person engaged on May 1, 1958, in trucking the aforementioned commodities which are returned to regulation by this amendment, would be permitted upon application to a certificate or permit allowing him under regulation to continue transportation of the same commodities within the same areas for the same points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.745" offset="5970317">Now, the only reasonable reading that we can see of that is that this is a class-to-class relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.255" offset="5996440">There are 11 classes listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.156" offset="6003963">If you transported one commodities in one class within an area or from point-to-to point and you show it, then you'll get authority for that commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.144" offset="6043982">We don't believe that the Carolina Carriers case at all is contrary to the decision reached by the Commission and the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.174" offset="6080031">In that case, the Court, this Court set aside a Commission decision, saying it had itemized prior transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.707" offset="6114200">But the facts and the wording of the 1935 statute are very different and importantly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.782" offset="6146487">There, the common carrier was a carrier of general commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.614" offset="6165817">General commodities is a class, was recognized by a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.758" offset="6186402">What the Commission did in weighing the evidence there, it found that there had been representative transportation of particular commodities within the general commodity class and it granted authority limited to those commodities within the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.401" offset="6252962">It's again as if there had been transportation of the black-eyed peas and the grant here had been limited to black-eyed peas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.553" offset="6281592">And the Commission said, "There shall not be itemization."</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.619" offset="6293817">It meant that if you -- that the -- pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.982" offset="6303326">When the Court said, "There shall not be itemization", it meant that where you find representative shipments of commodities within a class, the grant shall be -- for the entire class.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.529" offset="6405517">If I understand you there, the question of -- of whether that these are separate classes, these three frozen fruits, frozen berries and frozen vegetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.620" offset="6445850">They have been consistently interpreted as separate classes by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.144" offset="6463927">But it has been tested in the Courts and the Commission has been affirmed except in the Winter Garden case and in that case, as we pointed out in our brief, the shipments were from the -- Court found on the facts that the shipments originated fruits, berries and vegetables all from the same location, same warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.133" offset="6559953">And therefore, the question that the separate commodity has really been derived, although the Court had statements in its opinion saying it -- which would be read as indicating these are separate classes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.236" offset="6600286">You know Mr. Pollak, if -- if a carrier isn't applying for authority in the 207, ever asked for just authority to transport frozen vegetables for example, compared with the frozen fruits?</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.849" offset="6666742">I would assume they probably asked for more authority than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.547" offset="6677608">Although, Mr. Justice White, there are many areas of the country where only frozen vegetables maybe grown and I would assume that from that particular area, or a processing area, they probably would ask for a limited authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.908" offset="6734973">After -- after all, the -- a review of the evidence here shows that in those -- in the example of the Arkansas authority which was here granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.666" offset="6790040">But a review of the evidence showed that there were -- in the period before and after the grandfather right which the statute required, they didn't transport the three commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.591" offset="6905710">He has been operating and the -- the counsel has suggested a substantial operation since 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.298" offset="6936534">And I think the Commission has taken into consideration in this vast exhibit which starts at 205 and runs to 323 listing 5000 shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.346" offset="6984808">The Commission has taken all those into consideration and we reviewed the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.344" offset="7004766">There's a question here whether prior to 1957 should've been taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.261" offset="7024410">We've reviewed that evidence and it doesn't show that it would've enlarged the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.369" offset="7044890">The Commission has taken all those shipments into consideration where the carrier who has been successful, its financial status seems to be improving, its number of trucks and trailers is growing, the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.823" offset="7098702">And I would say that since it's taken all shipments into consideration, it's not going to suffer empty back hauls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.420" offset="7125034">Either -- either it did -- it had empty back hauls in the years passed and they weren't reflected in the shipments or it didn't have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.655" offset="7157948">But to the extent that the back hauls were not empty, they've been taken into consideration to the extent they were empty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.924" offset="7183026">This was a problem that they had in the past and has been very economically successful carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.520" offset="7201416">I -- I would say that on the basis of the record, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.692" offset="7218134">Now, the -- the point -- when the argument was made that a holding out should be sufficient, I think that the statements of the Court in the Carolina Carriers case are quite specific that a holding out is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.750" offset="7302353">The Court there said that it makes clear that a holding out to serve a specified area is not alone sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.592" offset="7333700">It's actual rather potential or simulated service which is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.011" offset="7355434">The point later it said, "It is plain that a carrier's holding out an actual performance maybe limited to a few articles only."</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.534" offset="7397543">I might mention, I said that the 1935 statute differed -- it -- from the 1958 grandfather statute in this material way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.023" offset="7439444">The 1935 statute which is quoted at page 20 of our brief required only that the carrier be in bona fide operation as a common carrier over roots and within the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.422" offset="7501093">The statute which this Court is asked to interpret in this case, the 1958 statute makes -- which is quoted at page 38 of the brief says, "In bona fide operation, and I'm skipping some of the words, in the transportation of property over roots and within territories."</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.515" offset="7581445">So this grandfather clause makes specific reference to the transportation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.938" offset="7603075">Indeed it might be suggested that under the 35 law, the -- a common carrier could have gotten authority to transport any commodity because the statute, at least the grandfather provision didn't refer to the property being carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.444" offset="7661171">It only required being in operation as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.893" offset="7682905">The Court found the necessity for limitations on the property carried in the definition of what a common carrier was, which was in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.194" offset="7728149">We think it is equally plain Your Honors, that the Commission properly drew a line on January 1, 1957 to exclude evidence prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.972" offset="7775274">This is precisely the type of reasonable, administrative ruling that the Congress left to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.337" offset="7804740">The Congress said that the carrier must be in bona fide operation on May 1, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.252" offset="7832430">And since that time, it left to the Commission the period of operations prior to May 1 to consider is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.752" offset="7866389">Consider the problem -- the administrative problem, there were some 900 applications for grandfather authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.696" offset="7898154">Shaw was one of those applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.769" offset="7910484">Shaw submitted to the Commission in its table, Exhibit 22, 5000 shipments running from May 1954 to October 1957, asked the Commission to consider all of these shipments and to tailor its grandfather authority accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.705" offset="7994180">If every one of the other 900 carriers submitted a similar number of shipments over a similar length of time, we're talking about 5 million shipments from various points to various subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.468" offset="8045275">The Commission in its rule of law in this case said only that we will look at your evidence back to January 1, 1957, and we will consider that evidence relevant of the scope of your operations on May 1, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.918" offset="8115075">If you wish us to consider evidence prior to May 1, 1957, you must show by substantial evidence that it is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.069" offset="8151646">In a review of the record indicates that although there was a -- there is statements by Shaw that locations of food processing or frozen fruit processing stations vary and moved around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.211" offset="8216221">There was no indication that we found in looking at the prior evidence that the Commission in considering evidence from January 1, 1957 to May 1, 1958, didn't get a fully representative picture of what this carriers operations were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.876" offset="8286856">We reviewed in Appendix C of our brief this prior evidence which the Commission did not take into consideration, and it shows that review that a representative picture was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.206" offset="8340146">Indeed, the statute says that in operations after the grandfather date, there must be uninterrupted operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.029" offset="8383509">And the Commission has, I think, reasonably looked to a certain period of time prior to the grandfather date and said, "If your operations do not come through loud and clear in that 16 month period, well then your -- your operations have a gap and you will either got to explain to us why they're not shown in the 16 month period prior to the date or we won't consider them."</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.306" offset="8488626">And indeed the Commission has considered in the cases operations more remote in 16 months, one case, Albert Getty, which was cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.105" offset="8523839">The president of the carrier had been in an -- in an accident and had -- and had to terminate some of its operations on -- on recovery and also on getting financially rearranged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.188" offset="8568142">And where that was shown, the Commission looked at a -- at more ancient history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.209" offset="8592175">But where such a substantial showing isn't made and we don't believe that it's made here, why 16 months is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.566" offset="8625612">Indeed, in the Alton case before this Court, that was a 17 month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.368" offset="8644838">The Alton case was involving the 1935 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.221" offset="8668244">Mentioning just briefly the question which is raised here on frozen fish and mixed clothes, the complaint, as we understand the brief, is that the Commissions tailoring of the authority would preclude this type of operation picking up the fish at a seaport, moving it inland and mixing -- mixing the fish with the frozen foods or berries at an inland point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.526" offset="8777435">I'm authorized to say by the Commission that the authority granted, which was set out at page 7 of the brief, that the authority granted and the Commission's judgment does not preclude that type of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.250" offset="8840338">And if the -- of course if the carrier is in doubt as to whether the operation of mixing it an inland point under this authority is precluded, why it may still ask the Commission to reopen the grandfather proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.822" offset="8890702">I'm advised that the grandfather proceedings back under the 1935 statute are still being reopened so that --</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.051" offset="9087561">There's only one or two points that I'd like to make, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.877" offset="9102921">First, I'm rather surprised by the argument that there's something different about the 1958 statute than the 1935 statutes because it mentioned the word "property".</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.136" offset="9147956">I want to point out to the Court that in 1935, Congress was dealing with -- in placing regulation on all motor carrier transportations including the transportation of passengers as well as property, and therefore, there was no occasion to do -- to say anything about property, passengers, or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.884" offset="9230921">In the statute in 1958, Congress was solely concerned, was returning to regulation as the -- as the Committee put it, the transportation of certain property and therefore, it appropriately used as a -- the word property, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.415" offset="9309080">It's -- it's the only way in which Congress could have written the statute in the same terms as the 1935 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.141" offset="9335933">Also, there seems to be some suggestion that because Congress used the words frozen fruits, frozen berries, frozen vegetables, and on that this -- this enables the Commission to create what is called three classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.770" offset="9402493">There's not one single word by anybody that testified before Congress suggesting that anyone in the industry either those who produce this, those who ship these products, those who receive them, or those who transported them considered them as three separate kinds of classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.487" offset="9473337">And the -- and the argument about wool, noils and hemp goes a little too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.811" offset="9494653">If the -- if the Court would just look at the statute, you'll see the all sale -- said wool waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.030" offset="9519522">I suppose that now we'll have a classification of wool, noils, and tops, but wool waste is a separate classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.368" offset="9552854">The fact of the matter is that the transportation of these frozen items had precisely the same transportation characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.450" offset="9597158">They were -- and that is the controlling matter in transportation, we're transported in the same kinds of vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.755" offset="9626415">They had to be equipped with the -- for the same kinds of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.717" offset="9642193">That's what makes these commodities different than wool or coco beans, or bananas, and the other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.658" offset="9673958">Now, finally, it is said that because somehow there is these limited commodities that that justifies the Commission in being more restricted in its treatment of an applicant than they were in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.934" offset="9735084">They've forgotten that the Court in Carolina pointed out very properly of basic economic fact to the transportation industry particularly for a trucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.912" offset="9778970">When you have a limited number of commodity, you must have a broad territory upon which to base an economically viable operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.553" offset="9817631">And the Court said there is in Carolina no statutory sanction for limiting point-to-point where you have a limited group of commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.611" offset="9853785">Now, as to whether they can survive, as to whether or not this is an economically viable operation, it's true, he became a substantial operator, but he didn't become a substantial operator by rever -- running his trucks in the reversed direction in going west bound in order to make east bound movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.569" offset="9933615">No one could survive in the transportation industry doing that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.376" offset="9952841">And I gather that at last before this Court, the Commission has prepared as they did an argument apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.470" offset="9977292">They suggested that it's not what they really intended, but that is what they did, and that is what they did with respect to the fragmenting of the commodities too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.503" offset="10021386">There is no justification for saying that a man can go to Chicago with frozen berries and he can go to Detroit with frozen vegetables from precisely the same origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.124" offset="10059839">No one would operate a truck line that way and no one would survive, they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.782" offset="10078542">This judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.604" offset="10085752">Thank you.</text>
