            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 79, 2,872.88 Acres of Land, etcetera, et al., Petitioner, versus United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Forrest L. Champion, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="34.707" offset="242186">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.445" offset="261204">I approach this argument with a keenly felt sense of humility, recognizing that despite any exhausting effort to study the law with respect to the issues involved in this case, one can never know it all and while I may seem categorical or firm in my position, nevertheless, I recognize the right to a difference of opinion and a difference in the construction of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.385" offset="368933">I approach it also with a keenly felt sense of pride that this Court considered the issues involved in our petition for certiorari of sufficient import to justify its consideration.Most cases are decided upon their facts but this case is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.804" offset="438627">It depends, we submit, upon the interpretation of the federal rules of civil procedure and we respectfully submit the integrity of the federal rules of civil procedure are at stake particularly, Rules 46, 51, 52, 53 7 -- and 71A (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="107.337" offset="532668">The last three rules are specifically involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.341" offset="544684">Rules 46, 51 and 61, I omitted to state that one, are incidentally involved if we construe the rules together, following the analogy of the doctrine of pari materia.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.853" offset="602781">As we see it, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were -- were a tremendous advance in the promotion of the expeditious trial of cases upon their merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.554" offset="653563">And that's the reason why we say that Rules 46, 51 and 61 are involved -- incidentally involved because they reflect the rationale behind the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.532" offset="713540">It is a maxim of the common law that -- that which I can't quote for Latin but I can say that it is a maxim that is well-recognized and that is, it is in the interest of the public that there'd be an end to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.792" offset="770591">In other words, the person is entitled to a trial in court of fair trial of his issues but he is not entitled to continue to carry on litigation when he has an opportunity to make exceptions and apprise the trial court of the position which he takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.047" offset="843525">The law requires -- due process requires that he let the trial court know with the first opportune time, what position he takes with respect to a particular matter, so that the trial court can determine the merit of his position and that has particular application here because under Rule 53 (e) (2), the objector to the findings of fact, may file objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.983" offset="967346">And the only difference in our position between the Government and us is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.828" offset="986676">We maintain that those objections must be specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.674" offset="1006111">The Government agrees that while Rule 53 (e) (2) reads may and seems to be permissive that it is in fact, mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.165" offset="1040071">We think that the better reason authority support that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.383" offset="1056893">Our only difference in opinion or position is that they say, it may -- the objections maybe general, we say they must be specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.533" offset="1093465">They must be sufficiently specific to apprise the trial court of the position taken at that time, so that the trial court, if it deems the findings of fact inadequate in any particular respect, can immediately remand it and the Commission can make findings of fact and then the trial court can review the Commission's findings in the light of the additional findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.196" offset="1192208">We say the findings of fact in this case are so utterly general as to raise no question for review and that question is tremendously important.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.860" offset="1234840">That, however, is a procedural question under Rule 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.204" offset="1252185">The other question that is involved is what is a fact under Rule 52?</text>
            <text syncTime="293.224" offset="1276217">The Government takes the position that it is necessary in making a finding of fact that a master state what evidence he credited and what evidence he dis -- discredited.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.927" offset="1323029">And the Fifth Circuit went along with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.948" offset="1335150">Indeed, that is the crux of the Fifth Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.035" offset="1355525">Even though at the same term of court, the Fifth Circuit rendered a -- a decision which reads to our way of thinking that altogether differently, cannot be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.588" offset="1421772">It is our opinion that it cannot be reconciled and I -- I don't want to be inaccurate in this respect and I -- I therefore, ask the Court's leave to quote it, in order that I might be accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.091" offset="1475688">It's a very short quotation and since it was decided by the Fifth Circuit at the same term of court and is so utterly inconsistent with the position taken in this decision appeal from that I read, "Where the only issue on appeal was one of fact and the reviewing court could not determine that the judgment of the trial court approving the findings of a special master were clearly erroneous, judgment would be affirmed."</text>
            <text syncTime="372.668" offset="1594075">That, we submit to you cannot be reconciled with the decision in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.094" offset="1615705">But yet, aside from that, there were numerous other decisions of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals already existent at the time this appeal was held, which decisions the -- the Fifth Circuit in this opinion, studiously avoid, for instance, they studiously avoided the decision of the Fifth Circuit in U.S. versus Tampa Bay Garden of condemnation case, wherein this -- the Fifth Circuit had previously held, we do not think it necessary that we require, in applying the clearly erroneous doctrine, a special finding of fact with reference to each evidentiary conflict in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.820" offset="1770663">Now, taking the Government's position to its logical extreme, it would mean that a master would have to take each witness and take each bit of testimony to which he testified and make a finding with reference to that and say, "I believe this, I disbelieve this, I believe this 50%."</text>
            <text syncTime="435.814" offset="1846627">And the logical extreme, we submit, reduces Rule 53 (e) (2) and Rule 71A (h) to an absurdity, destroys the utility of commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.885" offset="1890931">And whether we like the commissions or not, it is a part whether the Court likes commissions or not, whether a litigant likes the commissions or not, it is part of our federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.932" offset="1935130">And there is in fact, no distinction between a finding -- a report by a master, adopted by the trial judge and a jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.391" offset="1992913">In a distinction, we submit, particularly as applied to this case, is one without a difference because if the Court will look at the extensive instructions to the Commission in this case, commencing at page 18, outlining all of the basic principles of law to the Commission and even instructing the Commission that if they desired any further instructions with reference to any question that might come up before them, they could apply for -- further instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.867" offset="2118823">There were no exceptions to these instructions by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.731" offset="2134288">There were no exceptions to the reference to a commission by the Government, in fact, both parties asked for a jury trial in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.255" offset="2168351">And I respect -- respectfully submit to the Court that the question of reference to a commission was not involved in the case at all, even though the opinion of the Fifth Circuit laid us tremendously to try to justify its opinion, referring to its prosecutors against the use of a commission in a condemnation case and it was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.969" offset="2263228">Again, the opinion seeks to assert, impliedly asserts that a master must find qualifications of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.325" offset="2300635">Now, we respectfully submit that qualification of witnesses is not a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.681" offset="2322056">It is a preliminary question addressed to the fact finder.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.060" offset="2343581">One other thing that we would like to -- for this Court to clearly understand and that is this, these -- these commissions are not just referred -- they're just not picked out of thin air, they were -- they were referred to as this -- the order appointing the Commission in this case, shows they were referred to people of -- of tremendous ability that -- the -- the order of the reference says that he is an experienced attorney talking about the Chairman of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.938" offset="2471163">He was in fact, a retired superior court judge, a professor of law at Mercy University.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.147" offset="2491956">The other man -- one of the other men that constituted the member of the Commission was a real estate appraiser from Columbus, Georgia and the other member of the Commission was a gentleman from Albany, Georgia that was widely familiar with land values in this particular vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.687" offset="2558098">So we maintain, respectfully, that once the trial court affirms the findings of a master, that it has the same dignity as a jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.356" offset="2608776">But now, let's go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.053" offset="2619538">Look at the reports of the Commission made in this -- this case, in all three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.839" offset="2642735">Indeed, the report of the Commissioners in the Lindsay case is found at page 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.828" offset="2674709">What findings were made?</text>
            <text syncTime="645.856" offset="2686830">They first determined the highest and best use of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.124" offset="2707832">They next determined that he was not entitled to severance damage to his home place which was located some 5 miles from the property that was condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.546" offset="2753599">They determined the value of the land taken in fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.586" offset="2769690">They determined the value of the (Inaudible) upon the land not taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.086" offset="2787767">They determined severance damage to the land not taken and then they concluded that the landowner was entitled to the sum total of those specific items and they concluded in that conclusion of law that the fair market value of land governed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.083" offset="2859656">Now, what else could they have found, unless they took each witness and said, "I believe this witness, I disbelieve this witness"</text>
            <text syncTime="696.970" offset="2891212">Now, there maybe some complaint and in all candor, I must take to the Court that there were some comparable sales introduced but they were introduced for different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.165" offset="2944084">The Government into introducing comparable sales, introduced sales not as independent evidence of value but as a means of buttressing that expert's opinion and the distinction between introducing evidence as a basis for an expert's opinion using hearsay and -- introducing evidence of comparable sales as independent evidence of value has been recognized as vital because one stands on his own, the other one is only as a basis of the expert's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.932" offset="3079084">Looking at the end result, in all three of these cases, as the Ninth Circuit stated in U.S. versus Lewis upon which the Fifth Circuit placed his reliance but we submit very improperly so, looking at the end result in this case, you can only conclude one thing and that is that the Commission rejected the Government's witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.993" offset="3171349">They did not answer it except any particular witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.900" offset="3187022">They arrived at their own independent impression of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.555" offset="3201546">They had a right to do so under the instructions given to them by the Court because the Court specifically instructed them, "You are not bound by any particular witness nor any bit of evidence".</text>

            <text syncTime="881.078" offset="3627656">But this decision completely ignores it.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.078" offset="3639672">Applying that principle of law to these cases and looking at the actual findings and if the Court will allow me, I will go into the actual testimony in each of the cases and what the Commission found.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.131" offset="3703933">In the Gavin case, the range of testimony as to the 865 acres of upland was $60 to $85.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.930" offset="3747088">As to the 435 acres of river land, it was $83 to $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.901" offset="3771016">The Government's testimony as to each of these was $35 per acre and $50 respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.591" offset="3801736">The Commission returned an average of $81 per acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.081" offset="3823679">The Commission awarded $4480 severance damage to 200 acres which had been split up into four tracks by which of the taking which was well within the range of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.352" offset="3888776">We introduced five comparable sales as independent evidence of value ranging between $75 and $111 or an average of 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.025" offset="3927437">The Commission's finding recall was 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.534" offset="3945514">Now, if we apply the rule of an inference, if inferences maybe drawn from the facts found, we can only conclude that the Commission gave credit to the -- all of that -- testimony including the comparable sales which were introduced as independent evidence of value making adjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.055" offset="4035584">Now, the comparable sales are not ultimate facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.811" offset="4050631">They are evidentiary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.535" offset="4057527">They are introduced to persuade the fact finder that this land is worth so much because this particular track of land which was similar to this instant track sold within an approximate time for a certain amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.020" offset="4127431">But can the replies that we recognize that sales of land, no two pieces of land are alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.894" offset="4154911">And it is up to the fact finder in much the same fashion that he weighs opinion evidence to make the numerous adjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.682" offset="4186049">Now, if we -- if we infer from the facts found or the end result as found in this case, we will conclude, one, that they rejected the Government's witnesses because instead of returning an average of $43, they returned $81 per acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.276" offset="4268492">We will conclude also that they gave credence to the evidentiary comparable sales introduced because they returned $81 per acre and the average of the comparable sales introduced was $86 per acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.999" offset="4339336">You can follow that same reasoning as applied to each one of these cases and conclude if we follow the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in U.S. versus Lewis that the Commission arrived at its own independent examination of value in the light of their visit to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.172" offset="4416031">And the visit, the light of their visit to the land is something that is given tremendous significance by the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.654" offset="4449991">I have been interested in following the cases since this decision of the Fifth Circuit to see if I could find any case which went to this extreme of saying that you must state what evidence in words, what evidence you believe and what evidence you disbelieve in order to comply with Rule 52 and 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.137" offset="4535881">I have found no case to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.831" offset="4550719">I have found several cases aside from U.S. versus Lewis stating that you do not have to go that far and it was very interesting to note the decision of the Ninth Circuit just recently published in Lange versus Liberty National 324 F.2d 237 wherein the Ninth Circuit said this that not only is that not required under the amended of Rule 52 (a) requiring findings of fact but that it would have been improper to have so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.135" offset="4683943">Now, we respectfully submit to the court that just plain sensitivity to propriety does prohibits the requirement that a fact finder stated in his findings of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.823" offset="4854680">Now, in that case, the Court said, "It would have been improper for the trial court to recite the evidence which had led it to the conclusion," referring to the Petterson Lighterage &amp; Towing Corporation case which is the chief case referred to in the Advisory Committee note under Rule 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.867" offset="4958856">And that is the reason why we so earnestly submit that it is not just a matter whether this Court affirms or reverses this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.920" offset="4999084">It is a question of the eroding effect of the decision of the Fifth Circuit upon the -- the uniform application and interpretation of these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.840" offset="5042761">And I submit to you -- the Court that if it will read as we have sought to our brief, each of the cases referred to in the Advisory Committee note under Rule 52 (a) that it will find no case that goes to this extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.430" offset="5109112">Indeed, the emphasis is on conciseness ultimate facts rather than on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.407" offset="5156968">And also it seems to us that the law does not require a useless thing where you can determine from the in result as found what was credited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.223" offset="5216214">A court does not have to come out and say, "I didn't believe this witness because he was evasive on the stand."</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.117" offset="5247875">Now, recall this too, when the trial judge in this case reviewed this matter, he had not only the detailed findings of the fact and the recital in the findings of fact that we determined the value to be from the evidence as a whole, they stated it in words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.697" offset="5342124">Now, if they determine this to be value from the evidence as a whole, they -- the only logical inference that you can draw from that finding is that they didn't particularly discredit or any particular witness, they didn't conclude that any particular witness was lying because after all really, only opinion evidence is involved and everyone is entitled to an opinion particularly and there -- there is very little required in -- very little that is necessary to qualify a witness to testify the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.320" offset="5500635">Indeed, the law recognizes that a farmer is an expert as to farmland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.717" offset="5522265">And of course, in these cases, these awards did exceed the expert witnesses' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.969" offset="5551208">But it is also remarkable that the Fifth Circuit, since this decision was rendered, stated categorically that not only is it not error and it -- no deprivation of due process but that the failure to follow advice of experts is neither perceived denial of constitutional rights nor even error which maybe corrected on direct review and neither military or civil case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.715" offset="6702268">And it was multiple -- little times on it and it was inaccessible also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.520" offset="6729435">There is one other thing that I beg the Court to leave to -- to distinguish and that is the reliance of the Government upon these appeals from administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.416" offset="6773008">And I say to you -- the Court that we think we detect a distinction between the review of -- of cases wherein injunction was granted because Rule 52 expressly requires that you state the grounds of your decision where the extraordinary relief of injunction is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.921" offset="6855032">Likewise on the Rule 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, it says not only findings but the reason then basis therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.380" offset="6884916">And -- and there are two -- there are good reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.518" offset="6925458">One is, and it was clearly enunciated by this Court in the Burlington case decided at the last term, one is that Congress vested in the administrative agency that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.550" offset="6949595">And in that particular case, a choice between two definite remedies was involved not a choice as between believing two sets of witnesses as to the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.554" offset="6989615">So, naturally is -- more detailed findings were necessary but this Court was also jealous of the fact that it did not encroach upon the prerogative of the administrative agency to decide and exercise that discretion as vested in it in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.731" offset="7054294">So you've got -- but there is one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.026" offset="7071431">Due process is inherent in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.676" offset="7090030">Due process is not necessarily inherent in the administrative hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.648" offset="7113958">And it is the province of this Court and this Court had jealously regarded the right to see that due process was done in administrative agencies so as to maintain the integrity of our Government and to maintain the -- the object of the congressional legislations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.957" offset="7295248">Well, this, that I think I detect a requirement in the decisions that findings be more detailed and with quite a bit degree of collaboration in findings made by administrative agencies as compared with a master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.020" offset="7355434">I don't think that the findings of a master need to be as detailed because Rule 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act expressly requires a detailing of the reasons and bases therefore whereas Rule 53 (e) (2) says that the finding shall be made only if required in the order of reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.055" offset="7443623">And in this case, the trial judge did require findings but he did not detail the nature of the findings to be required, to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.343" offset="7488763">And it would have been a simple matter for the Government to have state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.264" offset="7508407">Now, you haven't made sufficient findings as to these evidentiary sales and the judge could have referred the thing back to the Commission immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.917" offset="7555009">These findings could have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.737" offset="7562324">We could have had a review, but it's not necessary that all of this detail be found in order for the appellate court to apply the clearly erroneous doctrine because prior decisions had said that it is only necessary that we check the general processes of the court below in order to determine if a mistake had been made, if there had been a clear misapprehension of the rule of law applied or the other usual rules that are accepted in determining that a decision is clearly erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.198" offset="7780185">The United States joined in a request that certiorari be granted in this case and we did so because the opinion of the Fifth Circuit is in a valid conflict with the opinion of the Tenth Circuit in the Merz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.435" offset="7845073">Position of the United States is that the Fifth Circuit is eminently correct and that it is the Merz decision that's erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.512" offset="7881435">These cases reflect that the lower courts have founded the bet in regard to the use of Federal Rule 71A (h) Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.395" offset="7932949">This is not surprising because jury trial is the rule, albeit, too often ignored and the use of the Commission is an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.784" offset="7982477">Now, at the time the rule was enacted, some 46 out of the present 50 States provided for a jury trial either de novo from the viewers or the land Commissioners' report or at some stage on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.760" offset="8058441">But the rule changed that and got away from the -- that double procedure that it had been in effect even the -- the previous federal experience with the TVA where the Commission would render award then either party could have a trial de novo by three judges or on appeal, the Court of Appeals could treat it de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.866" offset="8182888">But the federal rule got away from that and made the Commission, the judicial tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.205" offset="8220191">Now, the fact that a number of the District Courts have allowed the exception to devour the rule, we think really just points out the need for careful and full report by the Commission, to show what it has done.</text>
