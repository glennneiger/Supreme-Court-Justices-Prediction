            <text syncTime="40.205" offset="264234">But I referred to the lease this morning as covering an area since in here all the way down here.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.506" offset="469347">Now, we do not agree that that is the exact location with reference to its boundary, the boundary of the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.489" offset="689298">The reference to the leasing of this area was Louisiana as the owner of the naval flow waterbeds throughout the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.447" offset="733184">Then the lease Carter Oil Company on May 10th, 1948, it covered a large area as I have indicated here of the Mississippi River but particularly the area on which this producing well is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.928" offset="807058">In here, annual rentals were paid until drilling again.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.025" offset="823463">You see the annual drilling was the cause of cessation of the annual rental payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.369" offset="844884">And having security permit to drill from the Louisiana Department of Conservation, a well was putted in on March the 2nd, 1954 at a site on the west bank of the river and in direction with drill.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.450" offset="921161">Of course, that is necessary on account of the fact they can't drill in this if the river does not permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.482" offset="945298">And at a point which at that time and since, as far as I can think it go, the well is on the -- it was bottom under the river on the Louisiana side of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.202" offset="1008201">The well was completed as an oil producer on April 27th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.460" offset="1033174">Carter and Humble -- now reported Carter Oil Company and Humble Oil and Refining Company merged on December the 1st, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.612" offset="1069850">And from that time forward until the present time, Humble owns the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.519" offset="1089494">All royalties were paid to the State of Louisiana from production as one-eighth on oil and gas and other liquid hydrocarbons until February 1st, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.873" offset="1150830">The suspension went into effect at that time for one expressed reason and one only.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.341" offset="1184684">And that was the filing of the Zuccaros case down in the Federal District Court in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.324" offset="1212688">Humble simply quit paying the state royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.951" offset="1235153">Now, that is the condition of the -- in the history of the leasing in this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.543" offset="1269530">Now, throughout -- this is not the only well in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.320" offset="1288652">It's only one in the stream here in this particular area of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.057" offset="1303594">Now, this in production all around in this area here someday have been some dry oil, some producing oil wells, some producing gas well.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.690" offset="1338180">So it's not -- it's not located simply in an area that just has one well, but it just happens to be that this one well is there in exact disputed territory between Mississippi and Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.885" offset="1898872">Now, turning to the question of a justiciable controversy, Mississippi and its opposition had referred us to a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.876" offset="1962924">We refer to them, ourselves, as being -- some of them as being requiring review test those other small labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.962" offset="2003257">For instance, we have cases here in which -- in Arkansas versus Texas which says that the Court go out of reaches behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.036" offset="2063548">It's behind the nature of the controversy and beyond its palm to find out the State's reapportionment in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.420" offset="2097089">And then we have another case, an old case of -- of Connecticut versus Massachusetts which says that the Supreme Court will not exert power to control conduct of one State at two of another unless threaten invasion of rights is serious and clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.605" offset="2169814">Then the case of Texas versus Florida, we have an alternative proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.029" offset="2191444">Either the complaining State must have received some harm or injury from the other State or there must be a right, a substantial right involved that is in jeopardy and a right that could be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.400" offset="2252988">But the point that I wish to emphasize on Court is after reading these actions on original boundaries in this Court, I don't find any harm or injury mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.662" offset="2358000">You don't have to go as far as the -- this Court acted very quickly at one time and saving that these two States against almost to all conflict back in 1901.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.034" offset="2411499">There were case in 201, 202 Louisiana 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.185" offset="2432084">But now, one or two of the cases I mentioned now I have taken party in this scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.970" offset="2463222">We have a bill of complaint here in the last case between Mississippi and Louisiana decided by this Court in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.097" offset="2499793">I have before me the complaint, the bill of complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.293" offset="2528528">At bill of complaints says just about this, that a controversy has risen in the complainant, State of Mississippi and the said State of Louisiana that a few portion of the borderline between the two States that no agreement has been reached and can be reached so we are having to invoke the original-jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.167" offset="2620061">Now, we are trying to say that all of these harm and injury and of all of this acuteness, these behemoths between the States very severe pressure in the regulatory power simply is not required in this boundary actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.947" offset="2687143">Now, you take the case hereof Mississippi versus Louisiana which is decided in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.728" offset="2718281">There this Court said the record sustains the Master's finding that there is no proof that Louisiana or its citizens knew of or every east in any purported dominion of Mississippi over the disputed territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.688" offset="2786095">And it went on -- and the Court went on to say that the first knowledge of the complainant's witnesses knew anything about the dispute, derivable action was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.735" offset="2826324">Now, in this case, Mississippi there is not saying that a boundary does not -- that a dispute does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.399" offset="2877001">It simply says that this is not justiciable enough to burden this Court with it or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.803" offset="2914617">Well, if -- if a controversy is justiciable and that the boundaries in dispute, I don't see where you can drive and decide on the weight of the controversy in deciding whether or not the jurisdiction held this Court should be exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.001" offset="3219414">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.670" offset="3226102">I think my colleague has illustrated them in the first 30 minutes that a conflict actually does exist between the State of Louisiana and the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.003" offset="3271346">And this is the only form that can finally determine the controversy been in exist between the two States.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.771" offset="3314500">We feel that there is considerably more involved in this suit from the fact that we have just lost our royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.109" offset="3351803">Mississippi seems to infer in her brief that this is a very unimportant thing and that said she is not exercising her regulatory powers of this term that there's really no controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.425" offset="3405093">But when you stop to think about it, of course, this well has produced to date almost a million dollars worth of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.430" offset="3437066">It's still producing and we hope that it will continue to produce for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.219" offset="3456293">But that's not the -- the sole issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.085" offset="3463711">There are many other wells located in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.041" offset="3479489">Now, as my colleague pointed out prior to this avulsion, prior to the cut being made by the United States engineers at Glasscock, the current in the Mississippi River was flowing east to the bank of Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.434" offset="3545109">That meant that erosion, if left, the natural processes would've continued to move east and we would've been cutting farther and farther into the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.181" offset="3588054">The United States engineers in making this cut and I may point out here that when we are referred to our Master that we can prove and will rely on the fact (Inaudible) one of the earliest cuts made by the engineers that they didn't know quite is much about the subject as they do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.593" offset="3665795">And by mistake, that cut was made in such a way that you -- part of the current, instead of being directed towards Mississippi, it now bounces all towards the Louisiana bank and we know that that thalweg will continue to move westward.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.626" offset="3729847">So, we have other areas, other wells affected in this suit of the companies and we believe that all of these things are at issue and cannot be decided unless this Court takes jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.887" offset="3802885">That is probably the preferred definition by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.861" offset="3818768">Also, there had been many definitions about thalweg in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.654" offset="3841964">We readily admit that the thalweg is usually the boundary as East Mississippi's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.379" offset="3876864">And if you will leave to nature that thalweg would be the boundary, the middle in the main channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.099" offset="3907793">But in an avulsive situation, the opposite is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.854" offset="3922840">If this is an avulsion, this Court has said time and time again that the boundary is the thalweg as it existed immediately prior to the avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.847" offset="3970800">And so we feel, therefore, that this movement to the west does not affect their boundary, it cannot affect their boundary and that we have a controversy before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.817" offset="4018657">Now, Louisiana and Mississippi are the real parties and the interest in this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.148" offset="4047914">Louisiana's claim here is both proprietary and governmental in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.263" offset="4072469">As my colleague stated under Louisiana law, the State owns all navigable waterbeds to its boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.392" offset="4108936">Mississippi, the riparian owner owns rather than the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.867" offset="4130879">Our State is entitled to all royalties that are payable from wells that are located on the beds of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.596" offset="4165778">And until the Zuccaros has filed this suit, we were receiving those royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.196" offset="4188139">Then about three months prior to the filing of the complaint, before this Honorable Court, on the law of cease paying our royalties because of the cloud that had been cast on our title by the Zuccaros.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.484" offset="4245295">Now, in addition to this proprietary claim of -- of Louisiana, we are also acting in a sovereign capacity in regulating this territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.285" offset="4304541">The State of Louisiana issued the permit to drill this well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.791" offset="4322513">The State of Louisiana granted this lease to Humble Oil and Refining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.368" offset="4344874">The State of Louisiana set the allowable on this well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.746" offset="4362324">We have exercised all police powers, the -- the exercise up until the filing of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.142" offset="4395969">Now, we also have exercised our sovereign capacity of collecting all taxes such as severance taxes and ad valorem taxes on the property involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.740" offset="5406281">We feel that certainly Humble would sue us for back raw offense, for back severance taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.733" offset="5430314">They would destroy the unit because if this land is in Mississippi, Louisiana had no authority to sell a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.148" offset="5459989">What about the money that they paid us as a lease bonus when they purchased this lease, the rentals that they pay prior to drilling the well?</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.447" offset="5493112">They're just a multiplicity of problems involved in this thing in the mere assertion of jurisdiction is immaterial, I think, to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.629" offset="5533863">Now, the very fact that the State of Mississippi is here acting jointly with the Zuccaros evidence is their interest in this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.173" offset="5580048">They are here primarily in a capacity of parens patriae.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.976" offset="5599274">As you pointed out in Kentucky versus Indiana, the appropriate appearance here of a State by its proper officers either as a complainant or defendant is conclusive on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.386" offset="5664893">Now, Mississippi takes the position that this is a private controversy between the Zuccaros and Humble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.492" offset="5693315">Nothing could be further from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.295" offset="5704600">They state even further that we're appearing here on behalf of Humble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.819" offset="5722676">Louisiana's interest in this matter is that of lessor to lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.545" offset="5745560">We have an additional interest in that these royalties ceased being paid to us as I pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.359" offset="5776802">I pointed out some of the consequences that would occur in the event that the Zuccaros either win or do not win their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.712" offset="5814209">We're going to have suits regardless of the outcome of this district -- of this Mississippi jury's verdict as to the ownership of this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.506" offset="5857364">And only last week, it's seem conclusive to us that when this Court rule in the case of Durfee versus Duke that you clearly saw the multiplicity of suits that could arise if you simply allow this Mississippi jury to go ahead and reach it's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.962" offset="5931238">Here, you have a situation where a question of ownership was tried completely through the State of Nebraska, all of its courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.480" offset="5969272">Then, you started out in the Missouri courts and it was removed to the Federal District Court in Missouri, came up completely through the court system to the United States Supreme Court at which time you pointed out only last week that had anyone come up here and asked for original-jurisdiction if the battle would have been settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.792" offset="6062582">That is what we are trying to avoid, gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.306" offset="6072613">There is no way to settle this case unless we are here on a matter of original-jurisdiction and that is -- that is why we are here now in order to cut out this vexatious, the multiplicity of suits that are possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.917" offset="6143039">I believe that we have stated the cause of action in our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.791" offset="6166549">Now, in answer to our staple that we have stated the cause of action, Mississippi relies on two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.464" offset="6197269">One is Esso Standard Oil Company versus Jones and St. Clair County versus Lovingston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.672" offset="6226108">I have the honor to participate in the Esso Standard versus Jones case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.872" offset="6250872">I think that the case has nothing whatsoever to do with the case in controversy here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.572" offset="6281697">In Esso versus (Inaudible) -- California et al., we were dealing with the ownership of accretions in the old bend way after a cutoff had been and the river was no longer effective in the old channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.451" offset="6345226">There, we had no question whatsoever of thalweg or boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.211" offset="6368214">It was a question of whether when the pond of Mississippi was cutoff whether this body of water was a lake or whether it became a stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.218" offset="6412204">And the Louisiana Supreme Court held that as long as this body of water had (Inaudible) of its own, which it did at the time that the suit made in the stream regardless of whether that act was made by a man or nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.163" offset="6480018">And so, the second question in the suit was has this body of water silted up and became land instead of water, who owns it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.238" offset="6524322">And the Court held that the riparian owners were the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.119" offset="6539891">They reached that decision based on the Lovingston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.643" offset="6561938">But here, we have an entirely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.577" offset="6573641">We have an avulsive situation in the new channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.995" offset="6587329">In the old channel, your changes were gradual and imperceptible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.651" offset="6605928">Now, how can Mississippi contend when you take a massive drainage and start excavating land that that's gradual and imperceptible?</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.516" offset="6649396">It's simply beyond lee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.433" offset="7365151">It should be my object to show that there are really is not here alleged a permissible or legal boundary dispute that actually that's not an issue before this Court when you properly understand this situation and exactly what has here been alleged to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.070" offset="7463685">Just as Mr. Carmouche was sitting down, he says that an avulsion and he said it correctly according is an instance where the river leaves its bed and it forms a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.784" offset="7510497">We have no such situation as that here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.494" offset="7529305">We have here a case where the Mississippi River is now since 1812 has been and as far as we know, it will continue to be the boundary between the States in this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.709" offset="7586252">And if this Court is going to fix the boundary in this case which is the burying thalweg of that stream, you're going to be fixing the boundary from day to day and every other case up and down the -- well, the river is 2500 miles but there's not that much difference in the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.847" offset="7662738">I mean, for instance in -- in Louisiana -- between Louisiana and Mississippi, I asked the so-called expert to tell me the -- how much boundary there was from the 31st degree of north latitude to the 33rd which is the place of common boundary and he said that it's 198 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.503" offset="7729403">Now, I don't know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.549" offset="7733582">That's what I just told.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.215" offset="7740270">They all in that area, some cases whether been either man-made or natural avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.582" offset="7765661">Now, there was no avulsion in the Duke versus Durfee case that you're dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.145" offset="7783946">And here is what we would like us to get before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.597" offset="7801710">It's -- it's alleged in the complaint and we thought it might be of service to might give you a little map and we put one up here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.845" offset="7854791">Now, we attached to a supplemental brief which we filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.961" offset="7887182">And this is the map of -- the original of which was -- was reproduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="4330.800" offset="17426578">As we understand the issue present before the Court, it's on a motion of the State of Louisiana to file or be permitted to file a complaint, an original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.578" offset="17469733">And as we understand, we are to take that complaint as it is written and apply the law as this Court has written it to the facts as they are undisputed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4377.947" offset="17615182">We determine whether the claim is that of the State, whether the State is indeed the real party in interest.</text>
