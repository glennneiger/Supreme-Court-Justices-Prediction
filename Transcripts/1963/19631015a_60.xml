            <text syncTime="10.638" offset="145951">This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of the Florida which affirms certain criminal convictions by the criminal court of record in the -- for Dade County, Florida involving 18 appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.768" offset="210422">The adjudication by the trial court was head pursuant to Section 509.141 of the Florida Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.744" offset="250337">This chapter of this Section is set forth on page 8 of the appendix of appellants' main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.233" offset="284296">To begin with an analysis of the statute, so we'll know what the case is about, the statute is rather unwieldy piece of legislation provides in essence insofar as it is germane to this case that if any person enter a restaurant and if his presence or continued presence is, among other reasons, in the opinion of the management, thought to be detrimental to the business, then the manager may request that this patron leave the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.245" offset="416371">If the patron declines to leave, the manager may then call the police. He's telling the client to leave, he is deemed to be illegally on the premises and subject to arrest and conviction for misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.084" offset="475721">The statute also provides for certain other criteria of undesirability such as persons being intoxicated, immoral, profane, lewd or brawling, but then at the end, it has this rather generalized provision that any other person who, in the opinion of the management, is -- is -- the presence of such a person would be detrimental to the business, and that person maybe ejected from the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.799" offset="866617">I wish I had seen the point of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.650" offset="878007">We didn't raise that particular issue but they were never served any food at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.832" offset="902666">What happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.818" offset="910608">The appellants, constituting 18 persons and being both Negroes and white persons in association with Negroes, entered into a -- a department store in Miami, Florida called Shell's City.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.501" offset="961390">The Shell's City has 19 departments, one of which is a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.059" offset="983646">It serves the public, Negro and white alike, without discrimination in 18 of the departments but in the restaurant, it draws the color bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.511" offset="1021367">Prior to the incident in question, which gave rise to these criminal prosecutions, there had been two other attempted sit-in demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.188" offset="1052087">They're mentioned very briefly in the record and the consequences of them are not set forth in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.506" offset="1077373">On this particular day, which was on August of 1960, the appellants walked into the restaurant in this department store, sat down in about five tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.841" offset="1118751">They were not served when they sat down and they waited for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.332" offset="1136724">They waited for about a half-an-hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.926" offset="1151039">At the end of the half hour period, one of the appellants got up from the table, walked over to a Mr. George McKelvey.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.142" offset="1183953">Mr. McKelvey is the Vice President of Shell's City and he is also a general manager of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.141" offset="1211956">The appellant asked Mr. McKelvey could he be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.007" offset="1223450">Mr. McKelvey said, “No”.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.942" offset="1231182">The appellant said, "Why?"</text>
            <text syncTime="283.329" offset="1236720">He said, "I have nothing further to say to you."</text>
            <text syncTime="286.551" offset="1249573">At that point, the appellant went back to join the group and sat down.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.854" offset="1270784">Then Mr. McKelvey got on the phone and called -- called the police and told them what was happening in his restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.649" offset="1301922">About 10 minutes later, a policeman arrived, Sergeant John Suggs of the Miami police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.488" offset="1325328">He then, with Mr. McKelvey, walked to each of the tables and Mr. McKelvey again made his request to the appellants that they leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.126" offset="1371826">They again declined to leave whereupon Sergeant Suggs took them all into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.124" offset="1399829">Now, going back a step, while they were in the restaurant, there were other persons, white persons seated there and were being served.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.283" offset="1432534">That is clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.794" offset="1450506">The manager of the restaurant testified at the trial that the reason for his refusal of service was the fact that the appellants were Negroes or white persons in association with Negroes, and that, in his opinion, would make a detrimental to any -- longer entertain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.741" offset="1526366">So the source, the substance, the foundation of his reason for refusing to serve them was their color or their associations with persons of color.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.276" offset="1572446">There is no evidence in the record that any of the appellants were engage in any boisterous or noisy conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.472" offset="1605256">There is no evidence that they comported themselves in any fashion which would have included them in the other specific provisions of Section 509.141.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.649" offset="1646007">They were peaceful at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.490" offset="1657292">There is no evidence in the record that there was any hostile crowd gathered about the -- the group of appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.414" offset="1681011">There was no situation that would have erupted into violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.974" offset="1703267">No indication of any kind of situation such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.534" offset="1725524">The facts are essentially undisputed, the appellants put on no evidence of their own. However, cross-examining Mr. McKelvey and his associate, Mr. Warren Williams, also a vice president of Shell's City, certain additional facts were adduced, which I think should lead to a reversal of the judgments below.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.488" offset="1829282">Mr. Williams, when he was questioned, was asked why the people, why the appellants were refused service.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.726" offset="1950281">He indicated not once but on four different occasions that there was a custom in Dade County not to serve Negro and White people in the same restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.990" offset="1991346">And he indicated that -- and it said that this custom forced him to do what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.557" offset="2013602">If I may read some extracts from the record, at the top of page 29.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.219" offset="2052263">First, the question - "Do you know why these people were refused service at the restaurant?"</text>
            <text syncTime="490.991" offset="2067310">Answer - "Well, basically, it is the policy of Shell's City not to serve colored people in their restaurant."</text>

            <text syncTime="498.559" offset="2097612">Answer - "That is based upon the customs, the habits, and what we believe to be the desire of the majority of the White people in this county."</text>
            <text syncTime="510.777" offset="2146513">Again, towards the bottom of page 29 in talking about why they discriminate, Mr. Williams again answers, "Well, it goes back to what is the custom that is the tradition of what is basically observed in Dade County would be the bottom of it."</text>

            <text syncTime="1228.905" offset="5019042">The Court, in the first part of its opinion, stated that the capital transit system, because of its regulation by the Public Utilities Commission, in placing these radios and acting in the way it did, act in the governmental capacity, and that First Amendment rights or obligations were brought in to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.890" offset="5122905">The Court said that there wasn't a mere fact that there was a franchise granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.279" offset="5152475">The Court stated that this was a -- an enterprise regulated by a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.501" offset="5185390">The Court went on to say that it deemed as particular significant the fact that the transit company went to the Public Utilities Commission to get a ruling on this particular service, the radios.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.344" offset="5240769">Here, I think, if we had gone to the Florida Hotel Commission for our ruling, we would've gotten the same answer necessarily as we've got from the Florida Supreme Court, namely that restaurant owners may discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.779" offset="5302523">But the important thing about the Pollak case, it seems to me, as the Court has said that a regulated enterprise where it acts in a field of significant public importance, public transportation, takes on characteristics of state action, for there is, to use the language of the Burton case, they had interdependence between the State and the -- the private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.948" offset="5419133">A similar case was Baldwin against Morgan, a Fifth Circuit case which dealt with the terminal building in Birmingham, a railroad terminal building.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.537" offset="5741484">But even if the Court should consider it important, then it would seem that the monopoly situation would -- would lead to an absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.585" offset="5785684">If you say that a monopoly, because it's a monopoly, cannot discriminate but 100 or 1500 restaurants, because they're not monopoly, can discriminate, then you get a very strange result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.961" offset="12443251">If I may, Mr. Justice Goldberg, in answer to your question, it is by nature -- by the nature of the property that the statute breaks down into four sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.691" offset="12490167">And in the fourth, when you get to the section which says, "And any other person".</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.390" offset="12508975">Now, I would assume that in ordinary circumstances wherever you might be that these enumerated areas or acts or situations would probably provide a valid basis for anybody to act in defense of themselves, their property, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.306" offset="12584626">Now, when you get to the other, the area where it's left to the individual, it is because it is private property that they have to extend in some latitude if the only reasons you could were for those enumerated, while there wouldn't be enough paper in the world to write out all the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.444" offset="12673128">You have got to leave something to an individual as you do in ordinary trespass, as you do in the -- in other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.047" offset="12711581">If you do not, then you wind up in a hopeless mirage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.393" offset="12724955">You either -- you either enumerate beyond belief or you leave it totally without mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.190" offset="12748152">Now, I don't pretend to know why they bothered to say it the way they did in the legislature, but I assume that they had a valid reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.103" offset="12779813">And so far, of course, it hasn't been changed except by an insubstantial alteration by the '61 Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.652" offset="12813981">But it seems to me that if you don't allow some latitude for an individual to determine what, in his view, is going to be detrimental, even if it'd be this, however vague you may consider it to be, then there isn't anything that you can give him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.260" offset="12884407">If he isn't drunk, if he isn't brawling, if he isn't offensive or abusive, then theoretically, you can't put him out even if you are offended by it and even if you do know that it will be detrimental.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.883" offset="13102895">The fact is that they went there planning to do this very thing which is apart from what we're discussing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.034" offset="13127555">But now a question of whether this is a state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.868" offset="13146885">There has been the hue and cry raised that they were informed against by the office of the State Attorney, that they were sentenced by a judge of the criminal court of record, that the District Court of Appeal acted on it, that the Florida Supreme Court acted on it, and that the Attorney General is now a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.856" offset="13222745">Well, by law, we're required to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.069" offset="13239672">Any criminal action in the State of Florida as is probably true in most of the jurisdictions including the District of Columbia are brought by some prosecuting arm of the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.069" offset="13295679">I fail to see how this type of action makes it state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.857" offset="13314800">I further fail to see how Sergeant Suggs, when he arrested after a refusal to leave in the face of this legislation, was doing anything but what he was required to do as a part of his duties as a law enforcement official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.182" offset="13388152">Now, if he is given the ability, the duty, the responsibility, the choice to decide whether a given act is or isn't, then we don't need this Court or any other court, because if our police officers can decide what is a crime, then we don't need any courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.571" offset="13469654">And before too much longer, if they become proficient at it, we won't need laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.210" offset="13492224">But the point is, the legislation as it exists, at least until you have had a chance to review it and pass upon it, is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.548" offset="13525556">And we've got to presume that if you refuse to leave after you've been asked, in accordance with the statute, and this was in the presence of the police officer who asked them and even suggested that they leave before he arrested them, then have committed those acts which, if they result in a conviction, constitute the misdemeanor of which they ultimately were found guilty by the trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.239" offset="13640286">Now, custom is one thing, police action is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.463" offset="13661184">Any crime that is committed results in some type of prosecution, I would hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.635" offset="13685948">Now, admittedly, there are times when choices are made as to which way to go but that is not done by a law enforcement, that's done by a prosecution and/or the court which is the proper place for it to repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.241" offset="13748328">But it's idle to say that because all of these circumstances which led to the case finding its way here, that becomes state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.133" offset="13783855">The state did not advocate anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.081" offset="13791692">They have a statute which simply says that these people are going to be allowed to exercise the right over their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.918" offset="13819068">And therefore, anybody who flies into the face of this request, after it's been made in accordance therewith, is guilty if the -- if it results in the trial in the finding of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.331" offset="13860655">Now, there was a reluctance yesterday on the part of some people to enter into the question of whether this approaches religion, I am not so reluctant, I don't seen how you can avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.792" offset="13910497">Let us assume, if you will, that in a given ceremony in a Jewish Synagogue, you have four Catholics come in carrying crucifixes, who sit themselves in the front row.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.877" offset="13962846">This is an open and public indicia of a difference of creed, which is offensive to the Jewish populace and to the rabbi.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.190" offset="14016136">Well, I suppose he could ask them to leave, but if they decline, what could he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.975" offset="14035257">Could he force them to leave?</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.671" offset="14042049">Ask them or rather force them to get out?</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.065" offset="14051662">Could he call the police?</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.964" offset="14055215">I think he should be free to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.618" offset="14065873">Now, the difference between creed and color means absolutely nothing if you look at the constitution that assures that they are guarantees.</text>
