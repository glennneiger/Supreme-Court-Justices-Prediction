            <label>Mr. Will Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1.784" offset="110529">Just before recess, I said to this Court that both of the patents below or the patents were held invalid is being within the public domain and yet the Court following the Illinois law or what -- how it interpreted the Illinois law, found that Sears was guilty of unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.520" offset="229439">In the sale of pole lamps which were a copy of that which was in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.664" offset="266010">There was some evidence of two buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.305" offset="284609">One, a buyer from Marshall Field, one of the large department stores in Chicago and the other is Smithe Company, furniture dealers, likewise a very high grade store, that someone had seen a cut of a similar lamp in the Sears catalog, listed at some $19 plus, whereas they had bought lamps from Sears at some $40 or $39.95.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.031" offset="423476">The same was true with respect to the Smithe situation, except in that case, the complaining customer of Smithe's had seen one of the lamps in a Sears store.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.632" offset="485857">That was the sum and substance of the evidence with respect to similarity and confusion by any customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.897" offset="526921">It was ranked hearsay because the buyers were saying what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.370" offset="556805">One of the buyers from Sear -- from Marshall Field wanted to know how to explain to the customer that there was this difference between a $19 plus product and a $39 plus product.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.027" offset="615528">And we find in the record at page 91 a complete explanation by the vice president of the respondent, a Mr. Philips and I'm just going to read with the Court's permission, the third paragraph of the letter of explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.369" offset="700897">"As you know, it is common practice for many manufacturers to copy expensive designs and sell to retailers at reduced cost by reducing the quality through poorer materials and inferior labor."</text>
            <text syncTime="167.030" offset="771532">Now, the granting of the perpetual monopoly to Mr. Stiffel gives him the opportunity of continuing to maintain his $40 plus price and precludes anybody that wants to buy a product at less money that will -- will serve the same purpose, it may not be finished quite as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.377" offset="884903">But on the other hand, I think the public should be given the privilege of determining for themselves whether they want to buy a $20 item or buy a $40 item.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.368" offset="956792">The injunction states and I'm reading now from page 68 of the record, which is item 3 in the final judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.733" offset="1086255">Now to me, that means that Sears is precluded from selling a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.764" offset="1118438">Just in so many words, that's the only thing that can be unfair, if it is legally unfair, and our position is that it is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.415" offset="1213001">Now, it's my position that even if Sears put a large tag on it or a neon light sign saying, "This is manufactured by, sold as a product of Sears", so far as the wording of this injunction is concerned, the commandment of this judgment is that we cannot sell a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.407" offset="1309027">And anytime under state law that you are precluded from selling a copy, you are then stepping in to the federal patent system because you are giving to the Stiffel Company more than what they could have gotten had their design patent been valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.444" offset="1905142">Judge Learned Hand, in one of his decisions in a case where some silk material was copied, made the statement that this would be the equivalent of giving to the first to come on the market a patent right, a common law patent right, that would last forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.798" offset="1998555">Now, the State cannot do that because the federal -- under the Constitution, "Congress can determine when it gives one the right to exclude others from copying or making one confusingly similar."</text>
            <text syncTime="491.490" offset="2069295">That right was given to Congress or by -- by -- it was given by our Constitution to Congress and that has been our patent scheme for over a 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.289" offset="2124570">Now, our -- conceding for a moment that the Sears lamp sold by Sears in a Sears store and has advertised, or listed in its catalog, did not have a tag on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.109" offset="2187786">Much has been said in this case by the respondent that Sears' product was not tagged.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.292" offset="2224567">I am sure no one would want a thing of beauty that should put in your living room or in your bedroom with a nameplate put on, "Manufactured by or sold through Sears."</text>
            <text syncTime="544.363" offset="2280782">Now, it's strange in this case, the Court of Appeal -- there was no finding in the lower court that there was a tag omitted or there was no nameplate on, no finding of secondary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.089" offset="2335744">And yet our Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit took upon themselves to say, "There was no tag on the Sears pole lamp."</text>
            <text syncTime="568.948" offset="2379212">Now, I'll concede that on the pole lamp itself, there was no tag but the container in which the Sears lamp was shipped to the respondent, it had a label on it saying, "Manufactured by."</text>
            <text syncTime="587.880" offset="2454862">And yet in this particular case, respondent here says, "Sears didn't put their name on it nor the name of the manufacturer."</text>
            <text syncTime="599.718" offset="2502196">And yet on the very page that they referred to in this record, four or five lines above, the vice president of the Stiffel Company said that when he received the lamp, he knew who the manufacturer was because he took the label off of the container in which the lamp was shipped to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.295" offset="5960600">Now, the manner in which Sears moved in was to take a picture of plaintiff's -- Stiffel's pole and take it to a manufacturer in Philadelphia and have him make what was almost an exact replica of the Stiffel pole lamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.161" offset="6052028">In this structure, there are of course functional elements, the elements which make the lamps operate, the switches, the connections between the sections, the springs at the top which hold it to the ceiling.</text>
