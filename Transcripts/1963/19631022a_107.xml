            <text syncTime="26.807" offset="210631">At the outset of my portion of the argument, I would like to recall to the Court's attention that what we are dealing with here is criminal contempt, not civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.199" offset="268204">We are not looking to a procedure in the court below which has, as any of its intention, the enforcement of orders of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.122" offset="323897">These orders have been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.304" offset="336541">James Meredith has attended the University of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.238" offset="352319">He has graduated from that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.751" offset="366425">The function of judicial process in this case has run its course to completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.747" offset="402369">The possibility of frustration or nullification of that process has passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.331" offset="436746">This is criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.725" offset="446255">The species or variety of the contempt power of the court that looks to punishment, criminal punishment --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="100.970" offset="507277">Do you seek testing the case is moot?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="104.762" offset="522428">No, sir, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.806" offset="526608">Criminal contempt is a term-honored form of the contempt power.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.308" offset="556596">We are here concerned with how that power can be exercised under the constitutional safeguards of the United States of America, and the point that I make is that, while civil contempt is a procedure in which the court is seeking to have its decree enforced and to bring the parties who might be thought to be recalcitrant into compliance with this decree, this form of civil contempt has none of the procedural safeguards that this Court has been willing in the past to apply to criminal contempt and what this Court is seeking to do is to punish, is to inflict a penal sanction, is to vindicate, reek vengeance upon someone who it says it has reason to believe has, in the past, violated its decree or come across its decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.203" offset="804133">This is the point that I would make, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.231" offset="816253">On page -- well, Your Honors don't have this.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.401" offset="832972">We ask that the argument yesterday be transcribed and we were furnished last night with the copy of the transcript, and the Honorable Solicitor General points out in his argument that, in this particular situation, we are less concerned with punishment than with further compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.234" offset="920325">This causes me to want to begin at the point of urging to Your Honors that there is a very vital distinction between civil contempt which seeks to bring about compliance, which imposes a conditional sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.134" offset="987930">Just as the Court of Appeals did here when it said to the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor "now, if this order is not complied with and your compliance is not shown to this Court by the 2nd day of October, then fines of $10,000 a day and imprisonment will be imposed upon you.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.799" offset="1082598">Bring yourself out of the area of conflict with our decree."</text>
            <text syncTime="252.406" offset="1113004">This was a civil sanction for the purpose of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.555" offset="1133589">I think that they departed from the statute when they imposed both fine and imprisonment, but that's an entirely side issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.289" offset="1160547">I think they exceeded their statutory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.241" offset="1172355">But, that was civil contempt and as Your Honors pointed out in your questions to counsel opposite here yesterday, I believe it was Mr. Justice Goldberg, this civil decree was entered and after its entry, Meredith did attend the university and did graduate there from.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.849" offset="1302758">Your Honor, the criminal contempt proceedings were not commenced until an order was entered by the Court of Appeals on the November, 15, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.454" offset="1353226">At the time of the entry of this order, James Meredith was enrolled in the University of Mississippi and had been, since the 1st day of October, 45 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.450" offset="1405158">The Honorable Solicitor General also says that the constitutional phase of our argument is controlled by the decision of these Court in Green versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.931" offset="1455104">We take a contrary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.554" offset="1465553">We say that it is not controlled by the Green case for the reason that, in this situation, the Congress of the United States, at the instance of the Attorney General of the United States, passed a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.409" offset="1528978">It was part of the Criminal Code Section 1509 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.398" offset="1556982">It made that interference with court decrees by persons who were not parties to the proceedings a violation of the criminal law of the United States of America and permitted the imposition of criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.701" offset="1626154">This was not so in the Green case.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.566" offset="1637648">Bail jumping was not an offense at the time that Gilbert Green left the area of the courtroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.119" offset="1691878">If Your Honor please, the distinction that I would make to you immediately in the Shipp case, borne out from my examination of the records of the case in this Court, is that Shipp did not demand a jury, as was his constitutional right and of course, it was his constitutional prerogative to waive his right to jury which he did because the record of this Court shows that the Shipp-defendants considered to the taking of the testimony by a commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.311" offset="1812668">So, I would --</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="431.344" offset="1828760">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.717" offset="1830222">They just -- the constitutional issue which I make to Your Honors here this morning just wasn't erased.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.924" offset="1851120">Of course the defendant does not have to be accorded a trial by jury where he's willing to waive that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.272" offset="1872436">I think this is acknowledged by everyone, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.849" offset="1886751">I believe that that is the vital distinction between what we urge to Your Honor here and the Shipp case as controlling precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.088" offset="1919770">Shipp was not tried with a jury and I might say, it would be appropriate at this time to comment on the fact that the Solicitor General pointed out that, at one page in his brief, he had delineated approximately 15 cases of criminal contempt tried in the courts of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.009" offset="1991450">I have done my best to become acquainted with every one of those cases and I make the statement without any fear of contradiction to Your Honors that not single one of those cases involved the demand for a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.525" offset="2057488">There were two really comparable cases or a group of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.491" offset="2077341">One of them was not actually cited by the Solicitor General in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.794" offset="2094582">They both drew out of the matter that was here before this Court, styled in re McKenzie.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.050" offset="2123525">A receiver had been appointed in State of Alaska around the turn of the century, I believe it was in 1900 exactly, to become -- to operate certain gold claims in the State of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.578" offset="2189667">Then the Ninth Circuit granted an appeal from the order refusing to dissolve the receivership and in the course of its granting of that order by a single judge of the Court of Appeals, it issued a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.577" offset="2257690">Then, the claim was made that Mr. McKinley, the receiver had violated the stay order of the single judge of the Court of Appeals by refusing to turnover to the other defendants, in the -- the other parties in the receivership proceedings the gold dust and gold nuggets that he had possession of at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.670" offset="2354030">Out of this refusal and by the way, Mr. McKenzie had a conflict between the orders of the District Court and the orders of the Court of Appeals but, out of this situation, there grew two criminal contempt cases in the Ninth Circuit, one in which Mr. McKenzie was jailed for six months and one in which his attorney was jailed for three months for giving him the advice that the order -- the stay order did not mean that he had to turn over the gold.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.527" offset="2477432">These two cases, I say, grew out of that, but I have examined the records that are here before this Court, in your library upstairs, and there was no demand by Mr. McKenzie or by his attorney for a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.796" offset="2534588">So, again, the issue was not raised in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.958" offset="2547231">The other comparable case was In re Door, D-O-O-R.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.857" offset="2570846">This was a case in which the use of the mails to transmit obscene matter was charged in connection with an investigation by the postal department, and Door was acted upon by the Court of Appeals in the sense that he was enjoined pending the time the appeal of this case was to be tracked and they claimed that he violated -- again, the Ninth Circuit claimed that he violated that injunction that was on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.368" offset="2712848">Door did not demand a trial by jury and the opinion of the court and the Court of Appeals expressly says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.625" offset="2761853">I do not think that there has ever been a situation in which a demand for a trial by jury of an offense -- correction -- a demand for a trial by jury in a criminal contempt proceeding where the subject matter of the alleged contempt was clearly a true crime, as opposed to amounting to a crime under the common law or equal to a crime, was a true crime if proved where a demand for a constitutional trial by jury was made and refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.922" offset="2919111">I do not believe that this Court has ever had that question before and I believe that it is a question of first impression and not controlled by the Green case.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.915" offset="3059022">The other cases cited by the Solicitor General in his brief all involved appeals for administrative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.874" offset="3098833">and of course, the very first time that these matters ever reached a court of law is when they come into the Court of Appeals and of course, there is no such thing as contempt of an administrative proceeding and where NLRB or FTC enters a requirement that a person perform a certain thing or do a certain act and then an appeal is made from that and the Court of Appeals says, "Yes the order is valid now, obey it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="778.754" offset="3218369">Then the only type of contempt power that could be exercised would be a contempt of the order of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.878" offset="3250866">and this is what was involved in every other one of the proceedings cited by the Solicitor, none of which bore any evidence of a demand for a trial by jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.996" offset="3779375">Where his obstreperousness was interfering with the conduct of a trial, he would have just had him physically removed for the day and then, if he came back the next day and persisted in his conduct, he would have removed him again.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.224" offset="3828276">He would have never imposed a penal sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.886" offset="3838934">I would not go that far with Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.745" offset="3846353">I recognize that this creates a situation that could break down a trial, and the point that I would make with you above all is that what I am urging here is not anything that's going to keep a court from functioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.813" offset="3898598">What I am urging to you is that, when you impose a penal sanction in a criminal trial, it ought to be done under the Constitution of the United States by a jury procedure where the defendant demands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.144" offset="3959933">This, I think, is a simple summation of what my constitutional point is to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.810" offset="3982608">If I may, I don't want to be presumptuous to the Court but, just for emphasis, Article III Section 2 Clause 3 of the Constitution says, and of course has said since the day it was written, that the trial of all crimes, except in impeachment cases -- except in impeachment cases, shall be by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.958" offset="4075186">There's only one exception in that statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.896" offset="4086993">It's an exception of a procedure that is sui generis, if one ever was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.995" offset="4111339">I mean, the trials of impeachments are really peculiar animals under the law, but that's the only exception and I make the point with Your Honors that it's a much stronger point in my favor because the exception is there, that it would be if it had not been there, even though trials by impeachment are clearly provided for elsewhere in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.743" offset="4226382">Here, they thought it necessary to call out this right in the Savings Clause that save to the citizens the right to be tried by juries in this country for crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.789" offset="4290539">From a great dissatisfaction with the way the Constitution was originally written, the Congress, in its first meeting, put into the Constitution the Bill of Rights and here again, in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.877" offset="4354905">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.138" offset="4395969">I submit to Your Honors that they are words that leave absolutely no room for any other construction in a case such as we have here where a court is seeking vengeance, where a court seeks to punish a past act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.204" offset="4472142">I think that the Constitution very elaborately and very precisely defines exactly what my client's rights are and I think that this Court should make a holding in this case which will enforce those words of the Constitution in cases of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.914" offset="4567019">The prosecution has been able to develop absolutely no history that will support any other construction, except for the fact that, in old cases, this Court ruled that criminal contempt was not within the purview of these sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.598" offset="4677778">If Your Honors please, this is a different case from those cases even because this is a statutorily defined crime if the defendants are guilty of this act, and that issue has never been before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.575" offset="4745697">But, assuming for the sake of this argument, the validity of Terry and Debs and the other cases that have made these holdings, I say to Your Honors, the error is one of the commodities that does not improve with age and this Court, I urge with the utmost deference and respect, should recognize that older decisions which do not grant this right are error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.269" offset="4896475">The Constitution has meant different things at different times in this nation's history and yet, its words have never changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.037" offset="4947571">So, what I urge the Court to do here is not an unheard of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.694" offset="4982157">When I urge you to depart from the spirit of past decisions in the constitutional field, I'm not urging something that's never been argued to you before and I am very sure, will not be argued to you again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.710" offset="5058226">I don't think that the Constitution is a dead document and I think that this Court will constantly be asked to examine its decisions in the constitutional field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.010" offset="5107440">But, let me emphasize that I make this point only in argument because I do not concede that this case that we have here today has ever been before this Court before, and I make the point only that the spirit of other decisions which would indicate a contrary result ought not be allowed to control this case because I don't think that they are on all fours with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.316" offset="5220603">I don't think that they were the issue that we have here before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.601" offset="5249755">One bit of support comes from Mr. Madison in his original argument to the Congress for the adoption of the Bill of Rights, and I have never seen it quoted heretofore, and if I may ask Your Honors indulgence to call it to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.184" offset="5352155">He said in Congress, “In the declaration of rights which England has established, the truth is that they've gone no further than to raise a barrier against the power of the crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.683" offset="5406072">The power of the legislature is left altogether indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.856" offset="5422791">Although I know that whenever the great rights trial by jury, freedom of the press, or liberty of conscience come in question in that body, the Parliament, the invasion of them is resisted by evil advocates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.889" offset="5494888">Yet, their Magna Carta does not contain any one provision for the security of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.163" offset="5520071">Respecting which, the people of America are most alarmed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.300" offset="5544521">He included the right to a trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment in his demands for First Amendment protection and in his differentiation of the Law of England and the Law of the United States in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.204" offset="5628217">Continuing, "But, although the case may be widely different and it may not be thought necessary to provide limits for the legislative power in that country, yet, a different opinion prevails in the United States.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.212" offset="7240182">I think that this Court's holding in Griffin versus the People of Illinois clearly indicates what this Court means by due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.214" offset="7488240">On the first day, when the Government had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendants in this case were interfering, in anyway, with the orders of the District Court of the United States or of the Court of Appeals, they had the right to take the information that they filed with the Court of Appeals, and form an affidavit, and make a criminal charge against these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.607" offset="7625749">This was their prerogative and I submit to Your Honors, their only prerogative, insofar as criminal sanctions were concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.977" offset="13223267">Let me, at this juncture in the argument, if I may, make a retort or rebuttal to the Solicitor's argument of yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.005" offset="13263391">He admits that the United States had no right to participate in Meredith versus Fair on behalf of either of the private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.534" offset="13297560">But, he says, when it occurred to the Government that a violation of Section 1509 had occurred that “they,” and I quote him literally here, “accordingly, went to the Court of Appeals and there, commenced” what on page 33 of my transcript he describes as this, “a supplementary ancillary independent action."</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.397" offset="13432978">I believe that these words are self-contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.292" offset="13448547">I don't believe that you can have a supplementary, ancillary, independent action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.351" offset="13476760">If it's ancillary, it's not independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.759" offset="13486373">If it's independent, it's not ancillary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.231" offset="13504345">I would also take issue, completely and categorically, with a statement made by the Eminent Solicitor in the course of his argument that he was faced with the dilemma of a District Court which would -- which either couldn't do anything during the time of Judge Cameron's stays or, after he had been given the opportunity, it declined to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.554" offset="13641540">As I read the federal rules, and I have reference to Rule 7 (b), any time that a person moves a District Court to perform an act, it being a court of record, that motion must be made in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.372" offset="13712906">and if any article of this argument of the Solicitor is to be taken so as to prejudice the least of my client's rights, then I think that this Court is required to get the full facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.729" offset="13786258">I have here on the table a certificate from the Clerk of the District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi which says that there never was a motion filed by the United States of America for leave to intervene in the District Court of the State of the Southern District of Mississippi as amicus curiae throughout the entire history of the merited proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.758" offset="13886360">We are here on this prong of his argument contending about conversations that are completely deposed of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.903" offset="13939022">Later in his argument, he says that, at a stage in the procedure, the Court of Appeals required him to make a second entreaty to the District Court to be allowed to act in that court, and that that second entreaty was denied and that it is shown in the certified record here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.770" offset="14042467">When Mr. Jaworski replies to my argument, I would ask him to enlighten both the Court and myself as to where this second appeal occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.811" offset="14106624">The only thing that I am able to find in any part of the certificate before this Court relating to an intercession or a motion or a plea for the District Court to perform any act that it did not perform was that the Court of Appeals said that it "ascertained" that the District Court was unwilling to admit the United States into it's court as amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.489" offset="14241311">I find nothing else in the certified question, and I made the point in my brief that this matter is not in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.159" offset="14472025">and I only point out to you that if it's to have the slightest affect on the defendants rights, then I think the Court ought to get the record before it and I think the record ought to be the basis for its action because I do take firm issue with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.918" offset="14527091">The only time that Judge Mize was asked to do something by the Government in the form of written plea that he acted on, he granted the injunction against Meredith's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.955" offset="14591143">He proceeded on one-day's notice to try the Chancellor of the University, the Registrar of the University, and the Dean of the School for civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.017" offset="14639417">He did arrive in an acquittal of civil contempt that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.161" offset="14656031">But, let me point to Your Honors that those same three people were immediately taken before the Court of Appeals and charged in that court with the contempt of an identical order, and there's an order on the records of the Court of Appeals finding that those people are not in contempt and were never in contempt of the court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.977" offset="14731264">So, he's been affirmed in that action and he did not refuse to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.558" offset="14753625">He did not delay justice, and I make that in the most positive manner that I can make to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.877" offset="14782882">I have gotten too verbose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.675" offset="14810049">I think that the Court should consider the basis for the decision that it's asked to make here in this case and I think that the Court should be cognizant of the fact that, so many times, you've pointed out yourselves that this Court doesn't have the power of the sword or the purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.966" offset="14919241">The way that this Court brings about its desired results is by appealing to the minds and the hearts of men as a basis that what we say is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.054" offset="14971591">You don't just write a decree out and say “judgment for the defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.498" offset="14993324">The Court tries to say why a judgment for the defendant ought to be issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="3895.932" offset="15687137">In the few minutes that remain for argument, I should like to emphasize the points that we consider to be controlling of the answer that's to be given to the one question that was certified to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.031" offset="15759548">I went on September 10, 1962, Mr. Justice Black vacated the several stays that were granted by Judge Cameron to the mandate of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.978" offset="15815241">Mr. Justice Black further ordered, in very plain language, that the judgment and mandate of the Court of Appeals shall be effective immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.055" offset="15855574">and of course, there was added also that, pending final action by this Court on the petition for writ of certiorari, the respondents be, and they are hereby, enjoined from taking any steps to prevent enforcement of the United States Court of Appeals judgment and mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.380" offset="15936867">Bearing in mind now that there was this order that the judgment and mandate of the Court of Appeals shall be effective immediately, it was found that there were efforts to obstruct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.702" offset="16010219">It was not until eight days later, September the 18th, after these efforts to thwart became apparent that Meredith's enrolment at the University would be interfered with in every way possible, that the United States applied to the Court of Appeals for an order allowing it to appear in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.942" offset="16111156">Now, this was the act of a government that was deeply concerned about the preservation of the administration of justice and the upholding of the integrity and authority of the judicial processes of the United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.091" offset="16183777">The Court of Appeals entered the order, allowing the United States to appear in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.391" offset="16208959">And while the court, in authorizing the United States to appear, did designate the United States as amicus curiae, it went much further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.618" offset="16265801">The designation of the United States as amicus curiae in cases similar to this situation had occurred in both the Fahlbusch cases and the Bush cases, and it was used again in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.447" offset="16313135">But, the order of the court is the instrument to which we will look to see what authority the United States was given to appear as amicus curiae in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.530" offset="16369455">In every respect, may it please the Court, the United States was given precisely the same rights, the same authority that any party to a suit could be accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.703" offset="16418147">It was authorized to enter the case “with the right to submit pleadings, evidence, arguments, and briefs and to initiate proceedings for injunctive relief and proceedings for contempt of Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.911" offset="16487006">So, in a real sense, may it please the Court, the order entered and here involved emanated from an action brought or prosecuted in the name of the United States.</text>
