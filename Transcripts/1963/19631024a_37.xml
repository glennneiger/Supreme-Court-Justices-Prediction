            <text syncTime="25.088" offset="203734">This controversy had its inception about 1956 in the filing of acquired title suit in Richardson County, Nebraska is most quite title suits went, there was no big difference that involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.873" offset="270817">However, the defense by the defendants of the property was without the jurisdiction of the court that is in the adjoining State of Missouri, it was river bottom ground.</text>

            <label>Mr. August Ross</label>
            <text syncTime="83.284" offset="436537">I understand there's no such contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.925" offset="451062">And that there was a decision of the District Court of Douglas -- of Richardson County, Nebraska affirming the title of the plaintiff which was based on a tax deed and deeds from other individuals of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.543" offset="513546">Then, the Missouri claimant, if I may refer to her as such, prosecuted an appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.694" offset="558164">And under Nebraska procedure in an equity action, the trial is de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.793" offset="582510">And she has then a new and complete review of the evidence, on the record however, before the Nebraska Supreme Court and that Court affirmed the judgment of the Richardson County District Court, made fact findings and confirmed the convention of the District Court that the property was in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.759" offset="674356">And I might say in that regard, that every court that has reviewed the evidence has concluded that this ground originally was in Nebraska, of that, they all made the determination that when Nebraska was admitted to the union on basis of evidence offered, the ground in dispute was in Nebraska as opposed to being in Missouri and if -- of necessity, is in one State or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.121" offset="795878">After the judgment was affirmed in the Nebraska Supreme Court and she sought no appeal from that judgment to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.711" offset="842167">She went back across the river and then the Circuit Court, I believe, they call it, of the State of Missouri instituted precisely the same action, same parties, no dispute about, stipulated and found no (Inaudible), same real estate, no question about it, stipulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.171" offset="916041">They raise precisely the same issue, ownership of the ground and the -- repeated the contention that it is in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.786" offset="954493">The case was removed to the Federal District Court for the Western District of Missouri and tried there before Judge Duncan and the defense of res judicata was asserted and the court took evidence and by agreement, all of the evidence which -- went into the Nebraska court was received by stipulation of having been previously prepared in the Nebraska appellate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.801" offset="1078627">There was some offer of additional evidence but, in my opinion and consequential, it was matter to a forester who testified that a tree was cut on this ground and in his opinion the tree was of a certain age.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.789" offset="1138500">Well, it doesn't conflict with the ruling because the Nebraska court found that the ground -- the grounding question not only was in Nebraska, but it existed for a fixed period of time, it doesn't conflict with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.765" offset="1186461">And there was -- in this ground, I might state, is some one to two miles west and by west -- I mean -- I mean west, from where it was at the time Nebraska was admitted to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.304" offset="1248632">That's just to give you an idea of the distance that the river had to move in order to move with it at the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.775" offset="1286457">So that it was our contention there and the court, although it did find it necessary to determine on it, it was our contention that once that boundary line was established, it was incumbent upon them if they contended that the ground was in Missouri to establish that that river moved from its initial point at the time Nebraska was admitted as the result of accretion as opposed to avulsion because as soon as you have the first avulsion, the boundary would remain where it was and the state boundary wouldn't change it but the court concluded that the ground in question was situated west of a point where the river was established and didn't have to determine the other feature as to how the river got to where it was since it was already west of that particular point, the ground was in Nebraska and consequently, it didn't come to any conclusion as to how the river changed, that is whether by accretion or avulsion up to a point that is referred to in the pleadings and in the briefs, as what they call the old shoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.260" offset="1540368">So, I mentioned that so that there was really no dispute as to the fact that there's going to lease at one time was in Nebraska and the Nebraska court held that it is still in Nebraska.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.341" offset="1772753">And I might mention that he mentions it and he doesn't try to answer how the ground ever got from where it was originally at the time Nebraska was admitted to any particular point by accretion or avulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.223" offset="4080306">Well, if that is true, then Nebraska, on the other hand, has -- doesn't have to pay any attention to the Missouri judgment because if it's a matter of policy, Nebraska concludes that the judgment -- that the ground is in Nebraska and then can disregard the Missouri judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.044" offset="6003545">Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.780" offset="6022457">If you will bear with me, I'd like to belabor the evidence a little on this case because the facts should findings and the legal conclusions are based, in my judgment, primarily upon a rather complicated set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.611" offset="6069791">And I also expect to point out where Mr. Ross is in complete error in some statements he has made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.946" offset="6091107">Now, this involves title to approximately 808 acres of bottomland which lies in the Missouri River bottoms shortly south of what's known as the "Little Old Bridge", that's the railroad bridge leading from Missouri over to little old Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.935" offset="6151084">Richardson County, Nebraska is on the west side of the river, Missouri is on the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.652" offset="6169997">It's true the river, at that point, lies or flows south and easterly but I think you, gentlemen, will understand it better if we would assume that the river flows north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.958" offset="6211166">We can then place the left bank or the Missouri side on the east, the right bank or the Nebraska side on the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.384" offset="6236871">This land is all on the east side of the river and is all joined to Holt County, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.344" offset="6260799">Now, prior to 1855, there was a survey in 1855, prior to 1855, the Missouri River very definitely laid at the east of this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.745" offset="6298311">As some of you, gentlemen, will recognize a river of the type of the Missouri, a meandering river has, in historical times, occupied practically the entire bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.381" offset="6336867">The -- I would say the bottom of that point is, perhaps, and as an old duckhunter, I'm familiar with it, it's perhaps 12 or 14 miles wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.101" offset="6367796">There is a lake, a big lake in Missouri located -- a state park, located a mile or two east of this present land which obviously is an obstacle remaining from one of the convolutions of the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.795" offset="6418578">So there is no question that the river, and time has passed, has occupied all of the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.325" offset="6440626">In 1955, it had moved to the west from its prior location, but at that survey, it was still east of the land in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.133" offset="6475943">Now, in -- by the 1930s, the river was entirely west of the land in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.865" offset="6506872">This suit, when it was filed, was filed not only against Julia Duke, who the defender or who I will call "Duke", but against her mother, Nelly Duke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.257" offset="6552430">Now, in the teams, Duke's father, secured land lying east of their land in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.539" offset="6597569">This land, according to the testimony, began to accrete to that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.510" offset="6613452">And in the early 1920s, Duke's father was raising cattle on this land, making use of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.318" offset="6640619">The land was forming, as we contend, as accreted land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.232" offset="6660263">Duke herself began curing the land later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.745" offset="6670399">She got a swamp land title from Missouri in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.307" offset="6696626">Mr. Durfee, who has never been on the land, that when Mr. Ross said he moved the house over there, Mr. Ross is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.425" offset="6733093">A house was moved over there and was placed on land belonging to the Cunninghams, which has nothing to do with this, and the Cunninghams told him to get off because he was trespassing and he got off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.976" offset="6783248">No house has ever been placed on this land by Mr. Durfee and Mr. Durfee has not been in possession of this land and the record will so indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.909" offset="6818983">Now, when this suit was instigated and as to Judge Blackman's opinion from the Eight Circuit clearly indicates, the suit was not only against Julia Duke but Mr. Durfee claimed he owned the Nelly Duke land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.904" offset="6874990">He claimed all of this land and the theory was that the river in 1855 was over here and by avulsion in the 1930s that it leaped over here, therefore, all the land in between remain Nebraska land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.525" offset="6925458">It was the theory of the Dukes that the river moved to the west by slow degrees, accreting on the east and decreting or cutting away on the -- on the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.220" offset="6964224">Now, in the District -- Mr. Justice Goldberg, asked a question about service, Julia Duke is not a resident of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.709" offset="6994213">She has never been a resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.225" offset="7000273">She is not susceptible of service there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.793" offset="7010513">But in my judgment, she was badly advised and she went over there and entered her appearance and tried the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.887" offset="7030888">I was not in the lawsuit at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.117" offset="7039875">But she did go over there and consent to try the case in the District Court in Nebraska, which is the original trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.333" offset="7064743">Now, in that case, bear in mind that Durfee, who had never been on the land and who had a tax title he got in 1956 for something less than $500 as opposed to the many thousands of dollars Duke had spent clearing portions of this land, he claimed it under a tax title and the Blackman opinion points it out, the Blackman opinion says, no -- in so many words that defendant Gene Durfee and Laura, his wife, claimed title of the land under Richardson County, Nebraska sheriff's tax foreclosure sale division to them in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.852" offset="7190758">Now, for some unknown reason, when they talk about belaboring the evidence in Judge Duncan's opinion, and I'll come to that, the District Court, the trial court in Nebraska, in a very cursory opinion consisting of approximately two paragraphs, I believe, its in the record, divides the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.074" offset="7267662">No rhyme, no reason, no statement why, but the court finds that the Nelly Duke land is Missouri land, which means, therefore, that the river did accrete, move west slowly at least to that point, but then suddenly finds that the rest of the land is Nebraska land and belongs to Durfee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.041" offset="7339551">It went to the Supreme Court of Nebraska and it was tried de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.989" offset="7351359">Now, bear in mind, the original claim of the petitioners was the river made one jump by avulsion from here over to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.854" offset="7378840">The Supreme Court of Nebraska tries it on a totally different theory and finds that by some hook or crook that the land got down between Nelly Duke -- or the river got down between Nelly Duke and Julia Duke and then it jumped over here west and then it jumped back again to a form of shoot but the land remained intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.732" offset="7454281">Now, that brings up the question of this tree which Mr. Ross says it below -- as -- of little value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.155" offset="7479986">There was a state forester from the Conservation Commission of the State of Missouri who testified that on river bottomlands in the Missouri River Valley, the first rule is (Inaudible) rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.983" offset="7519274">Within a year, trees began in the form of cottonwoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.448" offset="7541112">Now, bear in mind that this land was suppose to have existed intact from 18 -- 1855 until the time of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.515" offset="7581445">The cottonwood germinates about a year later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.975" offset="7591267">The largest tree on the uncleared area of the land was cut in section and the section was brought into court as evidence and it was aged by a forester and it is undisputed that the tree which was cut in 1959, the largest tree on the area, lot of the land that had not been cleared, was 35 years old, therefore, it began to germinate in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.639" offset="7693876">And quite obviously, the land could not have been in existence all of these years or they're very deft and it would have been older trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.871" offset="7722820">There were no older trees on the area which substantiates the theory of accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.514" offset="7749465">Now, after this suit was tried in the Supreme Court of Nebraska, and as I say, affirmed for what reason I do not know, I can't understand their language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.354" offset="7792828">It was decided that this was neither full faith from credit and it was not res judicata and that Missouri had a perfect right to determine for itself the question of land belonging to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.310" offset="11836583">But I would say this, that in the -- the crux of the whole thing is, there is a -- there are two policies, as Judge Blackman pointed out, the policy in favor of the curtail of ending a litigation and the policy in -- in favor of letting a State determine its own -- its own sovereign rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.649" offset="11905964">And in the reinstatement of the law in 1943, under judgment, there was -- there were five reasons where this wouldn't standup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.938" offset="11939088">At the same time under conflicts, conflicts didn't say that but it said, "We express no opinion whether and how far -- far you're appearing and participating in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.518" offset="11973465">It's precluded from many questions, the jurisdiction, the court or the subject matter," that's 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.827" offset="11994676">In 1948, in the restatement of -- of the law of conflicts that caveat has been removed and they have copied exactly what it says in judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.848" offset="12034800">And in that, they say where a court is jurisdictional with the parties, it says it has jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.955" offset="12055176">There -- among others, there are five things which weigh heavily why that does not standup or why it does not res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.144" offset="12083911">One, is the lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.176" offset="12096031">Judge Duncan four times and said there was no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.340" offset="12104704">It is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.504" offset="12109406">The fifth is the policy against the court's acting beyond its jurisdiction is strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.741" offset="12126333">You, gentlemen, in many of your decisions which I have cited, have repeatedly said that that policy is strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.415" offset="12149008">Now, there is an argument here that there must be an end to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.777" offset="12162487">I -- this -- well, it has intrigued me and might intrigue some of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.167" offset="12184012">The Supreme Court of Missouri has been just as zealous as this Court in protecting the rights of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.515" offset="12201462">I say the rights of individuals are paramount when it comes to the question as to whether they should be curtailed or litigations should be curtailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.995" offset="12231346">And in the earlier 1840s, prior to the civil war, a colored slave with the name of Charlotte sued the Chouteau family in St. Louis, which was then the leading family in St. Louis, to have her declared free and no longer a slave and she contended she'd been to Canada where -- where slavery was not acknowledged and was, therefore, emancipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.241" offset="12304384">Four times, somebody put up the money for her to fight that in the Circuit Court of St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.224" offset="12324237">Four times, she went to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.142" offset="12335940">Three times the Supreme Court -- the first two times she lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.952" offset="12351195">In both times to protect her rights, the Supreme sent it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.410" offset="12364988">The third time, she won it and Chouteau appealed and the Supreme Court sent it back in the fourth time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.316" offset="12388603">And I have cited that Charlotte versus Chouteau.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.385" offset="12396962">There -- there are four different decisions showing that our courts have zealously put the rights of an individual far and above the desired curtail litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.936" offset="12519111">First place, I like to point out that patents had been issued by the United States Government in the State of Nebraska to people of Nebraska on this ground so that the title did emanate from the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.680" offset="12570102">A chain of title did commence on this very ground from the United States to residents of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.658" offset="12601971">Secondly, we're in accord that, of course, this determination has no binding effect on the States itself as to the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.080" offset="12627675">With reference to the case that he cited at (Inaudible) versus 171 acres, the Court will find on review this situation, the suit required title was filed in the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.074" offset="12671666">I've been attempted to find out but can't determine but I'm advised that they did not litigate in that court any jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.755" offset="12702386">Subsequent to the entry of the judgment in Iowa, they then brought the judgment to Nebraska for recording under a special statutory proceeding for the recording of foreign judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.030" offset="12743450">At that time, that court litigated the jurisdictional question and concluded that jurisdiction was wanting in Iowa because the ground was in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.111" offset="12787858">That is as far as the opinion will go because in completing their appellate process, they fumbled the ball, they didn't get a review and so the judgments stood firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.303" offset="12840626">In other words, they neglected to get the bill of exceptions --</text>

            <label>Mr. August Ross</label>
            <text syncTime="3250.852" offset="13106761">First, if I may address myself to Justice Goldberg in an answer to the question he asked me about what could be the party have done on -- on the affirmance of the judgment from the Nebraska Supreme Court and I responded earlier that perhaps there was not a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.274" offset="13160469">Well, frankly, it was not my problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.843" offset="13166738">I can't say that -- that there is or none but it appears to me on reflection also that if we have a situation where a Nebraska court was taking Missouri grounds, you might very well had a federal question of taking property without due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.122" offset="13227865">But as I said that I'm outing up the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.549" offset="13241553">Referring to the actual crux of this thing and particularly to the opinion filed by the Circuit Court of Appeals here and then the court relies as has been earlier pointed out on the restatement for its authority and there are five criteria that are set out under restatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.020" offset="13323473">The first of them being that the lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.252" offset="13344371">I would like to point out that in coming to that particular criteria, the Eighth Circuit Court itself says that Nebraska's lack of jurisdiction is not particularly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.672" offset="13398079">In other words, here, they are and they go on with the rest of the item.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.616" offset="13421798">Determination of jurisdiction dependent on a question of law rather than fact, that's the second criterion and the court says, "No, that's not applicable."</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.066" offset="13455653">They come to the next criterion and say the court was one of limited, not general jurisdiction, they say, "No, that's not applicable."</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.977" offset="13483238">But the question was not actually litigated and the court says, "No, that that is not applicable."</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.683" offset="13502151">So we actually have a situation then they come to the last one that says that the policy against the courts acting beyond it's jurisdiction is strong, that's the only remaining criteria and then they relate that one back to the lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter but they had already determined that the court's lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter is not particularly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.326" offset="13604655">So I submit that aside from the fact that if this is a proper determination of the law, there is no form in which we can get a final answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.206" offset="13648227">That actually, its reasoning in -- is inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.058" offset="13671633">Inconsistent in that they state that the policy which is involved is at one State should not rule upon the jurisdiction of land in another State and then the same breadth, they said that the lack of -- of Nebraska's jurisdiction was not clear and that was the very issue which Nebraska had to decide in determining whether it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.533" offset="13765465">One or two other items that were mentioned and -- I don't think they go to the merits of it but that there was other ground involved when this action was originally filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.158" offset="13800051">The only answer in saying that, that when original lawsuit was filed, in addition to describing the grounds to which we had actual deeds, there was a thought that there might be other accretion land involved and the description was enlarged on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.850" offset="13850728">The lower court held that we did not prevail as to the other, no cross-appeal was taken and no question really involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.859" offset="13882807">I don't think that it ever should get to the point that all of us lawyers make mistakes and I'm afraid our clients have to suffer with them but it -- it was an unfortunate choice as to her counsel in agreeing to come in to a Nebraska court and litigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.547" offset="13945605">Nevertheless, that's the honor of the dilemma that she chose and I submit respectfully under the law of res judicata that that decision should be by mean.</text>
