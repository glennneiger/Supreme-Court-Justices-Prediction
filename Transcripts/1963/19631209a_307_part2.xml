            <label>Mr. Vincent A. Theisen</label>
            <text syncTime="34.564" offset="242688">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.930" offset="260138">The decision of the statutory court below, consisting as this Court knows, of Judge Biggs, Judge Wright and Judge Layton, declaring the apportionment provisions of the Delaware Constitution inviolate under the Fourteenth Amendment and the subsequent injunction which restrained the defendants, appellants below from conducting any elections for the membership of the General Assembly was, in our opinion, clearly correct in both instances and we ask that the opinion below be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.274" offset="445503">Now, because my friend, Mr. Wiener, suggests that there are maybe some novelty present in the Delaware litigation that was not argued heretofore in the other reapportionment cases that your -- the bench heard during the week of November 12th of this year, we think it might be appropriate to define more precisely the issues that were presented to the court below, the issues therefore they are before you, and are set forth, if I may, a more clear exposition of the grounds upon which that decision below rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.672" offset="607044">As a prologue to my argument, permit me to agree in principle with Colonel Wiener that Delaware, perhaps, in some ways, is very unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.174" offset="661065">It was, as Your Honors know, the first case -- the first state rather to ratify the Constitution of the United States, an event which we celebrate in our State each December 7th of each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.919" offset="720102">One of the 13 original colonies, it ranks second smallest in area of the 50 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.262" offset="757405">It is smaller in this regard as this Court heard than Saint Lawrence County in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.600" offset="786766">It is smaller, of course, than many counties throughout this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.162" offset="805052">It is 48th of the 50 States in population in -- and that is, it ranks 48th in numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.466" offset="842250">Its northern border is about 94 miles away from its southern border.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.178" offset="869104">At its widest point, it is about 35 miles in width that is on the southern end of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.724" offset="903272">On the upper end, it is about an arc of 8 miles drawn from New Castle County's Courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.720" offset="931276">Its highest point, Your Honors please, is about 440 feet above sea -- sea level.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.517" offset="966489">It contains no dormitory counties, such as you have heard exist in Maryland or in Connecticut or in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.188" offset="1005150">It has no large military concentrations within its borders such as Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.681" offset="1039109">It has no offshore islands such as Rhode Island or Massachusetts, nor does it have any widely separated regions such as -- are to be found in the upper peninsula of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.003" offset="1100445">Delaware is uniquely compact and uniquely accessible from one end of the State to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.836" offset="1143704">Our capital is, as you know, in Dover and Dover is situate about 50 miles from Wilmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.778" offset="1179544">It is within easy accessible driving range, within one hour from any portion of our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.264" offset="1213503">Our legislators who meet in the General Assembly, a number of whom are here today to hear these arguments, commute daily back and forth from their homes to Dover into the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.429" offset="1266061">So we have none of the other problems as we see it that might affect your decision in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.601" offset="1294796">Ours is uniquely our case and we would like to confine our unique case for your consideration to the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.251" offset="1337428">The Delaware General Assembly is a bicameral body.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.125" offset="1360938">It consists, of course, of a Senate, an upper House and a House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.706" offset="1387269">The composition of both of these Houses was fixed by the Convention of 1896 and became effective in 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.714" offset="1435230">We have not had reapportionment prior to the institution of this suit since 1897 and before that we had no apportionment in our State -- reapportionment from the period of 1831 to 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.238" offset="1509313">Now then, in 1897, the Convention contrived of a House of Representatives consisting not of county representation, if you please, but it created geographical representative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.360" offset="1581829">It created 35 of those districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.726" offset="1595308">Now, it happens that 10 of the representative districts are to be found and were allotted to the rural areas of our three counties and as Mr. Wiener has stated, we have but three counties in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.674" offset="1659047">The five remaining of the 35 representative districts were allotted to the City of Wilmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.527" offset="1690499">In the Senate, it created again 17 representative geographical rather senatorial geographical districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.806" offset="1727592">And those 17 geographical distri -- districts were again so constituted that geographically, five or in each of the rural areas of the three counties and two were to be found within the City of Wilmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.029" offset="1796556">Now, as I stated we've had no reapportionment prior to the institution of suit and the Constitution of 1897 provided for no periodic reapportionment of our General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.476" offset="1850264">We have neither initiative nor referendum in our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.123" offset="1884850">When the Constitution was adopted in the State of Delaware in 1897, the population of our State was approximately 180,000 inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.751" offset="1931452">105 of those persons resided in the city -- resided rather in New Castle County.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.335" offset="1957784">70,000 of them resided in the City of Wilmington and 35,000 in the rural areas outside of Wilmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.657" offset="1999057">At that time, 35,000 persons inhabited the rural areas of Kent County and 38,000 resided in the rural areas of Sussex County.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.150" offset="2045032">Now, when the Constitution was adopted, as will appear by the debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1896, the people who lived in the rural areas of our State were considered to be identical not only in their vocations but in their interest and consequently, I believe it made logical sense to allot to them equality since their representation, the number of persons who lived in the rural areas were substantially identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.042" offset="2176585">However, Wilmington, with a population of 70,000, was given different considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.609" offset="2206783">Instead of allotting representation to Wilmington on a population basis, it was given a SOP of two senatorial representatives and five additional representatives in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.082" offset="2272716">Now, what happened in Delaware is, I suppose, what has happened in a great number of other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.141" offset="2300928">We have had a tremendous population explosion in our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.187" offset="2321095">It was not conceivable, I'm sure in 1897 for our legislators to have known or to have anticipated the direction in which this population explosion might have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.982" offset="2372295">We did not know that by 1960, our Sate would've reached 446,000 in inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.545" offset="2402597">We did not know, of course, that by 1960, 307,000 of 446,000 would be residing in New Castle County.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.448" offset="2446169">We didn't know what would happen in the suburbs of Wilmington and what has happened since 19 -- 1896 is that that population has increased now to 211,000 persons from which we now still get the same representation of five members in the House -- rather 10 members in the House and five in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.418" offset="2566019">In the same period of time, New Castle County or rather Kent County has grown to 65,000 and Sussex County about 75 -- 73,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.397" offset="2617950">Thus, by 1960, 69% of our entire state population resides in New Castle County, 14%, approximately, reside in Kent and approximately 16% in Sussex County.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.140" offset="2689003">Because of this irregular population explosion, and the fact that all attempts prior to 1962 to reapportion the state legislature had failed, and I might point out to Your Honors that in the six years that preceded, the institution of this suit, there had been seven attempts made in the General Assembly of our State to achieve some kind of reapportionment in the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.333" offset="2813764">Of the seven bills that were presented, one reached the floor and was promptly voted down.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.770" offset="2847514">The other six never came out of committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.489" offset="2862352">So that in 1960, with this irregular population explosion and the districts frozen in, the representative districts ranged in size from about 1643 inhabitants in the New Castle County 15th representative district to over 58,000 in New Castle County's 6th District.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.871" offset="2959841">This, gentlemen, is a disparity of over 35-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.151" offset="2981052">Similar disparities are to be found between the districts not only in New Castle County, not only in Kent County, not only in Sussex County but also, of course, in the City of Wilmington.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.820" offset="3223677">Now, in Kent County, we had -- well, in Wilmington, for example, we had one district, the 4th District that has 5300 in population and right next to it in the 5th District, there are over 30,000 inhabitants living there.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.773" offset="3291491">Similarly, in the City of Wilmington, another district has 33,000 as compared with the 5300 in the 4th District.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.164" offset="4301072">For example, the 15th District of New Castle County which is the smallest one with 1643 inhabitants, was left that way even though since 1890, that hundred has increased about 143 inhabitants in that entire time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.336" offset="4497721">As a matter of fact, Mr. Justice Goldberg, if you would -- the record shows and we have it in our appendix that Mr. Wilson, who was admitted here today, a fine lawyer in Wilmington, was chairman of the committee, the Governor's bipartisan committee, stated in the trial of this cause that the reason they didn't change the provisions of Article II, Section 2 of 1897 as far as it relates to future constitutional conventions was because they didn't want the reapportionment to apply to that Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.874" offset="4635857">It's obvious that this is a question of under representation or being bucked by the overrepresented areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.505" offset="4678384">If I may continue, I was reciting the situation that existed in 1960 insofar as the House was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.364" offset="4717881">In 1960, as we have stated, 18.5% of the population of the State of Delaware was able to elect a majority in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.804" offset="4763648">In the Senate, a similar situation existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.486" offset="4778381">The seven geographical senatorial districts that lie within New Castle County represented a total population of over 307,000 while the five in Sussex County represented about 73,000 and those five in Kent, 65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.579" offset="4858734">The senatorial districts in 1962 ranged from 65,000 to 4000 so that a vote in the smallest senatorial district in Delaware was worth almost 16 times the vote in the largest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.668" offset="4927070">22% of our entire population elected the majority in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.864" offset="4951834">And this, if Your Honors will recall, prompted the Solicitor General in his brief to say that Delaware represented the worst represented General Assembly of any of the 50, third worst, sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.196" offset="5021215">Now, these disparities that I have spoken off existed not only on an inter-county basis, they're also on an intra-county basis and they are to be found, as I pointed out, within the City of Wilmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.020" offset="5080461">My friend would state that the basis of discriminatory, the utmost of discrimination in this field would be a crazy quilt type of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.225" offset="5129258">I don't think that you can find a better example of a crazy quilt apportionment than you can in the Delaware situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.747" offset="5163426">Often, the discriminations exist, as I pointed out, in adjoining districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.049" offset="5184637">Sometimes, the difference is simply the question of whether you live on one side of a street or on the other side of a street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.510" offset="5214417">Sometimes, it's a question of whether you live on this side of a creek or on the other side of a creek, even though the persons on both sides of the street are identical and on both sides of the street are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.162" offset="5269065">Now, we have heard today about the amendment of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.321" offset="5293725">This was instituted in the 1962 legislature and finally consummated in 1963 and we refer to it as the 1963 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.811" offset="5327684">And we think the effect of that represent -- of that amendment was to freeze into the senatorial districts representation of New Castle County, the seven existing districts and the effect of adding two additional floterial or at large senators in both Kent and Sussex and where the total membership of the Senate was increased from 17 to 21 and by adding the four floterial senators to areas having about 31% of the population at the expense of the areas containing 69% of the population and it's interesting to know that when questioned, the chairman of the bipartisan committee that prepared this bill, stated that when they allotted the four additional senators to the two lower county areas, they did not take into account population at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.436" offset="5594133">Now, in the House, they divide the House into 10 additional districts by dividing the more populous districts on the basis of 15,000 populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.133" offset="5644915">The smaller districts, even in the same county, were left untouched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.076" offset="5672709">The amendment, as I have pointed out, also froze into future constitutional conventions, the composition of the General Assembly as it existed in 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.343" offset="5721819">And so the effect of the amendment, if I may summarize it, was that in Kent and Sussex Counties, in the House, it had no effect and it perpetuated discrepancies that existed of over ten-and-half to one in Kent and over eleven-and-half to one in Sussex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.813" offset="5791619">In New Castle County even after the subdivision and the creation of 10 additional districts, we still have discrepancies as high as 12-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.892" offset="5831952">We still have numerous discrepancies of 11-to-1 and many at 10-to-1 and under the amendment, instead of the 18.5% of the population that prior to the -- could elect the majority, it now is about 28% of the population of our State that can elect the majority in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.935" offset="5916170">After the amendment, the disparities in population in New Castle ranged from 4100 to 64,000 or over 15-to-1 in New Castle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.875" offset="5971864">In Kent, they range from 7000 to 46,000 or six-and-half to one, in Sussex, from 9000 to 38,000 or over four-and-half to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.850" offset="6019824">After the amendment, Kent, with a population of about 14.5%, now elects one-third of our Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.951" offset="6056187">Each voter in Kent County now elects two-twenty-first of our Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.671" offset="6079070">The same thing is true in Sussex County with about 16.5% of the population, but after the amendment, New Castle with 69% is still permitted to elect about one-third of the Senate and our residents in our county in our senatorial districts can vote for about one twenty-first of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.445" offset="6174156">Now, it was obviously in the light of these facts and many others that were developed during the trial in the District Court below that the opinion of April 17th which held Article II, Section 2 as existed both before and after the amendment to be unconstitutional in violation of the Equal Protection Clause should be viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.100" offset="6280840">The court below said that these disparities resulted in gross and invidious discrimination against the plaintiffs in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.169" offset="6329114">The court could find no rational or reasonable basis for the apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.461" offset="6358267">Contrary to what has been said here, it -- I think throughout the entire course of the litigation considered that basically, the problem of reapportionment was a matter for the General Assembly of the State to properly apportion itself in accordance with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.834" offset="6455756">In this regard, honoring the request of counsel for the defendants below, the court laid down certain guidelines, standards that in the apportionment of the House of Representatives of Delaware, the basis must be one of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.753" offset="6535377">It adopted this Court's ruling in Sander Gray -- Sanders versus Gray and announced that one vote, one person must be the aim and that in the Senate, while population must be given the heaviest vote, other factors such as diverse interests, county governmental functions, geography, area, historic and economic differences might be considered provided that no wide deviation from the principle of population representation would be permitted and then, only if the deviation served a valid legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.370" offset="6705904">In reaching that conclusion, the Court applied the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause and in this regard, I believe it is explicitly supported and sustained by the ruling of this Court in Baker versus Carr whereas as we see it, Baker stated a rule that was more than procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.388" offset="6809976">Baker stated the rule that gross dilutions of voting rights which result from unlawful discriminations against people lead to limitations that exceed the constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.251" offset="6865356">And that this conclusion of the Court in Baker versus Carr is correct, we believe is supported by the overwhelming number of federal, lower federal and state courts, which have followed that rule since the ruling of Baker versus Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.589" offset="6942783">We think also that the court below was following the mandate contained in the closing words of Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in that case where he said, "The complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection presents a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial and a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.723" offset="7055318">" Now, in reaching the conclusion below, it is our feeling that the Court followed what it considered to be and what are traditionally considered to be the well-established concepts and tests of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.042" offset="7128566">It found that the discriminations, inequalities that existed reflected no policy and were simply arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.112" offset="7180810">The Court, as I have stated, adopted the principle of representation or the principle or the equality and majority rule, the concept that one person and one vote must be applied according to the court below to both houses of the General Assembly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.470" offset="7466277">They felt that one of the issues in the case that remained was, what kind of a plan of apportionment, if any, should be adopted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.769" offset="7519462">We certainly felt that we were litigating the question of what kind of a plan would be acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.843" offset="7547779">We, therefore, presented our own plan which included both houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.896" offset="7575991">In the course of the trial as has been stated by Colonel Wiener, the Court did hand counsel a former plan for the House alone and asked our comment on that, but we had hoped that we would get across-the-board relief because we don't think relief in one house is substantial relief in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.503" offset="7666375">But I think technically, I must say to Your Honor, that the Court could have decided the matter only on the House and I think it did, but the Court went on because counsel, in the course of trial, had requested guidelines be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.299" offset="7733561">The Court then went on and in Judge Biggs' words, used precatory, precatory advice, gave precatory advice to the General Assembly as to what that Court considered would be the minimum plan under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.925" offset="8264056">There was a claim made in the -- in the Convention of 1896 that Delaware should adopt the federal analogy and we have quoted at page 10, I believe, 9 and 10 of our motion – brief in support of our motion to affirm below a few excerpts from the debates that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.404" offset="8370009">I read from Mr. Nathan Pratt, "I do not regard a county as I do a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.581" offset="8394668">I cannot understand on what ground such a comparison can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.659" offset="8411073">" And William Salisbury said, "In the State of Delaware, we have no such conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.097" offset="8428732">A county is not an independent sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.138" offset="8440957">The counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex were never free and independent States of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.049" offset="8468543">" Now, this federal analogy was rejected completely in the Convention of 1896 and why it should be resurrected in 1963 is something beyond me, I can't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.612" offset="8534894">I come to this question of county sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.414" offset="8550045">We think that the claim that Delaware should be in the classification of federal analogy is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.374" offset="8589855">First, we can find no comparable incidence of history in Delaware which are analogous to the situation that necessitated that compromised in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.821" offset="8635726">We never had such a historic event as we had in the Connecticut compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.881" offset="8659968">Secondly, the counties of Delaware were never sovereign and I don't believe that any of the witnesses in the trial of this Court so stated, but if they were, it would be our position that such fact would be irrelevant to any of the issues before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.247" offset="8741366">We are concerned here not with county discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.259" offset="8761428">We are concerned here with the action of the State of Delaware in denying these plaintiffs equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.826" offset="8791730">I know of no charge that any county is involved in these discriminations and as a matter of fact in Delaware, counties have -- they're integral part of our State but they form no governmental function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.918" offset="8972079">Of course, another comment on that is that the Delaware House of Representatives is, of course, not apportioned strictly on population while the federal house, we believe is so apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.134" offset="9028921">And in Delaware, as we pointed out, 18.5% or 28% whichever -- you are considering the old Constitution or the amendment of the population can now elect the majority in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.451" offset="9082211">While, as we show in our brief, it takes approximately 50% of the population of the States to constitute a majority in the United States House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.846" offset="9127769">And lastly, the federal analogy is not applicable to Delaware because our senators are not chosen from the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.251" offset="9161415">They're chosen from representative districts that happen to be situated in the counties and the discrimination that exist is not a county vis-à-vis county, it's a representative district or a senatorial district vis-à-vis one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.982" offset="9236334">So that we don't think that Mr. Wiener's argument on the federal analogy should be applied to the Delaware Legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.175" offset="9313134">We pointed out at the beginning that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the rationale of the disparities existing in the General Assembly of the State of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.815" offset="9363707">It is an argument, we believe, that was made first had its genesis in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Brown versus Topeka.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.184" offset="9437163">It was repeated with special application by Mr. Justice Frank -- Frankfurter in the dissent in Baker versus Carr and there rejected and as I understand it, it has been reintroduced into the reapportionment suit -- arguments in the Maryland case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2362.806" offset="9555655">In the Brown case, this Court refused to turn the clock back to 1868 and considered public education in the light of a full development and present place in American life throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.654" offset="9623050">No other apportion, we believe, of the Constitution with the exception perhaps, of the Commerce Clause, has had so much elasticity as the due process, public, Equal Protection Clause, but we're not here, it seems to us, to argue the abstract questions, which Mr. Wiener presents of what the Fourteenth Amendment might have meant in 1868 in the field of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.024" offset="9748543">If we are here, it seems to us, to argue the question of whether the Equal Protection Clause means today what you said it meant, as we interpret it, in Baker v. -- versus Carr.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.374" offset="9853868">Now, we don't think that Mr. Wiener's contemporaneous construction helps us very much in arriving today at what the Fourteenth Amendment means in the field of apportionment of General Assemblies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.856" offset="9931818">Moreover, we think that it's apparent from the discussion that we've heard this morning that the Fourteenth Amendment was not particularly designed to meet the challenge or the problem of the apportionment of state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.297" offset="10005588">We think that a careful reading of the cases of this Court indicates that the Fourteenth Amendment was chiefly concerned with the then current problem of protecting the rights of Negroes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.316" offset="11465624">In early July, as Colonel Wiener has stated, of 1962, the Governor appointed a bipartisan reapportionment committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.296" offset="11517555">They met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.535" offset="11522570">They had three sessions prior to July 25th, 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.184" offset="11645137">An application was made prior to July 25th by the appellants below to stay the action of the court until that plan could be presented to the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.112" offset="11708876">The court did grant the stay to the -- in the proceedings until August 7th, and it did so because of the representation that this plan was ready and would be presented to the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.908" offset="11771988">Now, my friend would make haste out of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.903" offset="11787975">I say to you that he was not present below and I think might have misjudged a little bit of the tempo of the trial, the speed of the trial and the necessity of the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.930" offset="11840115">Judge Biggs, with all of his many, many years on the bench, stated on at least three occasions as an indication of his concern with the importance of this case that it was the -- the most important case that he had sat on in the 25 years that he had sat on the federal bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.700" offset="11931230">I can assure you gentlemen, if assurance need be given, that the question of haste, pressure and so forth that is alleged to have been attributed to Judge Biggs just did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.012" offset="12012419">He granted the stay until August 7th and there was good reason for granting the stay until August 7th because if the plan was to be adopted, an amendment to the Constitution, it would require publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.824" offset="12071664">The publication had to be made before the 4th or 5th of August.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.608" offset="12090786">And therefore, if the plan was not going to be passed by the -- by the General Assembly, there was no reason to stay the proceedings any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.389" offset="12129970">I might point out that in the -- in the first opinion of Judge Biggs, he suggested to the General Assembly that they consider the question of passing a statute providing that apportionment in the General Assembly of this State shall be by statute, not as a permanent harbor but as a temporary haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.747" offset="12223384">This, of course, was ignored by the legislature which went ahead and passed the invalid amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.359" offset="12253790">Now, I think the briefs are adequately replete with the references which we have made to the timing of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.957" offset="12300184">It was April 17th, 1963 before the court handed down its final opinion on the merits to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.221" offset="12345323">Between July 25th, 1962 and April 17th, 1930, counsels were completely aware of what was going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.984" offset="12408330">On April 30th when the opinion was handed down, the court, again, in its over abundance of caution to try to help the General Assembly assume its responsibility which it had not assumed to reapportion the State, granted the legislature an additional time from the date of the decree which is April 30th until October 1st to pass an appropriate statute relating to reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.410" offset="12538002">As Mr. Justice Goldberg has pointed out through his questioning, the legislature just has -- simply has not taken any effective steps since that date and here it is, December of 1963 and still no steps have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.360" offset="12613862">This, I submit, is in line with what the -- we have alleged in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.354" offset="12633819">We have stated the numerous occasions on which we have attempted to get a reapportionment in the State of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.998" offset="12668406">We have met with legislatives still made on this question and unless this Court will lay down the minimum standards or will affirm below, I don't think we're going to get -- let any reapportionment in Delaware for good number of years to come.</text>

            <text syncTime="3695.942" offset="14888187">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.148" offset="14905010">I must confess that I found the task of planning a fifth argument on the subject of apportionment within a month is somewhat difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.855" offset="14951821">I concluded that it would be most helpful if I were to devote my time today to three aspects of this specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.190" offset="14997170">First, I shall endeavor to show that this case does not raise any question about the power of a State to model its legislature after the federal analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.919" offset="15048056">The case to which appellants' briefs are chiefly directed in our judgment simply isn't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.977" offset="15080344">Second, coming to the case that is here --</text>

            <text syncTime="3748.615" offset="15098838">Petition of the Senate is not here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3751.078" offset="15108660">No, that's because there is, in our judgment for reason I'll state in a moment, no resemblance between the apportionment of either house of the Delaware Legislature and the apportionment of the seats in the Federal Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.503" offset="15162368">Second, coming to the case that is here, I shall argue that the apportionment of the Delaware Legislature results in gross discrimination between persons, groups of persons without any basis in policy and is therefore, unconstitutional under established principles of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.722" offset="15247318">And third, I shall try to answer briefly some of the appellants' arguments directed to the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly its early history and interpretation which I submit if they have any relevance are really abridge to reargue Baker against Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.753" offset="15327357">The appellants state on page 10 of their reply brief that the basic question for decision is whether anything in the Equal Protection Clause forbids a State from patterning its legislature on the federal model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.876" offset="15387857">As I said a moment ago, we submit that this case does not present that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.403" offset="15410009">The Delaware Legislature is unlike the Congress of the United States for four -- because of four fundamental differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.705" offset="15451178">In the first place, the composition of the Delaware Senate is utterly unlike the composition of the Senate of the Unites States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.433" offset="15482107">The United States senators are there to represent States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.812" offset="15499661">The States are, for many purposes, sovereign entities, each with its own historical identity, each with existing political function, a coherence of its own and the senators are chosen at large by the peoples of the State to represent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.157" offset="15569042">Now, assuming that counties are like States and I assume it’s solely for the purpose of argument, still, the Delaware senators do not represent the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.165" offset="15613032">The 21 senators are chosen by 21 geographical districts established for the sole purpose of choosing senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.102" offset="15648768">Each senator is chosen by his district, represents the district and not the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.083" offset="15680742">So far as one can see, the legislature might establish these five counties instead of three or abolish all counties and it would have not the slightest effect on the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.613" offset="15738838">That essential difference, as a matter of fact, is reflected in the fact that the Delaware Senate today is apportioned very like the apportionment under the 1896 Constitution and the districts are the same except for a few that was added or one can get out it in other way and suppose that it were possible to amend the Constitution so as to divide each State into senatorial districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.766" offset="15851478">We would suppose that that was a very radical change in the composition of our Congress and I think it shows the radical difference between the composition of the Delaware Senate and the composition of the Senate of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.393" offset="15909992">Now, the appellants say, "Well, this was never suggested to us before."</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.154" offset="15932980">The point is here, whether it was suggested or not and they say, "Well, we didn't want to have our senators chosen at large."</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.817" offset="15963700">Well that's all right, they may have had very good reasons for rejecting the federal analogy, but their reasons for rejecting it cannot make something fundamentally different into the same thing as the Senate of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.009" offset="16028484">Second, the Constitution, the Federal Constitution contemplates a lower House apportioned essentially in accordance with population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.185" offset="16069130">Nothing in the Constitution requires or sanctions gross inequalities in per capita representation in the lower chamber.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.817" offset="16107687">Seats in the Delaware Lower House on the other hand are not apportioned either among counties or within counties on the basis of population.</text>

            <text syncTime="4096.434" offset="16490120">Appellants' answer to our point about the lack of per capita representation in the House is that well, the House -- the purpose was to make the apportionment of the House conform to population, a purpose which the subsequent unadopted report of the committee would have effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.825" offset="16575697">Well, I submit that if that was their purpose, they fell far short and we're concerned with what they did not with their purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.388" offset="16617911">And so far as their future intentions go, there would be nothing adjudicated here that would prevent them from carrying out their future intentions but we're concerned now with the constitutionality of something on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.667" offset="16683112">Third, in Delaware, there is no rational basis for the apportionment of seats in either house -- either branch of the Delaware Legislature whereas the apportionment in the Federal Constitution is certainly in accordance with an intelligible rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.264" offset="16749464">And fourth, we find out that Delaware's 1963 amendment creates or perhaps I should say continuous gross discrimination of a kind which the federal system has never created.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.785" offset="16811530">Appellants say to that in their reply brief that this assertion is contrary to fact and they go on to say that inequalities in per capita representation in the United States Senate are greater than the ine -- inequalities between the three Delaware counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.828" offset="16875687">Well, that's true, but I think its a little acting whoever says that an orange is different from an apple is a liar, both have skin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.146" offset="16909019">The fact is that there are many other kinds of gross discrimination under the Delaware apportionment which do not exist in the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.923" offset="16952069">First, some senatorial districts have three, four, 10 and even 15 times the per capita representation of other districts in the same county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.630" offset="17002956">There's nothing similar to that in the federal arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.532" offset="17018525">Second is gross discrimination in the lower House, both between counties and between districts in different counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.438" offset="17058126">On the average, as I said a moment ago, the people of Kent County have twice the per capita representation in the lower House of the people in New Castle County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.440" offset="17098146">There's nothing in the Federal Constitution that contemplates that kind of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.808" offset="17123641">Third, a numerical majority in the Delaware Senate could come from districts containing only 28% of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.986" offset="17164392">There's nothing of that kind required or sanctioned by the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.338" offset="17193754">So we think that taking the apportionment that is before the Court and comparing it with the federal system is an utter lack of resemblance and all the argument about the federal analogy is utterly beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.829" offset="17259687">Appellants say in their reply brief, well, the issue of the federal analogy is inescapably in the case for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.388" offset="17297930">First, they say the legislature might have equalized the senatorial districts in each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.892" offset="17323948">Well, this case doesn't concern with what the legislature might have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.779" offset="17339517">It's concerned with what it did and then it says that the legislatures, second, might have followed the suggestion that we made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.092" offset="17372745">Well again, it didn't and we're not concerned with what might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.487" offset="17394375">Nor I submit made the court be concerned with any future apportionment that might be enacted by the Delaware Legislature that may or may not satisfy the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.841" offset="17447769">The decree leaves the legislature to adopt its own apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.564" offset="17466681">It doesn't forbid the adoption of a plan truly analogous to the Federal Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.452" offset="17486221">If it doesn't, then it will be time enough to adjudicate that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.021" offset="17504507">This Court does not sit and certainly in this field, I submit, should not undertake to render advisory opinions on hypothetical questions that are not here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4377.155" offset="17612967">Now, the second point and that is our argument that taking the case that is here, the apportionment of the Delaware Legislature violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it creates gross discrimination between persons and groups of persons without any support in policy whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.280" offset="17709516">We're contend here to take as appellants say they're content to take, the rule suggested by Baker and Carr to it that if the discrimination reflects no policy but simply arbitrary and capricious action then it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.401" offset="17794048">The findings of the District Court and the undisputed evidence, we think, demonstrate that this is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.156" offset="17829052">I don't want to take the time of the Court with a lot of figures because there's something that have to be again looked at and studied in order really to grasp them that if you were to look at the tables on pages 25 and again, over on 30 of our brief, you'd find that there is really the most enormous differences in the number of people in each district and remember that each district elects one representative or one senator as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.427" offset="17954126">For example in Sussex County, you find the 8th District has as fewest three -- just under 3000 people and the 10th has as many as 12, the 9th has four so your differences of 2-to-1, 3-to1, 4-to1.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.011" offset="18028419">Within Kent County, you find districts running up from 2, 3, and 4-to-1 up to a difference of 6-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.430" offset="18070110">Within the City of New Castle curiously, you find the difference as great as 3-to-1 -- I -- I said City of New Castle, I meant City of Wilmington and within the County of New Castle, you find ratios running up to 12-to-1 and of course, you find differences of the same order when they are taken across county whereas I was stating it simply between counties, at page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.595" offset="18186825">On page 30, we deal with the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.437" offset="18202185">You'll note that in New Castle County, the 7th Senatorial District has 4000 people and the 6th has 14,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.450" offset="18242205">The others run up to 63 to 64,000 people with a couple of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.396" offset="18273970">Kent County, there's a ratio of at least 3-to-1 and another 2-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.484" offset="18298316">Sussex County is a little bit better.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.211" offset="18309287">They are the worst ratio isn't quite as bad as 2-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.884" offset="18323916">If you compare them cross county, you find that the same number of senators are assigned to the 300,000 people in New Castle County as or assigned to the 61,000 people in Kent County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.042" offset="18384520">And remember, they are not assigned by county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.511" offset="18394446">Those figures show in average rather than specific comparisons because comparison can't be county against county.</text>

            <text syncTime="4652.013" offset="18712409">Certainly, we would always agree that if the matter of providing transcripts to the record on appeal to proper defendants in criminal cases came up and then majority of the legislature said, "We'll never stand for this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4758.226" offset="19137264">In the -- in this case, we didn't deal with it so explicitly in the earlier cases because the argument kept bringing out the points we have really dealt with, but that point is fully explained in our brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.420" offset="19194107">There are some other reasons assigned and I would like to try to deal with each of them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.910" offset="19232037">In the first place, it suggested that the apportionment is rational because of the work of the bipartisan committee, had all the virtues of the work of the federal constitutional convention and that indeed they pass through 13 steps of procedure in expounding this plan of apportionment, but of course, we're concerned with what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.961" offset="19332242">I have no desire to criticize the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.432" offset="19350110">They may have had all the virtues attributed to them, but it's the result that the Court was concerned itself with and similarly the procedure that it went through 13 steps seems hardly decisive for all unconstitutional legislation goes through a good number of steps in the legislature not all was a faithful 13 steps, but nevertheless, it does go through committees and resolutions imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.644" offset="19458988">We're told here substantively that one of the things that justifies the apportionment is that it is on a rational geographical basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.586" offset="19514786">Unfortunately, it has not been explained to us just what this rational geographical basis is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.358" offset="19549790">Looking at it and there's a map attached to the complaint so you can see the configuration of the district, there are seven within each county but I don't know why that's particularly rational anymore than they have five in one, eight in another and 12 in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.752" offset="19631397">Even within the counties, the districts are widely different in area and population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.013" offset="19652399">There seems to be no relationship between the area of the population that no significant topographical features as would explain to us at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.539" offset="19694508">The two floterial districts in Kent County are divided between what is said to be the Eastern and Western House but I don't suppose that that's meant to explain why one has placed as many people in it and therefore half the representation of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.233" offset="19765352">It's suggested the likelihood of population growth in the future would wipe out these inequities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.847" offset="19799834">Well, it might, but when the county has to increase 15-fold, and another one has to increase a 12-fold and another one has to increase 11-fold and many of them 8-fold, it seems to me that -- that hope that maybe it will someday in the hereafter workout fairly is not enough to justify in -- unfairness in the present choice of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.748" offset="19911429">Then it is said that this was compelled by time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.761" offset="19931491">Mr. Theisen has pointed out one answer to that and that is that the District Court taking the facts and provisions of the Delaware Constitution really acted quite reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.628" offset="19990946">Another answer, I suggest, is that when constitutional ranks are denied, it's not a sufficient answer to say, "Oh, we did it in a hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.072" offset="20032637">" The appellants are here arguing that this plan as a permanent continuing piece of legislation conforms to the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.593" offset="20078717">Indeed, they explain in answer to a question before the bench that they didn't want to moot the case, they didn't want to make this into stopgap legislation and enact another permanent end until they had their whack in having this one upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.340" offset="20137754">Well, then it must be judged as continuing permanent legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.154" offset="20161055">None of these explanations, I submit in conclusion, explain the gross inequalities that exist between the senatorial districts and the representative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.043" offset="20216539">Indeed, I have yet to hear the explanation that was going to be given to Justice Goldberg for the difference in size between the districts -- the senatorial districts in New Castle County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.757" offset="20271397">Finally, I want to say just a word with reference to the argument based on the early history of the Fourteenth Amendment and the early cases under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.103" offset="20336807">Now, their only relevance, as I see it, is to an attack upon Baker and Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.802" offset="20375573">I recognized that counsel claims that, but I cannot so the life of me saying what bearing the quotations from Minor and Happersett have or the references to the Fifteenth and Eighteenth Amendments have or to Fifteenth -- thank you, Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments have or that the quotations from Congressman Bingham have unless it is an argument that the Fourteenth Amendment has nothing to do with case -- with questions that have to do with voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.857" offset="20511828">Now, there it is all water long over the bend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.304" offset="20533561">It is but settled ever since Nixon and Herndon in 273 U.S. that the Fourteenth -- that the equal protection of the Fourteenth Amendment clause does have something to do with voting right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.602" offset="20590822">True, it is still up to the States to lay down the qualifications for voting, but the guarantee of equal protection applies to the opportunity to participate at primaries, to the right to have your vote counted equally with other votes so as to prevent against frauds, stuffing the ballot box and such to voting -- to having your vote counted as one vote in an election for Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.953" offset="20700223">And as I read the decision in Baker v. Carr, it applies to the claim of equality and the right to representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.136" offset="20736899">So that going back over that history, it seems to me quite unnecessary at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.480" offset="20770335">Now, appellant say that the references to the readmission of Florida and the other discussion of the Fourteenth Amendment is intended to show that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the principle one man, one vote to be applied to representation in both houses of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.909" offset="20859988">Certainly no such question is raised by this case and I think no such question is raised by any of the other cases that have been argued here during the past month.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.908" offset="20900007">Someday, that question may come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.445" offset="20910143">Someday it may have to be considered, but certainly Florida's Constitution, in terms of what was known about it when it came before the Congress in the 1860s, is no justification for what we know about the Delaware apportionment today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.169" offset="20989032">All that appeared on the face of the Florida Constitution was that every county in the lower House was assured at least one representative and then remaining representatives were to be apportioned per capita and nothing appeared on the face of it about the upper House, but quite plainly that isn't altogether a different case than is before us in terms of the Delaware situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.309" offset="21105643">I think one another thing should be said about the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.075" offset="21132706">It is not quite as easy as appellants' quotations from the objection to the readmission of Florida and the reply by Benjamin Butler make out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.935" offset="21196131">In the first place, there was considerable amount of debate in between and while Congressman Farnsworth of Illinois, of course said what Colonel Wiener said he said, he made a great many other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.190" offset="21253183">Congressman Butler took out for all the arguments that have been made by Congressman Farnsworth and at least one other representative and answered each of them one by one except this matter of apportionment and it was after that that he said, "All these matters have been going into by our committees."</text>

            <text syncTime="5355.834" offset="21527782">But it had repeatedly rejected and this is stated in about the same part of the debate that the quotations are taken from a little bit late.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.384" offset="21569891">The thrust of the argument for readmitting Florida was I would say two-fold or two points in addition to that mentioned by Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.766" offset="21611478">The first was what else are we going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.346" offset="21621823">We've got to get on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.405" offset="21629973">We can't remand Florida back to the State as territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.280" offset="21645542">What else are we going to do but to take or despite the committee's dissatisfaction and that's what the committee recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.306" offset="21673650">And the second thing was that we need Florida in for the purpose of having the Fourteenth Amendment ratified so as well are your doubts and vote to have Florida readmitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.018" offset="21736448">In other words, it comes to what Mr. Justice Douglas suggested if I heard him right this morning to words that there was a political decision to readmit Florida, governmental decision, I mean political in that sense and not a scrutinizing of everything Florida had done or stood for with the idea of writing it as a rubric on the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment yet to be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.241" offset="21845326">So that we think to preclude that the arguments are directed to the Fourteenth Amendment insofar as they attempt to overrule all the cases from Nixon and Condon and Nixon and Herndon down to Gray and Sanders come much too late and that so far as they are directed to sustaining this Delaware apportionment, they simply missed the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="5466.123" offset="21968938">If the Court please, there is a tradition at the bar of this Court and on one occasion when the lateness Mr. Justice McReynolds asked the question, he was answered by the familiar, "I am coming to that Your Honor" and he replied rather testily, "You're here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.593" offset="22050753">The question of the Senate in the Delaware Constitution is here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.141" offset="22084921">" Two of the judges below concurred in saying that it was impossible, it was impermissible to deviate from the population factor as the major factor in apportioning the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.915" offset="22144063">Judge Biggs at page A49 and Judge Wright at page A62, that problem is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.651" offset="22183037">Now, what I have talked about as the federal analogy what everyone else has talked about federal analogy means basically a one house not apportioned according to population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.609" offset="22246881">Now, the two ways of doing that within the basic framework of the Delaware amendment, one is to have all the senators at large and the other is to have the senatorial districts equalized within the counties and the Solicitor General has said that you cannot expect anybody to vote away his seat, entrenched power is too strong and that's the reason why nothing has been equalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.677" offset="22367148">I suggest it is not very helpful particularly with those who -- on the part of those who represent the United States to deal with questions of this seriousness in terms of epithets and motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.594" offset="22418766">The fact of the matter is that when the equalizing bill which we have in our -- in the appendix to the reply brief got to the Senate, the Delaware Senate on the very day that the circuit justice stayed the -- the injunction, it passed unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.124" offset="22492850">Let's not have any talk about entrenched power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.967" offset="22504239">They were prepared to equalize the -- equalize the Senate and perhaps vote away their own seats, but the State --</text>

            <text syncTime="5625.130" offset="22604967">Yes, they passed it and then they didn't do anything more because the case was on appeal, the injunction had been stayed and Judge Biggs himself had said at the trial, "I hope this case will be appealed to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.935" offset="22660138">" But the Delaware General Assembly of the State of Delaware is powerless to amend its Constitution if this injunction now stay a pending appeal remains in effect because if the Delaware General Assembly sometime in 1964 as soon as it -- as long as it sits proceeds to do whatever this Court's decision says is necessary, it can't do it by way of constitutional amendment because no subsequent General Assembly can ever be elected.</text>

            <text syncTime="6262.616" offset="25154832">The whole of that is outlawed under the Equal Protection Clause means a construction of that clause directly of variance with what the way Congress construed it in the case of Florida and South Carolina and Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.246" offset="25209375">And Mr. Cox’s the arguments here about the Congress not scrutinizing the Florida Constitution are just like Mr. Rankins in U.S. v. Florida but they didn't look the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.808" offset="25259635">And it would be a construction also of the Equal Protection Clause that would repeat the tragic era of the Due Process Clause construction that’s been so recently reviewed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6309.479" offset="25342286">But at one fell swoop, it would -- not on the basis of experience put overnight and it would really, it would really be amending the Constitution with a cleaver and what would be the result?</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.719" offset="25391292">I think the necessary, the inescapable result is that it would reduce the States of the union to mere geographical subdivisions when their -- their instrument of Government for constructing their legislature is subjected, it can be subjected at the instance of a single disgruntled citizen to a scrutiny far more searching then any of its legislation and in the process would be hurried and harried and sneered up by those who represent the United States as completely inadequate (Inaudible) efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.418" offset="25546041">Now, I don't think, I don't think that the States -- the relationship of the States to the nation properly can be the same as the relationship of municipalities to a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.655" offset="25611034">That would be the inevitable consequence if a State is denied in the right to apportion, to mold, to construct, to -- its legislature on the federal pattern and the necessary consequence would be with that kind of a holding and the republic as it has existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.904" offset="25683968">Our federate republic as it has existed for 175 years would no longer be a federated republic.</text>
