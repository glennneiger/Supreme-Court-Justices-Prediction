            <text syncTime="680.522" offset="2825488">For 1956, Mechling's operation was 91.9%, its average fully distributed cost for the transportation of car from the six most competitive points to Chicago was so many mills or 4.4 cents per 100 pounds which is the comparable figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.630" offset="2901870">These expenses are about 10 cents less than the New York Central's average fully distributed cost of 14.33 and 13.57 per 100 pounds on 50-ton and 55-ton loads respectively for 46.4 miles computed by the protesters.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.908" offset="2978983">According to Mechling, this difference of approximately 10 cents represents its inherent low cost advantage which must be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.251" offset="3016391">Now, the Commission didn't dispute that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.131" offset="3023914">This is what it said, "The barge carrier is not entitled under the transfer -- under the Act to have its rates protected from a competing mode of transportation whereas in this instance, the railroad's efforts to secure traffic do not amount to a destructive competitive practice."</text>
            <text syncTime="746.943" offset="3091101">I submit that was the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.961" offset="3099251">It is the only finding the Commission could make because that was the whole evidence, Mr. Justice White.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.555" offset="3197576">The simple average cost of the 50-ton loads, the Commission says on the preceding page with the same qualification that we put in the evidence and that was all the evidence that was, a 50 to a range up to 9.66 cents instead of 5.5.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.132" offset="3267897">And on the weighted average with the extra 5 tons was between 8.56 and 8.57.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.219" offset="3296214">That's on page 25 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.613" offset="3305827">Now, this evidence in the Commission's findings that it is the evidence that is flat finding that there is the fact so far as the fully distributed cost are concerned which I first read, completely exploded the claim on which the railroads relied at the hearing that new 5.5 cent rail rate was a reasonably compensative charge for the service performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.333" offset="3404675">These below cost what a competitive rail rate produced a heavy diversion of corn from the barge of the rail whose earlier stages are described that, in our brief, diversion has continued so that from over 34 million bushels to Chicago by barge in 1957, the first year, the new rail rate was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.131" offset="3487848">The barge go on traffic to Chicago had flown by 1963 to only 16 million to 54 pounds are less than half according to the 1963 statistics of the Chicago Board of Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.160" offset="3539989">But we brought in mind that the below-cost 5.5-cent rail charge applied only to that part of the traffic that is milled in transit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.302" offset="4372564">The eastern line -- eastern carrier picked back to New York Central without any published tariff on it, 13 cents out of that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.691" offset="4410180">Look at the consequence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.848" offset="4418748">The consequence is that the actual remuneration of the eastern carrier when it took this rail-arrived grain to Chicago was -- then got 29 cents for that service, less 13 cents, only the difference, what is -- 26 -- 36.5-cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.582" offset="4513729">But when it was barge-arrived grain in Chicago, the eastern carrier got the full 49.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.168" offset="4552077">The consequence of which is that the -- under this rate, the eastern carrier is moving rail-arrived grain to the East for 13 cents less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.388" offset="4608920">Then it gets -- when it moves barge-arrived grain to Chicago to the East which is precisely what this Court condemn in the first Mechling case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.462" offset="8321233">Our appeal presents but a single issue and that issue was separate and distinct from the issues which are presented by the Mechling appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.623" offset="8377866">And when and if this case goes back to the Commission, we certainly will not give up those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.190" offset="8400123">But we are arguing only one in this Court and the -- that issue is this, whether the Interstate Commerce Commission can enter an order granting the railroad's relief from the long- and short-haul requirement of Section 4 of the Act without considering and making findings of the Board of Trade's contention that the rates for which authority is sought would cause unjust discrimination and undue prejudice against Chicago corn merchants and against Chicago as a locality in violation of Section 3, Paragraph (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.856" offset="8550797">Our position is that the Commission cannot grant such fourth-section relief without passing on the merits of the Board of Trade's contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.545" offset="9157569">First, it is essential that the Court bear in mind that we are dealing with a question of transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.718" offset="9178258">And what that essentially means is that you take two separate movements, you tie them together with a transit privilege and you treat them as if they were one single movement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.445" offset="9357145">And Union Hill is located just west of Kankakee on the Kankakee Belt Line.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.845" offset="9414719">They range all the way from the big corn merchants like the Continental Grain Company, Cargill, down to a very small corn merchants and -- and of all sizes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2359.544" offset="9541569">The elevator at Union Hill, knowing prior to December 15th, 1956 that its rate to Chicago was 19 cents a hundred pounds, will look at the Chicago bid and see how much he will net at his elevator in Union Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.843" offset="9598725">If he accepts the bid and ships the corn to Chicago, the Chicago buyer will be the one who actually pays the freight but he will -- he will deduct it from the invoice price so that the Union Hill elevator man will get what the Chicago price less the freight to Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.123" offset="9679914">Now, the Chicago merchant, say, puts that in his elevator, he stores it in an elevator and he ships it to New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.933" offset="9971127">Now, in -- the main thing to remember about that is that the grain products rate was .5-cent higher than the grain rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.597" offset="10017729">The corn products were .5-cent higher than corn and that has been the feature of the eastern rate structure from Illinois to the East ever since 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.568" offset="10057644">Now, the Kankakee processor, essentially, the same thing happened to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.458" offset="10081155">If he processed it and send it to the East, he also had a through rate of 68.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.356" offset="10108844">Now, this brings us to another basic feature of the grain rate adjustment which was this, that this is a group adjustment and that means that you don't take individual points necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.856" offset="10158791">The rate applies from point-to-point but within a -- an origin group which branch again from small origin groups to extremely large origin groups, the rate is the same from that group to New York via a number of routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.137" offset="10227963">It can go via Chicago, it can go via Kankakee, it could go via Danville, which is South of Kankakee and it could via Paris which is South of Danville.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.978" offset="10271326">All of those points have large corn processors located at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.524" offset="10289507">So no matter who got the corn, the merchant or the processor, the rates were all equal with the exception that the product's rates were always .5-cent higher than the whole grain rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.287" offset="10340498">So everybody had a chance to buy the corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.149" offset="10351992">Now, I will not go into the mechanics of handling barge corn except to say this, that since the decision of this Court in the Mechling case in 330 U.S., barge corn -- barge-arrived corn at Chicago moves to the East on the same reshipping rates as rail-arrived corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.320" offset="10432658">So at this time, the rate was 49 cents on corn and 4.5 cents on corn products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.567" offset="10465677">And if a merchant bought the -- the corn and went to the East, he paid 49 cents which was the same balance as he paid out of the single factor rate from Union Hill and if a processor bought the corn, he paid 49.5 cents and that again, the processor at Kankakee, the processor at Danville, the processor at Paris could all buy that corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.789" offset="10574555">Now, we come to what happened on December the 15th, 1956.</text>
