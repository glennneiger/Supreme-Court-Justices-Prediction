            <label>Mr. Eberhard P. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="24.606" offset="201749">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.826" offset="218676">It will be recalled that the appellant in this case is the District or Prosecuting Attorney for the Parish of Orleans which is coextensive with the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.784" offset="262457">That when he took office something over two years ago, he launched an attack on a backlog of criminal cases awarding -- awaiting trial and at the same time embarked on a campaign against commercialized vice in the Bourbon Street district of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.700" offset="350124">That a dispute arose between himself and the judges of the criminal court after he had been in office for sometime as to his use of certain funds for these vice investigation conditions that the judges adapted a rule that five of them would have to concur in approving his vouchers for these expenses as against the statute which provided that any one judge could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.010" offset="479378">That they then, adapted a further rule allowing him no further expenses for that purpose out of this fund that a recently retired judge made a derogatory statement concerning him, which was published in the press that he was asked to -- by reporters if he had any comment to make and in reply, made the statement which is the issue of this criminal proceeding for defamation under the Louisiana Defamation Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.026" offset="619499">He stated that the judges were themselves responsible for the backlog of cases that they were not working, that they were taking excessive vacations, that they were endeavoring specifically to block his investigations of commercialized vice which "raises interesting questions about the racketeer influences on our eight vacation-minded judges".</text>
            <text syncTime="156.789" offset="730572">And this proceeding arose out of that on a petition by the judges to the Attorney General of the State, requesting him to institute criminal proceedings, charges against the appellant under the Louisiana Criminal Defamation Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.385" offset="812910">And on the same day that he did that, the Supreme Court of Louisiana appointed the judge from another district to hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.467" offset="845197">Trial by jury was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.554" offset="857631">Motion for trial by jury was denied under the Louisiana statute which provides the juries are not to be used in misdemeanor cases, this thing a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.856" offset="906846">And his place properly presented under the First and Fourteenth Amendments were overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.745" offset="930356">He was found guilty and the judge said if he would be less than frank, if he did not say that the defamatory statement might not have been issued without some provocation and under the mitigating circumstances, as the judge quoted, fine -- levity fine of $1000 or in the alternative, a jail sentence of four months.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.267" offset="1052400">If -- when it was on the Federal Constitution, yes, because the Louisiana Constitution specifically provides that you may not have a jury in a misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.888" offset="1110915">It should probably have been predicated on the First and Fourteenth, that's the position we take here.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.980" offset="1135261">The Supreme Court of Louisiana did, specifically, passed on the point that it was not necessary to furnish a jury in this case under the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.752" offset="1186356">The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed the conviction passing on the specific constitutional issues which had been raised and relying primarily on this Court's opinion in Beauharnais versus Illinois that libelous utterances are not within the area of constitutionally protected speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.900" offset="1979016">I think its Numbers 24 and 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.004" offset="1991346">They're coming up as a part of this set of cases now, Cox versus the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.352" offset="2028753">Now, arising out of that case, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, a few days ago, denied a rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.648" offset="2058010">And I think this is particularly significant in two cases involving prosecutions under the same defamation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.261" offset="2100433">A Negro minister was stated to have defamed a court, that's a judge, and the District Attorney in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by casting aspersions on the Court's conduct with regard to prosecution of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.898" offset="2179009">And he was prosecuted under the Defamation Statute, convicted, fined in each case, the full limit of the -- allowed under the statute of $3000 plus one year in jail on each case, making two years plus $6000 and then required to serve an additional two years if he didn't pay the $6000.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.656" offset="2286007">Now, the case came up to the Supreme Court which wrote a considerable dissertation on the effect of this Court's decision in the New York Times case, stating that its Defamation Statute was entirely valid and this prosecution was entirely valid under that statute but reversed, and then after that, in a short part of the decision, reversed the decision on the grounds that the District Attorney had not recused himself because he was in a sense, a party to this prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.497" offset="6661308">Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.468" offset="6689207">I would like to say with all due respect to Colonel Deutsch that he has confused the facts in this matter, in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.674" offset="6730062">And with the Court's permission, I'd like a few minutes to tell you exactly what the facts are and exactly how they came about and I'll do it very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.453" offset="6769142">And I think that you will find that the record bears me out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.777" offset="6786487">Where the defendant in this case robbed the District Attorney, he made a public statement that these fines and forfeitures was -- should be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.326" offset="6820655">After he took office, he met with the judges and this is in our supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.992" offset="6843329">He met with the judges and discussed the matter with them and agreed that a better system should be worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.929" offset="6883140">Upon the misrepresentations of the District Attorney, the defendant in this case to one of the retired judges over the payment of rob, are copied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.617" offset="6917831">This judge wanted verification of the price of the copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.224" offset="6928280">He was refused the approval of this expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.822" offset="6942699">The fines and forfeitures, goes into a fund handled by the District Attorney in Orleans Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.714" offset="6962239">In order to get money out of that fund, he sends a copy of it and hand it over to city hall which is approved by the arbitrator and then he takes it to one of the judges to have it signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.663" offset="7009991">After this misrepresentation, there were several other misrepresentations and this is all brought out in the record and in the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.619" offset="7037889">So the judges, in order that they were -- couldn't be played against to one another, they met and adopted this so called 5 by 8 rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.928" offset="7075088">Now, he knew all this at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.827" offset="7086686">He knew it when he campaigned, he knew it afterwards and he knew that the statements he was making about being a -- so called being a black, by vice and so forth were in error because of the fact that from the time that they met with the 5 by 8 rule at which he was present, the judges approved some close to $50,000 of money for him to use in so called, vice investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.486" offset="7193266">In addition to that, he had 12 policemen assigned to him by the chief of police and this is in the record, who were paid by the city, not out of his payroll, who worked at his direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.026" offset="7243525">Therefore, there was no possible way that these judges could've blocked any investigation that he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.234" offset="7264319">He had all kind of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.831" offset="7270693">He had all kind of personnel including his own investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.755" offset="7286366">So when he made the statement that they blocked his investigators, that is not true and he made that statement deliberately knowing it to be false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.464" offset="7321266">Now, let's talk about vacations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.789" offset="7330565">He said that they weren't working that the jail was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.198" offset="7344149">Well, the District Attorney in the State of Louisiana controls the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.559" offset="7357628">He determines who, where and when they will be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.588" offset="7369749">The judges have nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.999" offset="7379362">Furthermore, in Louisiana courts, just as this Court, does not work on Saturdays and Sundays, that's 104 days out of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.237" offset="7416351">The Constitution provides -- its courts would take -- criminal courts would take two and a half months vacation which is another 75 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.273" offset="7448430">There are 17 legal holidays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.720" offset="7454281">You add those up and it comes to 196, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.103" offset="7467760">He claimed that they were taking 206 days vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.235" offset="7480299">Well, they had to take 197 days vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.979" offset="7495241">There's no that they can do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.326" offset="7504645">And I think that this Court realizes and appreciates that while you have a Criminal District Court without law clerks and without a library, that it certainly going to take them some time in addition to sitting, to look up the various legal points that come before that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.959" offset="7563160">Now, knowing all that, he became irritated apparently to retired judge's statement over the question to this rack and he called a news conference on November the 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.360" offset="7624808">And he just said, "Everything in the world," but the chief thing that he said was that "all of this so-called blocking his investigation and taking vacations and so forth, that this raised interesting questions of racketeering influence and no other questions."</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.621" offset="7705893">Now, after that happened, the judges filed an affidavit against him, charging him with defamation under the same statute that he is now being prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.645" offset="7749987">He had one of his assistants walk into court and dismissed that, which the District Attorney has the right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.093" offset="7779767">Now, as I said to this Court previously and I stated in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.889" offset="7794918">Here was a situation where judges were accused to being racketeers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.097" offset="7815711">And I agree with the Court, on one of the justices that made a remark that if he's guilty of that, he's got no business being a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.590" offset="7845700">So the -- the eight judges petitioned to me because I have authority over District Attorneys to come in and prosecute him on a bill of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.189" offset="7884152">And it was our position that if what he was saying was true, then it didn't have anyone fit to hold office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.593" offset="7905782">So I filed a bill of information because I thought that it was my duty and I had to do it because that is the only way that the State can prosecute an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.883" offset="7942875">It's got to be done in the name of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.983" offset="7951339">If you know I, if I walk over and I slap you and you filed a charge against me for simple battery, it's got to be in the name of the State because the State stands for law and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.656" offset="7990000">You can't take law into your own hands, such as your risk as about seeing he cheats at the golf course, what does that man going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.065" offset="8015600">Is he going to take a gun and go kill this fellow?</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.500" offset="8025422">You can't do that in -- in our particular society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.022" offset="8039424">So continue -- continuing, I filed a bill of information against him to give him the opportunity to prove his charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.474" offset="8069308">After the bill of information was filed on November the 13th to 22nd, I think it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.803" offset="8094595">He made a speech, a catholic school meeting in New Orleans and he went through the same charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.189" offset="8124165">He accused these judges of being influenced by racketeers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.626" offset="8137853">He says there's no other reason and he said that he was going to keep shouting to the public because he had no other allies because the other public officials belong to the association of armed robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.039" offset="8187486">And incidentally, in the meantime, he had told several reports all of which is in the record, that it was nothing but a racket, that the only way he could put these sacred house back to work was to tell the public about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.414" offset="8233044">When I tell you that the record bears out, that he knew that there wasn't any truth to what he was saying and that he didn't have any reasonable idea or remote consideration that what he was saying was the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.989" offset="8623313">One involves the right to picket in the City of Baton Rouge which is not connected with this case at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.010" offset="8647450">The other one involves the right to be issued a parade for in it by the City of Baton Rouge, which doesn't involve this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.692" offset="8678170">And the Cox which was decided by the Supreme Court which is not reported and I looked just before I came and stopped before it even in advanced sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.011" offset="8711398">He was charged with defamation of a district judge for this reason, that he said it was common knowledge that oppressed Negroes who appeared in Judge Blodgett's Court had to pay a fee which he knew it to Judge Blodgett benefit to keep from going to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.829" offset="8778689">Now, that's what he was prosecuted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.122" offset="8787884">And one of the defenses among others that he made was that he had the right to say anything he wanted about a public official because he was protected by the First and the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.298" offset="8836577">And our Supreme Court went into this matter very thoroughly and here's what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.785" offset="8858520">It says, "We cannot agree with appellant therefore that the New York Times case," talking about the Sullivan case, "its authority for holding that if conditioned that the publication or expression must be made in a reasonable belief of its truth, the privilege to apply violates to constitutional safeguards in the First Amendment."</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.079" offset="8923721">We view our statute as being fully in accord with the New York Times pronouncement, conceding that case of civil libel is applicable to our criminal defamation legislation, and it's fully safeguarding those accused under it in contravention with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.882" offset="8990908">Our statute permits the qualified privilege to exist regardless of whether the publication was true or false when it is a comment made in a reasonable belief of its truth upon the conduct of a question in respect to public affairs and in such case, actual malice must be proved by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.165" offset="9060080">Our criminal statutory requirements for proving actual malice are in accord with those set out in the New York Times case for civil libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.349" offset="9092786">Our statute is clearly constitutional when measured by the standards set out in the New York Times case to satisfy the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.239" offset="9124342">And then it goes on of course arguing arguendo and says this, "In our opinion, our statute is not for public," and this is the same statute that he's prosecuted here, "is not for public to the -- poignant to the First Amendment simply because it recognizes that the public have an interest in the maintenance of the public act with public men."</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.765" offset="9202395">Public affairs could not be conducted by a man of honor with a view to the welfare of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.979" offset="9223293">If it taxed upon them, it could be made at will, distracted of -- distractive of the honor and character and made wholly without foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.675" offset="9254118">Our statute sufficiently protects those honestly criticizing the public officials as to their official conduct to satisfy the First Amendment when it properly forbids unjustified malicious attacks upon them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.505" offset="12773439">Now, when we say the influence by racketeers that means that he's influenced necessarily by a man of ill repute, and it indicates of course, that he could have taken a pride.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.796" offset="12810533">And then to further show his state of mind, we never did have the opportunity to probe him of his state of mind because he didn't take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.153" offset="12839999">But then, immediately after the charges were filed, he makes another statement in which he says it's a racket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.491" offset="12865285">He says, "If I had to do it over again, I do it, I would -- I'd have no regret.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.667" offset="12882004">I'd continue to do the same thing."</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.764" offset="12890467">He continues to call the sacred cows, he continues to malign him, he continues to say that it's nothing but racketeering questions and influence that there's no other question involved, that they're an association of armed robbers and just a few days before his trial, he again repeated the fact that these judges were influenced by racketeers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.718" offset="12966222">So what you assume and all of that was introduced, of course, to show the question of malice which was the only way that we could have proved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.390" offset="13000913">So when you lump all that together, I don't see how any courts could find and I think the district would quite properly found that these statements were malicious because we proved that they were not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.319" offset="13048665">We put the judges on the stand and asked them, "Did you read the statement of November 2nd?"</text>
