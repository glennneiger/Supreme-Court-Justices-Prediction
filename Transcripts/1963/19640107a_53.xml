            <label>Mr. Philip B. Heymann</label>
            <text syncTime="13.939" offset="159117">Now, this -- this case is in most respect similar to Tilton or at least that's how I intended to begin the argument though I can see that -- that will require some arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.910" offset="215019">Brooks was an apprentice when he went off to the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.736" offset="230275">He was an apprentice machinist not a carman.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.582" offset="245739">The apprenticeship program consists of 1040 days of work plus successful completion of a correspondence course.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.135" offset="279907">After 1040 days of work, the apprentice automatically obtains the status of a journeyman machinist but he doesn't obtain machinist seniority until -- unless he's in the language of the contract continued in the employment in the language of common sense employed for one day as a journeyman machinist.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.403" offset="380949">He has to be employed for one day after completion of 1040-day apprenticeship period.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.224" offset="412296">He does -- the journeyman machinist does, however, have a right to do work of a journeyman ahead of anyone who has less status than a journeyman, less than upgraded apprentices.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.829" offset="466735">I'd -- I'll remind you of that when we get later on in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.692" offset="486170">Brooks was called away as an apprentice from Monroe, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.277" offset="500485">He returned to Monroe, Louisiana and worked there in his -- after his military service and worked there on his apprenticeship until the -- there was a layoff at Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.522" offset="549491">The Monroe was actually disappearing as a shop where work was being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.237" offset="576345">He transferred to St. Louis where the railroad was calling for apprentices and a year later in the summer of 1955, he trans -- I think it was 1955, he transferred with the Railroad's permission to North Little Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.082" offset="639666">He completed his 1040 days at North Little Rock and was thereupon assigned -- he immediately went to work but he claimed his seniority date which would have been his, had he been continuously employed in his apprenticeship program during the period he was away in military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.189" offset="732139">The railroad rejected this.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.339" offset="748753">The District Court this time found in favor of the veteran saying that his process would have been -- now, every step was a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.189" offset="792116">The Court of Appeals again for the Eight Circuit reversed this time merely citing its Tilton opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.190" offset="820120">It relied on the fact that obtaining work as a journeyman for a day was not absolutely certain and foreseeable as the ground for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.504" offset="873409">I've said that in most respect, this case is in our view similar to Tilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.978" offset="899323">As in Tilton, we rely and deal for the proposition that the veteran can claim as a matter of right what would have been his had he merely been continuously on the job and at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.364" offset="952822">We say that Brooks' job was the job of being an apprentice and had he been continuously on the job, he would have had the seniority date he claims here.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.715" offset="1002245">It's true, as my discussion would -- in line of my discussion with Justice White that he had to complete a correspondence course.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.150" offset="1043937">However, we do not see any reason for treating this part of his job, a required correspondence course, as different from any other part.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.526" offset="1089494">We think that continuous employment includes the right to be treated as continually measuring up to accept its standards for the job, and we think that accepted standards for the job of apprentice is accepted progress is -- is expected progress in learning during your apprenticeship and is satisfactory completion of whatever correspondence course is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.284" offset="1196492">I'd like to make an alternative argument to that though on this point on the correspondence course.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.624" offset="1221883">We would argue that a veteran has a right to be treated as -- at a later date as if he had passed a qualifying test at an earlier date, once he's passed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.151" offset="1271933">Now, let me step back on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.960" offset="1287189">There's no question between any parties, I don't think that -- that a veteran who says and makes out a claim that by seniority alone would have been -- he would have been entitled to fill a vacancy during his absence, is entitled to have that position on his return.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.829" offset="1358660">I think everybody agrees on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.483" offset="1373288">Now, the --</text>

            <text syncTime="343.323" offset="1476629">You assume that he elected to give up seniority in the lower job in order to get the higher position but anyway, that is conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.242" offset="1508289">Now the question is what happens if the employer says the senior man in category one is entitled to a promotion to group two if he has vision of 20/50 or no better or no worst.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.253" offset="1656351">Now, we would say the same thing of any objective tests, it doesn't make a difference to us whether it says he has to have an IQ of 100 or whether it says he has to satisfactory -- satisfactorily pass any objective test, any test that doesn't involve management -- the -- the marking of which did not involve management discretion and we would treat the correspondence course that way even if we weren't -- if even if we didn't simply sweep it in with --</text>
