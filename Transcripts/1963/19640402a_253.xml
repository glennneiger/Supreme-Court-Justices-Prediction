            <label>Mr. Murray A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="21.792" offset="190568">-- certiorari from the Second Circuit which had sustained a final order of deportation of the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.207" offset="228185">The case is here in connection with the habeas corpus proceeding challenging that final order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.809" offset="262562">And more particularly, the determination by the Second Circuit involved two components.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.443" offset="301119">First, there was a finding that the petitioner who is a native born American had been expatriated and lost his sole American citizenship rendered stateless.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.388" offset="372903">As a result of his alleged military service in the Cuban Rebel Army after January of 1959 and until May of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.823" offset="418670">This expatriation was set to follow from the application of Section 349 (a) (3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.551" offset="469556">The Court of Appeals further found that the petitioner, having first lost his American citizenship and rendered an alien, and have been passed in this condition before he reentered the United States in July of 1960, that he was an alien at that time and therefore was required to have the requisite entry documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.133" offset="587943">And since he did not have such documents at the time that he returned to his native country, he was an excludable alien and for this reason, the court below held that the petitioner was not only an alien but a deportable alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.928" offset="663071">I shall be confining my discussion here today to two principal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.284" offset="692537">The first is the constitutionality of Section 349 (a) (3) as it was applied to the petitioner and secondly, the question of his deportability even assuming him to have been an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.372" offset="752828">I may say to the Court that there are many other questions which are argued in the brief, but I think this to be the key questions and I would prefer to use my time in the discussion of these two and leave the other questions so the treatment to be found in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.054" offset="831613">Since I've confined the questions which I shall discuss to these two principal matters, I shall confine my discussion of the facts to those of record which are relevant to these questions and those facts are largely not in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.408" offset="888978">Marks was born in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.880" offset="902875">He went to Cuba sometime in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.212" offset="920221">While there, he joined the Castro forces in the hills and fought with the revolutionary forces against Batista.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.001" offset="959404">In the course of this military activity, he rose to the rank of captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.125" offset="987826">Now, I should make clear that no part of the disability which he now suffers, derives from his service in the revolutionary army because Section 349 (a) (3) provides that there shall be law -- a loss of American nationality as a result of service in the armed forces of a foreign state, provided that there shall not first have been specific authorization by the Secretaries of Defense and State to engage in such military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.879" offset="1130872">Apparently under the statute, engaging in military activity on behalf of a revolutionary force doesn't constitute military service on behalf of a foreign state and therefore, it does not result in expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.039" offset="1187506">Consequently, the critical portion of his service is a period after January 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.072" offset="1215613">This was after Batista had fallen and the Castro forces became the provisional and subsequently, I take it, the accepted Government of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.852" offset="1258768">The petitioner remained in the rebel army during this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.456" offset="1277158">There is a great deal of dispute in the record whether the rebel army at that time was an armed force as it is defined under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.698" offset="1310177">A great deal of argument in the record as to whether Marks himself, engaged in any military service during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.878" offset="1342882">I shall bypass that except to mention one phase of that service because I'm just sure as I'm standing here that the -- my adversary will make reference to the fact that for a period of four or five months, after January of 1959, Marks supervised execution activities on behalf of the rebel army after there had been convictions by military tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.489" offset="1445282">The other fact which is not serious --</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="347.962" offset="1495228">He was in the States at that time, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.914" offset="1503065">He had been wounded in the course of his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.547" offset="1517589">He came back to the States in November of 1958 for medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.439" offset="1537128">And sometime between January 2nd and January 9th, I'm not sure of the date, he returned to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.791" offset="1562520">His testimony was that he returned for the sake of reunion with the man with whom he had fought and in addition, because he had been promised land and an opportunity to develop a farm of his own there, this was among the promises of agrarian reform which had been made by Castro.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.756" offset="1626363">And he has asserted this as the reasons for his return in January of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.066" offset="1647679">He remained in Cuba, if Your Honor pleases, until May of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.454" offset="1665233">When according to his testimony, various anti-communist activities in which he had engaged, had caused him to lose favor with the Castro regime and he said he was in fear of the Cuban secret police and fled the country on May of 1960 and subsequently arrived by way of Mexico, on July 22, 1960 in the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.760" offset="1830431">This doesn't appear in the record but I think I can tell Your Honor that he is of German descent.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.595" offset="1861778">The other fact of record which I think will not be controverted is that there was never any renunciation on the part of the petitioner, of either his American citizenship or his American allegiance, quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.063" offset="1923636">So far as the record speaks to that matter, it is quite clear that he never intended to renounce his American citizenship or his American allegiance.For example, he was -- because of the services to the revolutionary movement, he was eligible for Cuban citizenship if he had chosen to avail himself of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.833" offset="1998660">He never did so far as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.931" offset="2007124">As a matter of fact, the immigration service and the courts below acknowledged that he is stateless as a result of the judgment of the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.324" offset="2044635">He never took an oath of allegiance to Cuba so far as the record shows and he denies it as part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.478" offset="2073266">During the period of his activities following January 1959 in the rebel army, on frequent occasion, he landed -- he led A to the FBI, to the CIA, to the American consulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.962" offset="2123212">This too was not disputed in the record, nor is it disputed then in so doing, he sometimes subjected himself to personal jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.337" offset="2156753">And when in February of 1960, he was handed a notice from the State Department that his military service in Cuba, resulted in his denationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.914" offset="2191026">He promptly protested it in a press conference which was widely reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.418" offset="2217044">As I have said, he left the country, Cuba, May of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.045" offset="2231568">He came back to this country in July of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.894" offset="2250898">His experience here was uneventful until January 25th of 1961, when two officers of the immigration service came to an apartment where he was staying presumably who questioned him.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.873" offset="2306905">Now, the exact basis for the questioning is in controversy in the record and I will not go into the details of that except to tell you that after first being interviewed at 8 o'clock in this apartment, he then went to the immigration service officers in New York at 9 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.889" offset="2374928">There, he was questioned for a period of approximately five hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.165" offset="2392064">At the end of the period of questioning, a statement was prepared for him in the handwriting of one of the agents, containing a -- a narrative form of statement rather than question and answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.196" offset="2436159">Much of the language in that statement was the language of the investigator rather than of Marks' and then at least one particular, the statement was holding inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.052" offset="2479626">That statement was then submitted to Marks to sign, he signed it and he was promptly then advised for the first time that he was under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.831" offset="2510660">He was taken to the federal detention headquarters in New York and placed a maximum security and there, he remained for a period of approximately nine months when for the first time, we were able to obtain bail upon the institution of the present habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.992" offset="2575339">There were hearings before a special inquiry officer that ended on April 6 and that inquiry officer took until the end of May to render his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.423" offset="2613060">And throughout this period of time, Marks was detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.439" offset="2625076">An application was made for his release on habeas corpus, it was denied, pending exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.888" offset="2654960">Applications were made to the Attorney General of the United States for his release pending his -- pending the determination of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.660" offset="2682023">That was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.730" offset="2690278">An appeal was taken to the Board of Immigration Appeals, they affirmed the order of deportation and finally we were able to begin these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.425" offset="2725073">Initially, the District Court Judge fixed bail of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.616" offset="2741791">The petitioner couldn't raise that kind of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.144" offset="2751927">It was subsequently reduced, bail was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.540" offset="2765511">In October, he was released and he is out on bail at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.271" offset="2784423">The District Court found that the finding of alien -- of alienate was warranted under Section 349 (a) (3), but held that he was not deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.867" offset="2826846">The Court of Appeals reversed on the second phase, it held that not only was Marks an alien and stateless, but he is deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.063" offset="2871672">And this therefore, represents the first instance of a case before this Court of a native born American who has never voluntarily renounced his American citizenship and never acquire the citizenship of another country, being found to be stateless and deportable to any country who is willing to accept him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="729.424" offset="3021093">There were two grounds asserted for his deportability by the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.457" offset="3037184">First, that at the time of his entry in this country in 1960, he was an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.575" offset="3061635">The theory was that he denationalized himself automatically by this foreign military service and from that moment on, although I don't know whether it's the first moment of that service or the last moment of that service, whichever moment it maybe, he was then denationalized an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.968" offset="3127254">Now, when he came into the country at that time, he had a background of a prior conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.167" offset="3155989">So they said he was an excludable alien because of this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.285" offset="3172498">They also said he was an excludable alien because he did not have the requisite and pre-documents as an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.263" offset="3196426">Now, the District Court said, that as he reads the statute, it requires a conviction not at the time that one is an -- an alien but he found as this Court has found in Costello, that since the conviction took place in 1952 and he was a citizen at that time, that could not be a basis for his exclusion or his deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.955" offset="3291199">He also found with respect to the entry documents that not until there had been a judicial determination of his expatriation, could it be concluded that he was in fact an alien.</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.782" offset="4194513">I'm merely referring to the language in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.228" offset="4208306">It is true that under Section 244 of the Act of 1952, after a period of seven years and a showing of good moral character, assuming that Marks hasn't been deported by that time to whatever country will accept him; he can make an application for change of status as a lawful permanent resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.948" offset="4307153">But that requires not only the consent of the Attorney General, but is subject to review by the House of Representatives and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.040" offset="4343515">And I think it is not a rush guessed say that is most unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.016" offset="4363473">In view of the background of the petitioner, that it is most unlikely that permission will ever be granted to this man to become a lawful resident of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.976" offset="4407254">Now, I think that any discussion of Section 349 (a) (3) has to be preceded by a discussion of the background of how this country has treated foreign military service relative to the question of expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.454" offset="4477158">That type of treatment is not consistently made on either of the briefs before Your Honors and so I shall dwell upon that at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.205" offset="4516237">Until 1868, this Court, this country did not generally recognized the right of expatriation even where the individual will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.750" offset="4570363">Incompatible with that attitude, the early cases on the subject consistently rejected the notion that military service abroad constituted the basis for expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.340" offset="4636714">Congress had the question before it twice, first, in 1797 and then again in 1880, both in connection with legislation dealing with privateers and enlisting to serve in foreign military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.347" offset="4704737">In both instances, the Congress rejected the concept that foreign military service would constitute a basis for expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.759" offset="4742457">But I think in all fairness, it should be said that that was part of the general attitude that there could be no expatriation even if the individual will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.532" offset="4785507">The first time that the concept of the voluntary right of renunciation of citizenship became a governing principle in our laws, is under the laws, the Act of 1868, following the great opinion of Attorney General Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.544" offset="4869517">And the concept was there enunciated in general language that every individual had the right to expatriate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.436" offset="4897102">It did not undertake to enumerate what kinds of acts would constitute expatriation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.198" offset="4932211">That was left to the interpretation on an ad hoc basis if you please, by the Secretary of State as the problems arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.922" offset="4967111">And I think it will be acknowledged that the consistent interpretation of the Act of 1868 was that military service abroad, where there was no oath of allegiance taken to the foreign country and whose service the individual was engaged, was no basis for expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.212" offset="5060211">Yes, the State Department did withhold diplomatic protection of the individual unless if there was a condition of what they characterize as inhuman treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.544" offset="5113501">But other than that, the consistent attitude taken by the executive branch of this Government from 1868 and as we'll be seeing down to 1952 was that if an individual engaged in military service abroad but took no oath of allegiance to the foreign power involved, he did not by such military service alone, renounced his American citizenship or -- or his allegiance because it was understood that it was quite plausible to undertake to fight battles of foreign countries and still retained an allegiance to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.804" offset="5282565">It was properly remembered that Kosciusko, that La Follette -- Lafayette during the revolutionary war, fought in behalf of the American forces, revolutionary forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.827" offset="5338676">That they were a contingent of 6000 French troops who supported him and it was understood that they never lost their French citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.295" offset="5376502">It was probably remembered that during the Civil War, thousands of Germans came to this country and assisted the northern forces in the Civil War and not only never lost their German citizenship but were paid pensions by the United States when they returned to Germany to enjoy their German citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.563" offset="5461661">Now in 1907, there was the first attempt in statutory form to codify the instances of expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.349" offset="5516727">Instead of the general language of the Act of 1868, there were a few précised instances which were now enumerated which would constitute renunciation of American citizenship, expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.545" offset="5577540">And when it came to the question of service abroad, the Act codified and made explicit, the line of interpretation by the State Department that only foreign service, where there had been an oath of allegiance taken to the foreign power involved, would be the basis for expatriation and that was a situation down to the enactment of the Nationality Act of 1952 because the adoption of the Nationality Act of 1940 did not truly change the line of construction which I've indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.648" offset="6037922">In 1940, after five years of study by a cabinet committee appointed by then President Roosevelt, it was proposed that a certain series of acts shall be deemed as an indication of a transfer of allegiance from this country to another country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.554" offset="6117543">And among the acts so-referred to, was foreign military service, this time without reference to an oath or taking on the allegiance or the citizenship of the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.630" offset="6161847">It is rather interesting that in the proposal for such legislation, Mr. (Inaudible) who is the Assistant Legal Adviser of the State Department testifying in support of the proposed bill said that, it does not seem reasonable that a person should give himself up and risk his life for the good of a foreign state and remain a citizen of the United States although it maybe reasonable to provide for recovering citizenship readily in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.423" offset="6285040">In other words, it was still made clear that the option to be an American citizen or to lose the American citizenship was to be left with the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.736" offset="6330284">And as a matter of fact, that's how the Nationality Act of 1940 comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.664" offset="6350033">Because while the House Bill provides the denationalization, irrespective of any alternative citizenship or taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign country, the Senate revised the bill and it was the Senate revision which was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.151" offset="6419937">That Senate revision provided that there would be loss of American citizenship for foreign military service, if the individual either had or required the citizenship of that other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.589" offset="6477720">Now that took care of two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.714" offset="6494229">It took care of the situation of one acquiring the foreign nationality or taking an oath of allegiance to the foreign country in conjunction with entering the military service, one that took care of another problem which was concerning the Congress at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.108" offset="6555773">It was the problem of dual nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.433" offset="6569148">It was the problem of the individual who came to this country, became a naturalized American citizen and went abroad and when conscripted into the service of his native land, invoked American intervention on the grounds that he was an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.281" offset="6644485">Now to a great extent, that problem had been solved by a series of treating known as the Bancroft Treaties starting in the latter part of the 19th Century, but it was still a residual problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.121" offset="6687848">I may say that there was practically no discussion in the congressional debates at the time of the adoption of the Act of 1940, very little discussion in the reports and just a bear smattering of discussion relative to this problem at the hearings, none of which bears upon the problems we have actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.762" offset="6786382">In the adoption of the Nationality Act of 1940, it was also provided that those persons who had been in a foreign military service of an ally during World War I and subsequently this was extended to service in the armed forces of an ally in World War II, could very quickly recover their American citizenship simply by taking an oath of affirmation and repudiating any other citizenship they may have acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.055" offset="6895574">All other forms of military service could be the basis for re-naturalization under Section 317 (c) of the Act of 1940, by the ordinary naturalization procedures except you didn't have to wait five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.497" offset="6957328">And so, it was clear under the Nationality Act of 1940 that a man could regain his American citizenship rather expeditiously if that was his intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.132" offset="6999855">And so in that effect, of the Nationality Act of 1940 was not substantially to alter the basic concept that renunciation of American citizenship in connection with foreign military service was a voluntary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.458" offset="7061191">The change takes place in 1952 and what I can only characterize is a piece of freak legislation in view of the substantial interest which were involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2163.931" offset="8759045">Now in 1950, the Senate Judiciary Committee then under the Chairmanship of Senator McCarran, issued a report in which he suggested that it was most unfortunate and improper that the denationalizing effect of foreign military service should be made dependent upon whether one had taken an oath of allegiance to a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.193" offset="8860191">From his point of view, loss of American citizenship should be predicated upon what our laws prescribed and not upon to protrude a circumstance of what a foreign country may require as a condition for a military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.349" offset="8920795">And he, therefore, recommended that there should be denationalization in all instances of foreign military service, another word -- another word in the report that this would result in statelessness, no debates on the subject, no hearings on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.878" offset="8994879">But in 1952, the adoption of the recommendation of the Senate Committee Report without one word, anywhere to be found that this would result in a condition of statelessness in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.697" offset="9042108">As a matter of fact as Your Honors will see shortly in all cases of any significance under 349 (a) (3) because after the decision of this Court in Nishikawa, which held that where a dual national is conscripted into the military service of his -- of his native land, he doesn't lose his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.785" offset="9126536">What that means then is that only in the case of a Native American, who voluntarily enters into a foreign military service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.198" offset="11828120">If that is so, then the legislative history here indicates that the Congress was undertaken to delineate an irrebutable presumption which is contrary to experience and for that reason as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.002" offset="11883395">Now, if the Congress was saying, however, not that all instances of foreign military service are demonstrative of a renunciation of American allegiance, but that many are and therefore, they can be nationalized for all instances of foreign military service, then this case does come within Mendoza, Mr. Justice Goldberg, and squarely, because it is quite difficult of criminal penal legislation to say, "We're not going to undertake to determine whether every kind of proscribed act is or is not socially harmful."</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.818" offset="12034696">We will punish all action of a defined character so as to deter all such action whether potentially or actually, socially undesirable, we punish it be -- for purposes of deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.428" offset="12097076">If the purpose here, therefore, was to expatriate because many instances of foreign military service were demonstrative of a foreign allegiance and this was one way of deterring such activity, then this comes within Mendoza.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.913" offset="12163009">And as a matter of fact, this is precisely the way the United Nations has construed legislation of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.382" offset="12204910">In 1949, the Secretary of the UN published a study called "A Study of Statelessness."</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.510" offset="12241377">Since I don't refer to what my brief, I should like to read it very briefly to Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.452" offset="12261230">At pages 140 -- page 140 of that study, after making a study of this subject throughout the world, they have a caption, "The deprivation of nationality as a penalty."</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.797" offset="12322565">Cases of individual forfeiture of nationality as a penalty are frequent and vary from country-to-country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.180" offset="12352136">In such cases, the State accuses one of its nationals of committing an act or adopting an attitude contrary to its interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.939" offset="12383169">The main grounds for the deprivation of nationality as a penalty are ascertained to be following, (a) Entry into the service of a foreign government more particularly enrolment in the armed forces of a foreign country, a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.870" offset="12458820">Now, it is argued, however, that this case comes within Perez because this is not a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.126" offset="12495914">Statelessness, perpetual risk of deportation, indefinite detention, this is not a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.534" offset="12537501">Now, I suggest to the Court that quite apart from the purpose served by 349 (a) (3), the mere imposition of such a condition is a penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.336" offset="12660694">In Wong Wing, you had a statute which provided that persons unlawfully in this country could be arrested, detained and subjected to hard labor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.068" offset="12935607">If I correctly understand the ruling in Perez, it is that the foundation for this type of expatriating legislation can be found in the foreign affairs powers of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.501" offset="12997360">And basically, what I understand from Perez is that where individual conduct has the effect of potentially involving the United States in some embroilment or embarrassment with foreign countries, that in those circumstances, there is the power to denationalize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.089" offset="13067682">According to Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the problem is terminated by terminating the citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.831" offset="13094745">Now, whatever such justification could have been found in the factual situation in Perez, it is not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.438" offset="13125151">I see only two possible bases for the exercise of the foreign affairs powers in this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.871" offset="13150856">The first is in those instances where an American serves in a foreign army and then invokes American intervention to get him out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.531" offset="13189517">Now of course, that's not the problem in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.923" offset="13203101">Because in Nishikawa, he was conscripted, in the first place he's denationalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.460" offset="13225253">Consequently, this particular function can exist only where the man has voluntarily entered the foreign military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.075" offset="13255659">And in those circumstances, the potential that he may after voluntarily entering the foreign military service invoke American assistance to get him out, I think is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.400" offset="13304978">The second and the more substantial problem derives from the proposition that if American engages in military service on behalf of a foreign government, his individual action may be associated with the foreign policy of this nation that we will in some matter of fashion, be identified with the aspirations, with the motivations of the particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.850" offset="13406751">Now, this I think to be, wholly at odds with the legislative history here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.020" offset="13435486">I challenge my friend to point to a one word in any of the debates, any of the reports, anything in the history of disarray of the comparable legislation, to indicate that the Congress had any concern for that problem, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.695" offset="13506121">There is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.994" offset="13511346">And that's not an oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.299" offset="13520541">The reason for that is that Congress found that the problem had been solved by other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.438" offset="13545096">And what do I mean by that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.752" offset="13554395">Historically, we have taken the position that when a man serves in the foreign military force, we disclaim any diplomatic responsibility for him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3382.603" offset="13633808">But more simply than that Your Honor, what we have done in the past and the reason why I submit that Congress has not acted further on this subject is that when an American is on a foreign military service, the problem is solved simply by saying, "We'll assume no diplomatic responsibility for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.579" offset="13713638">We disclaim any identification with the policy" and that's how we've solved the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.496" offset="13733386">That's why Congress never referred itself to that problem in the enactment of Section 349 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.924" offset="13759091">And as a matter of fact, because of the availability of this technique which is proven so successful historically, I think, the only fair thing to say is that when the Congress undertakes the use of cannon to demolish a mosquito, you have to suspect that they're really after the wall on which the mosquito has lodged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.439" offset="13841115">What has really happened here is that the disparity between the alleged problem, to which Congress never addressed itself, as distinct would may have been the case in Perez, that this so-called foreign affairs problem just never existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.634" offset="13905899">And if it did, and if that Congress undertook to treat it by these means, liquidating a man's nationality if not his personality, then we would have to say that to use such gross means, to mean such a municipal problem, is characteristic of penal legislation once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.782" offset="13986461">Now, I had hoped Your Honor to treat the question of deportability of Marks even assuming him to be an alien.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.827" offset="14130657">But I will say at all candid, that I am before this Court because I devoutly believe that the Chief Justice's position in the Perez case is the only correct one compatible with this society at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.732" offset="14202337">I understand that position ultimately to mean that to its expatriates someone for non-renunciatory action, action which doesn't renounce American allegiance, jeopardizes the basis of a democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.365" offset="14264822">Now, that's a large statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.188" offset="14272136">We don't make such statements generally these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.313" offset="14288645">But I'm firmly convinced of it because I believe that in a democracy, a part from a naturalization powers, it is the citizenry who chooses the Government and not the Government who chooses the citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.155" offset="14363982">As a matter of fact, we stand unique among the great democracies of the world in this type of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.075" offset="14391672">I've studied the Nationality Acts of all the countries cited at page 60 of my opponent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.203" offset="14424168">And I say to this Court that with the exception of such countries -- not such, with exception of Afghanistan, Austria, Cuba, Indonesia, Panama and Turkey, with the exception of those countries, there is not another country in the world which denationalizes under the circumstances which are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.607" offset="14529808">In many, when there is foreign military service, the Government notifies the individual that if he persists in the foreign military service, he would be deprived of his citizenship and he has given a choice whether he's to keep his citizenship or continue in that service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3778.716" offset="15218186">Upon the conclusion of the questioning, the immigration officers placed him under arrest and commenced deportation proceedings against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.974" offset="15255280">Extensive hearings were conducted on nine separate days over a period of a couple of months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.690" offset="15286105">Petitioner was represented by counsel.After the hearings were completed, a deportation order was entered against him by the special inquiry officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.180" offset="15324139">The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.During the pendency of the deportation proceedings, petitioner brought habeas corpus proceedings challenging his detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.347" offset="15376802">That habeas corpus writ was heard before District Judge Levet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.551" offset="15401566">Judge Levet ruled that the challenge to the merits was premature and that the insofar as the detention by the immigration officers was concerned, the record demonstrated that the detention was based on adequate ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.724" offset="15470320">Therefore, he dismissed writ of habeas -- habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3877.565" offset="15613680">The trial court considered the evidence de novo and after his consideration, Judge Cashin ruled that the petitioner lost his citizenship whose service in the military forces of Cuba but the statute was constitutional and as the discussion is developed, the judge ruled further that petitioner was not deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.682" offset="15702079">Because at the time he entered the United States in July 1960, according to the court he had not yet lost his citizenship because he could lose only if a court determine that he had lost citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="4457.328" offset="17932727">Travel between the Unites States and Cuba was relatively free at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.933" offset="17951117">Other people are going on vacation trips, yet petitioner stayed for 17 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.229" offset="17972328">And when he deserted, he said the reason for my desertion is because people were after me not because my service was involuntary because I had fallen into this favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.498" offset="18013393">Or I submit that this claim of involuntariness is in the language of the District Court absurd, frivolous and unbelievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.987" offset="18055293">Now, I -- I want to get to one point before I -- I deal with the constitutional issues and that's been suggested in the argument of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.118" offset="18095835">The claim is made that this statute in order to avoid constitutional difficulties should be construed as -- so as to require a positive -- a positive intent to give up citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.043" offset="18147558">Now of course, such a claim cannot be based on the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.019" offset="18167411">As I read the statute, I believe this is a reasonable and inescapable reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.380" offset="18188936">The statute definitely contemplates that overt actions prescribed in the statute shall cause loss of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.525" offset="18221432">Thus the introductory language of Section 349 (a) (3), the general statute dealing with expatriation says, "A person who performs one of the following specified actions shall lose his nationality."</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.408" offset="18277021">Now, Section 349 (a) (3) in the construction which the petitioner suggests would depend on the unlikely contingency that the person involved would say, "I did intend to give up citizenship."</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.217" offset="18344208">There isn't anything in that statute to justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.745" offset="18358314">And if that construction is accepted, it would in effect nullify the other statutory provisions dealing with the subject, dealing with voting, with naturalization in the foreign state, with taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign state, with residence in a foreign state, with taking a -- an office or employment in the employee of a foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.960" offset="18459251">When Congress wished to prescribe a -- an affirmative intent, Congress had no difficulty in doing this as in the provisions for renunciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.796" offset="18498539">Congress said that if a person wants to renounce citizenship voluntarily, that's a way for him to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.317" offset="18524662">It failed to do that in 349 (a) (3) and it seems to me, it was up to be -- obviously not intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.718" offset="18550262">Moreover, of course if, the construction that petitioner suggest is adopted, there wouldn't be any need for 349 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.348" offset="18576802">A person who wished to renounce citizenship could do so under 349 (a) (6), under the specific provisions for renunciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.653" offset="18610030">Now, petitioner cites no cases to support this possible construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.345" offset="18628733">And of course, it is directly opposed to the decisions of this Court in Mackenzie against Hare, in Savorgnan against the United States, in Perez against Brownell.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.911" offset="18678993">Each of those cases and each of them, the citizen said, "I had no desire to cast off citizenship."</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.283" offset="18708459">Yet in each case, this Court held that citizenship, the loss of citizenship depends not on the individual's objective intended, but rather on the voluntary performance of certain actions which Congress designates as ground for expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.338" offset="18776691">Now, I believe it's not possible to construe this statute in the way which petitioner suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.025" offset="18799470">And therefore, we come to the question of whether Congress had power to prescribe such consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.741" offset="18830294">Now, I think the main thrust of petitioner's argument is his contention that this statute is penal in its form and purpose and its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.771" offset="18882435">From this claim, he next proceed to another step.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.112" offset="18895809">He says, "Since I find that this statute is punitive then, it is subject to the Eighth Amendment's bar against cruel and unusual punishments and also subject to the procedural restrictions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments."</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.144" offset="18963937">None of the legislative materials cited in petitioner's brief and none of the materials that we've been able to find has even the slightest suggestion of any punitive aim on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.069" offset="19015659">Indeed, the legislative materials and we cite them in our brief at pages 44 and 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.958" offset="19039169">The legislative materials show that Congress was concerned with a condition which -- which prejudiced our foreign relations and that Congress wished to regulate these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.057" offset="19095594">The aim of the legislation insofar as the legislative report is concerned, reveals no suggestion of -- of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.296" offset="19132583">It merely shows that Congress intended to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.281" offset="19152541">Just one -- one word from the Committee Report on the 1940 Act, in those reports, the Cabinet Committee which drafted that statute, had this to say about the foreign military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.016" offset="19175424">They said that an American who served in the military forces of a foreign army and thereby offered his all in support of that stage, should be deemed to have transferred his allegiance to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.454" offset="19261210">Mr. Richard Foronjy whose testimony, my colleague has quoted, expressed substantially the same foot in his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.174" offset="19296110">Now, there's nothing to suggest the punitive aim in any of these materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.166" offset="19320038">There's nothing to suggest a punitive aim in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.357" offset="19340831">And I suggest that in the absence of this indicia of punishment, it isn't possible to ascribe to Congress a motive to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.233" offset="19384299">As this Court said in the Nestor case, Fleming against Nestor, punishment can be found only upon the clearest showing that punishment was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.711" offset="19438216">Now, petitioner goes on and relies on the decision of this Court in Mendoza-Martinez and the plurality opinion in Trop against Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.710" offset="19486177">I suggest that petitioner misconceives those decisions and opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.212" offset="19516270">Mendoza-Martinez involved, as Mr. Justice Goldberg pointed out earlier, involved evasion of selective service obligations under a statute which, upon examination of an extensive leg -- legislative history was found to intend punishment for the crime of draft avoidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.804" offset="19602578">Now, Trop similarly found on the basis of the statute itself and also an extensive examination of the legislative history, that's the statute -- I believe the language of the Chief Justice was that the evident purpose of the statute was to impose an additional punishment for the crime of desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.815" offset="19694634">And the Chief Justice went on to say, "There is no other possible purpose that this statute can be taken to serve."</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.978" offset="19727235">Now, this statute has no punitive overtones.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.810" offset="19738624">There was no showing that punishment was intended and therefore, these decisions have no relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.116" offset="19763806">Petitioner's major thesis is that because the statute results in statelessness, then it must necessarily be punitive and therefore, it must subject him to cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.886" offset="19830888">Now, I think in making this argument, the petitioner again misunderstands the plurality opinion in Trop against Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.929" offset="19863071">The Chief Justice there found, first, on the basis of this extensive review of the legislative history that the statute imposed punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.912" offset="19899016">Then the Chief Justice went on to say that, "Such punishment resulting in statelessness was cruel and unusual."</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.093" offset="19927751">Here, there's no punishment of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.563" offset="19937573">Therefore, the question of whether the punishment is cruel and unusual cannot come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.091" offset="19963695">But the argument that statelessness necessarily entails punishment, in my view, cannot be supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.443" offset="19989191">Unless, for example, a person can become stateless in many ways, through his own voluntary choice, he can renounce his citizenship and become stateless.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.989" offset="20055333">Does that punish him?</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.385" offset="20055228">He can take an oath of allegiance to a foreign government and become stateless.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.403" offset="20064946">I believe that -- that the fact that the person is stateless is not an evidence of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.443" offset="20093158">This is a consequence which an individual has suffered as a result of his voluntary action.</text>

            <text syncTime="5204.458" offset="20921240">Now, one further word on the question of the severity of the consequence was he -- argues the argument has made and because this is of a severe consequence, it must be punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.408" offset="20968991">Now, under our laws, people are citizens and aliens, unsubjected to many severe consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.698" offset="20998144">These include of course, deportation, denaturalization, the uses -- limitation on the use and enjoinment of property, liability to selective service obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.935" offset="21051120">None of these is deemed punishment at least under the decisions of this Court, in the constitutional sense unless there is a specific legislative design to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.241" offset="21104306">Now, I'd submit that the -- the statute, Section 349 (a) (3), cannot be demolished on petitioner's unsupported assertion that the statute was punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.063" offset="21163656">And I want to borrow again from the language of the Chief Justice, Chief Justice said in his plurality opinion in Trop, "A statute cannot be interpreted by pasting a label on it," I think that's a very felicitous phrase and I think it applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.142" offset="21231992">This statute cannot be denounced by merely taking a label and putting on a statute and say, "This is punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.223" offset="21260309">There has to be some glue to make it stick."</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.914" offset="21271071">And the glue consists of a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.417" offset="21280998">The clearest showing in the language of Nestor that punishment was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.455" offset="21301164">Only in that way can this statute be characterized as punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.689" offset="21326137">Now, I want to get to the question, in my mind the only question on constitutionality and that is whether this statute fulfills a legislative purpose where that reasonably effectuates a power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.298" offset="21400534">To me, this is the only issue in the case on the question of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.245" offset="21420387">Now here, the controlling principles are enunciated in this Court's decision in Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.505" offset="21453406">Perez found it proper for Congress to prescribe expatriation for the involvement by an American citizen in the political affairs of a foreign state, their voting and underlying that decision, were two basic premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.616" offset="21525817">The first of these is that it was proper for Congress to deal with such conduct, which potentially or actually could involve this Government in embroilments and embarrassments in its relations with foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.929" offset="21607111">And the second consideration was that it was not unreasonable for Congress to deem that the citizens' participation in the political affairs of a foreign nation was to some extent, an indication of his attachment to the foreign nation and to some extent, inconsistent with allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.856" offset="21706794">Now, I submit that both of these considerations are present here and that their impact is even more potent than in Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.956" offset="21751202">Military service is a more positive act of commitment to a foreign state, more positive involvement in the affairs of a foreign state than voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.983" offset="21799267">It may conflict with national policies of neutrality as it has in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.163" offset="21824031">It may lead this nation down the road of danger and embarrassment which can't be perilous to this country and to its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.815" offset="21862588">And the second consideration mentioned in Perez, the possibility of impaired allegiance is, I believe, equally present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.089" offset="21907728">For military service, the person who serves in the army of a foreign state has committed himself to that State, has subjected himself to the mandates and the orders of that State to a degree which indicates some commitment to that State and some degree of lessened allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.806" offset="22006575">In any event, using the criterion of Perez, it seems to me that it was reasonable for Congress to conclude that these events could occur and did occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.117" offset="22055790">Now, the statute Section 349 (a) (3) thus, on its face, seems to represent a reasonable effort to deal with the twin problems of embroilments, passive embroilments and impaired allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.981" offset="22143248">Now, we are at left the conjecture about this because the legislative history demonstrates a very sharp awareness on the part of Congress to these problems and a desire to deal with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.034" offset="22203538">We deal with the legislative history extensively at pages 54 to 58 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.108" offset="22227780">Now, I want to summarize it very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.536" offset="22241468">Military service by American citizens and the armed forces of foreign nation -- foreign nations, has been a matter of deep concern to this nation from its very inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.517" offset="22285458">As a matter of fact, one of the earliest Supreme Court cases talked of the possibility of such embarrassment to our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.450" offset="22317223">In the three basic statutes in this field, dealing with expatriations, those of 1907, 1940 and 1952, Congress showed its awareness with these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.678" offset="22374066">Now in the 1907 statute, the Committee, the Administrative Committee and the State Department which granted that statute, spoke of the actions of citizens in foreign states which were causing increasing embarrassment to our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.223" offset="22444283">In the 1940 Nationality Act, the Cabinet Committee which drafted that statute spoke of the desire on the part of that Committee to deal with such problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.240" offset="22500289">And then specifically, in relation to military service, the Committee pointed out that in their view, a person as I quoted before, a person who gives his all, offers his all to a country thereby should be deemed to have shown some allegiance to their country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.487" offset="22581269">And then in 1952, Congress, when they re-codified the statutes through the Judiciary -- Senate Judiciary Committee which was responsible for the 1952 Act, Congress said that, "We're revising this law so that the determination of whether a person loses nationality shall not depend upon the determination of a foreign government and shall be uniformed."</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.123" offset="22691819">Moreover, the Committee and Congress in turn which adopted the Committee's recommendations, recognize the close identity between military service and the conduct of foreign affairs by the provision which is now found in Section 349 (a) (3) that such service would expatiate unless it was approved in writing by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.150" offset="22811982">The officers charged primarily with activities in the field, a foreign relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.811" offset="22842598">The legislative design to tie this power to expatriate to the conduct of foreign affairs thus emerges quietly clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.659" offset="22894007">The only remaining question is whether the means chosen to effectuate that policy are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.963" offset="22923264">This is the rational nexus concept of Perez or the reasonable relationship, and other -- other language has been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.722" offset="22966209">Whether there's a rational nexus between the -- the means -- the -- the end that Congress sought to achieve and the means that if you --</text>

            <text syncTime="5742.771" offset="23074461">Now, the same issue of course was confronted in Perez against Brownell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.926" offset="23095045">And there, the Court said that it is the citizenship of the individual which causes the difficulty, the fact that the citizen is involved in political activities in foreign countries, the fact that he's a citizen of the United States is what causes the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.493" offset="23169337">And the Court said, "The termination of the citizenship terminates the problem."</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.631" offset="23193893">Now, the same thought is expressed by Mr. Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in Trop against Dulles and I quote, it's at page 59 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.017" offset="23231404">Mr. Justice Brennan said, "Congress might reasonably believe -- believe that in these circumstances, there is no acceptable alternative to expatriation as a means of avoiding possible embarrassments to our relations with foreign countries."</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.110" offset="23303816">Now, these considerations obviously are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.246" offset="23320325">Since the military service by an American in the army of a foreign country, has in it, the potentiality of involving our country in embarrassments, in embroilments and his citizenship is a thing that causes the trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.135" offset="23391901">In the language of Perez, the termination of his citizenship terminates the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.356" offset="23416769">And in the language of Mr. Justice Brennan, it was reasonable for Congress to conclude that there is no acceptable alternative to expatriation as a means of dealing with this problem and borrowing further from Mr. Justice Brennan, the Mendoza-Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.627" offset="23485837">Congress could conclude that this was a proper device for -- to cope with actions which could dangerously prejudice our diplo -- diplomacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.558" offset="23525648">Mr. Justice Brennan quoted a uniquely potent corrector for such actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.673" offset="23550098">Now, without this power, Congress would be powerless to deal with actions of citizens in foreign countries, so long as they remained in foreign countries, the actions which prejudiced our nation, prejudiced its diplomacy, involve our Government in dangers which could affect every citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.340" offset="23636720">Now, petitioner also makes one argument with which I'd like to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.014" offset="23655424">He says that Section 349 (a) (3) is not confined to embarrassing service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.493" offset="23681337">It could reach non-embarrassing service in the army of a friendly nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.907" offset="23707042">Now the answer, as this Court pointed out in Perez, is that in dealing with a problem as complex and as vital as the power to conduct foreign affairs, Congress must be free to legislate in the language of Perez on more than an ad hoc basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.856" offset="23794813">In dealing with such a complex power, Congress should have the authority, the scope to establish reasonable general classifications so that the problem can -- can be dealt with as it arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="6626.543" offset="26609560">The statute recognizes the possibility that there will be cases where the service would not be embarrassing, and it deals with that situation by expressly permitting approval of the service by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="6665.406" offset="26765040">This case originated of course, as a deportation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6669.599" offset="26781759">If the petitioner loses on his claim that he's a citizen, then will have to determine whether the deportation order is valid since this is habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="6679.261" offset="26820420">A deportation is premised on Section 241 (a) (1) of the statute which provides that a -- the Congress can -- that the Attorney General can deport an alien who entered the United States in violation of law -- in violation of law which had existed at the time of his entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6701.095" offset="26907773">The Court of Appeals, the -- the administrative authorities relied on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6706.799" offset="26930552">First, that petitioner in 19 -- 1960 -- July 1960, when he entered at El Paso, Texas, did not possess the requisite document, an immigrant visa, he was an alien, he didn't have an immigrant visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.167" offset="27000038">And second, that prior to that entry, he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.279" offset="27028459">Now, the Court of Appeals sustained the first ground and found it unnecessary to writ the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="6736.247" offset="27048312">We think both grounds are supported, however like the Court of Appeals, I should like to emphasize the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="6744.235" offset="27080286">I think that in itself is a valid ground for the deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6964.983" offset="27963329">Perez against Brownell, depended specifically on a finding that the virtue of the expatriation device, the value of it in implementing the foreign affairs function resulted chiefly from the fact that it operated automatically.</text>

            <text syncTime="7006.264" offset="28128423">Now, the Court found that the statute in that case, since it inflicted punishment required under the procedural guarantees of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment, a -- a criminal -- a trial in the nature of a criminal trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.676" offset="28190072">But there's no punishment here and there -- therefore, there is no such requirement in this case.</text>
