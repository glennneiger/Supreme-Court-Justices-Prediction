            <text syncTime="91.431" offset="469138">Let me get this out of the way at the beginning, the Government conceded that this criminal action might have been brought in the District of Minnesota to its transferor's request.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.463" offset="505187">There's no way issue in this case of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.988" offset="515323">Question, it relates to the action of the District Court in refusing to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.584" offset="533713">Now in this case, a motion to transfer was scrupulous filed in the District Court in the Eastern District of Illinois where the indictment had been returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.417" offset="573001">The District Court after full consideration denied the motion ruling that it would be in the interest of justice for this case to be tried in the district there.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.937" offset="619081">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit concluded that one of ten factors which I'll come to in a moment which the District Court had relied on in denying the motion for transfer, was an improper fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.636" offset="677909">It then undertook to review the rest of the record without this one factor, concluded that without this one factor, this case should be transferred to the District of Minnesota and issued a writ of mandamus directing the petitioner Judge Platt to transfer the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.902" offset="750947">There are two basic issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.262" offset="760456">First, the propriety of the Court of Appeals using the writ of mandamus at all to review this order and secondly, which is the principal issue that we've argued in our brief, assuming that the Court of Appeals was warranted in using the writ in these circumstances, did the Court of Appeals err when upon finding that one of the 10 factors relied upon was an erroneous one undertaking itself, itself to weigh these factors in concluding where the interest of justice lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.211" offset="884172">We contend that in the circumstances, assuming that writ was properly used when it found that there had been an improper factor relied on, it was obligatory on the Court of Appeals to remand this case to the District Court, to enable the district judge to re-exercise his discretion on the basis of the proper factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.412" offset="2277021">Well, I -- I perhaps -- perhaps I am, I -- I think I don't know that this Court has ever specifically approved the use of mandamus to review it, an order of transfer but I can conceive of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.061" offset="2323623">I've give --give Your Honor one, there was a case in the Sixth Circuit some years ago where one district in the Circuit transferred a case to another district.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.869" offset="2358836">The other district said that the first district was wrong and transferred it back again.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.712" offset="2378271">Then the first district said to the second district, "You had no business doing -- instruct the case from the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.480" offset="2397288">Well, it seems to me in that kind of situation involving a transfer order there must be some power in the appellate court to compel action there.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.636" offset="2429889">Then, the indictment in this case was filed as I've indicated in the City of Danville in the Eastern District of Illinois, it charged Minnesota Mining and I shall refer to Minnesota Mining here by its colloquial name of 3M with violating Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.003" offset="2503346">The indictment was in nine counts and there were three counts relating to each of three principal products of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.826" offset="2534693">In each of these three products that was charged that Minnesota Mining had conspired to monopolize, had attempted to monopolize and it conspired to restrain trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.643" offset="2581922">The basic theory of the indictment, the whole, the unifying threat of the case is that what Minnesota Mining had done is had it used its patents with the threat of patent suits with the actual bring of patent suits to coerce its competitors into accepting licenses from Minnesota Mining which contained various restrictive provisions violative of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.938" offset="2691114">The -- each of these nine counts charged that the offence committed has been conduct -- has been carried out in part within the Eastern District of Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.015" offset="3587427">Now, Minnesota Mining in support of its motion to transfer filed nine affidavits of company officials and of its lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.658" offset="3625984">And these -- these various affidavits set forth considerations which should make it more convenient to the company for the case to be tried in Minnesota and would make it less convenient to the company for the case to be tried in Danville.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.503" offset="3685334">They pointed out that the headquarters were in the Eastern District of Minnesota in Saint Paul that will be easier for counsel during the trial of this lengthy case to confer with these officials in this district.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.275" offset="3736430">They pointed out that it will be expense incurred in transferring the case because of the need to transport records, living expenses in Danville, various things and they also mentioned that according to the allegations in the indictment with they've been able to determine with one exception, no competitor resided in the Eastern District, no coconspirators resided in the Eastern District and that no meetings with alleged coconspirators took place there.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.031" offset="3851473">Finally, they stressed that there would be no delay in the trial if it were transferred because they said the docket in Minnesota is current and the average case load for a judge in the District if Minnesota is less, slightly less than the average case load in the Eastern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.408" offset="3932975">The Government filed two affidavits in response, one of which was that of Mr. Jenkinson, the Head of our Midwest Office in the antitrust division, the Government's chief trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.250" offset="3976338">The affidavit first explained why this case was brought in the Eastern District of Illinois, pointed out the case had its inception when a complaint was received that had originated in the Eastern District of Illinois in East Saint Louis relating to one of these three products involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.580" offset="4049690">But after a preliminary investigation, the Government had been authorized to convene a grand jury to investigate this particular product and that -- as the investigation continued and the grand jury investigation lasted two years, complaints came in with respect to two other of these products involved and therefore the grand jury having gone and started the investigations expanded to cover all three products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.932" offset="4147075">They also pointed out with respect to the burdens which 3M stated it would have to undergo if it was forced to try the case in Danville, that this company itself, had undertaken in the past to try a very substantial numbers in 35 patent infringement cases in districts far removed from its home office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.459" offset="4237249">Even though those who are -- many of those with cases in which venue might have been laid in the District if Minnesota that in the trial of these cases, this company brought a large number of witnesses, a large number of records, a large of attorneys to distant forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.269" offset="4292420">And that indeed, Minnesota Mining had participated in one-four weeks trial of one of the patent cases involved in this very suit in the Eastern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.644" offset="4337977">Government also answered the claim of convenience of witnesses pointing out that within a 300 mile radius of Danville there were a substantial number of the Government's witnesses and that all within a 300 mile radius of Saint Paul, only one or two minor Government witnesses lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.249" offset="4416345">And furthermore, that a majority of the Government's key witnesses would find Danville substantially more convenient than Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.196" offset="4452185">The Government also stated that patent license negotiations had taken place in Danville and that a number of residents of the Eastern District -- I might correct that, had taken place in the Eastern District, the patent of negotiation not in Danville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.738" offset="4502340">And that a number of residents of that district would be Government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.205" offset="4516237">Finally, the Government stressed and we think this is important because one of the grounds upon which Judge Platt relied into denying transfer was that trial in Danville would result in trial a year sooner than in the District of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.632" offset="4577886">That attempting to determine the likelihood of a speedy trial, on the basis of testing the average number of cases per judge in each of the district, was not a fair gauge to Judge Platt's docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.032" offset="4631489">And this was because in the District of Minnesota which has one district, there are four judges and the cases are rotated among the four judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.865" offset="4666807">Whereas in the Eastern District of Illinois, there are two judges, one sitting in East Saint Louis, Judge Jergens and Judge Platt sitting in the other division in Danville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.319" offset="4720619">And most of the 327 cases which were pending in the Eastern District were pending before Judge Jergens and would be tried before Judge Jergens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.363" offset="4760848">And the total number of cases pending before Judge Platt was a total of 109 civil or two -- and two criminal cases which this was one, for a total of a 111 cases as against an average of the four judges in the District of Minnesota of 170.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.385" offset="4832946">And they also pointed out information from the clerk of the District Court in Minnesota that the customary practice in that district is a criminal case with a non-natural defendant is put of the end of the calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.021" offset="4887489">And the clerk's office indicated that if this case were transferred to the District of Minnesota, it probably be at least a year until the case could be brought in trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.148" offset="4935973">Extensive briefs were filed on this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.880" offset="4946944">Judge Platt heard two days of oral argument and the court denied transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.677" offset="4970036">The judge draws a lengthy memorandum in which he discussed separately 10 factors which the defendant had urged as a basis to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.751" offset="5010369">He took each one of them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.856" offset="5014758">He found that some of them definitely favored transfer that others militated against transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.065" offset="5039626">He pointed out that while it would be convenience to the plaintiff -- to the defendant if the case were tried in Saint Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.867" offset="5066794">There would also be great convenience to the Government and he took up each one of these factors, found some of them, pro-transfer some of whom against the factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.785" offset="5102529">After discussing the nine factors which are the -- might say the traditional criteria which courts have customarily looked to in passing on transfer motions, he came to a section called, special factors of hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.975" offset="5155297">And one of the factors he said was that in view of the position which Minnesota Mining had achieved in the community, in view of the substantial number of stockholders and employees who reside on that district, it would be more difficult to get a fair and impartial jury in the District of Minnesota than in the Eastern of District of Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.627" offset="5409834">He said that there are number of other factors which also militated against transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.169" offset="5564061">It said that Judge Platt had erred in considering this factor of the Government's difficulty of obtaining an impartial jury in Minneapolis and he said in addition, the case was impressed with the fundamental historical right of defendant to be prosecuted in its own environment or district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.385" offset="5628949">It then itself undertook to review the record and concluded that without this single factor, the interest of justice favored the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.965" offset="5667192">Judge -- Chief Judge Hastings in dissent disagreed with the Court of Appeals on both grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.105" offset="5687777">He thought that there had not been shown an abuse of discretion and certainly not such an abuse of discretion is -- warrant an extraordinary writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.182" offset="5716093">He also said the majority had made an unprecedented procedural error in itself undertaking to balance the interest in deciding where the interest of justice lie rather than sending it back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.328" offset="5772727">Now, I'd like just briefly -- we've developed it in our brief to advert to the question of whether the writ of mandamus was properly employed at all here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.109" offset="5807835">This claim has frequently pointed out the limited office of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.907" offset="5822986">It is not intended as a substitute for appeal that it is limited to correcting a gross abuse of discretion to confining a District Court to the exercise of its proper discretion or to compelling a court to act when action was withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.742" offset="5894353">And we think that even conceding that 1 of the 10 factors should not have been taken into account by the District Judge, the mere lives in 1 of 10 does not rise to the level, the kind of abuse which would warrant review of this interlocutory order through the extraordinary writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.509" offset="5973452">Now to be sure there are some basic distinctions that maybe drawn between the use of the -- the writ in a criminal case to review a transfer order and to review -- and the use in the civil case, the most obvious one is that there is no Interlocutory Appeals Act available in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.686" offset="6038131">On the one hand, this perhaps -- this does show that there's no alternative remedy available by which a litigant may test the transfer order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.717" offset="6070209">But conversely, it seems to us that this also suggest that and -- and underlines the strong policy to which this Court has frequently adverted and fairly recently in the Di Bella case that we should not have piecemeal appeals in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.900" offset="6147009">That criminal cases the -- the importance of a speedy trial overcomes the possibility that a litigant maybe forced to go through a trial and that an error or -- or with a preliminary error which would ultimately infect the proceedings and be cause for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.849" offset="6210748">Now also, I -- I think that I should quite frankly state that it will undoubtedly be more difficult after conviction if there was a conviction to review the discretionary action of a District Court in denying transfer, because basically in these cases transfer is sought on the theory that it's less convenient to be tried in the other forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.399" offset="6300923">And once the trial is over, it will be very difficult to say that the fact that I was inconvenienced is a ground for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.621" offset="6329866">But again, it seems to me, this also cuts two ways that the fact that it's unlikely to be prej -- sufficiently prejudicial to call for reversal, suggests that it's not the kind of thing that should be reviewed on extraordinary writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.072" offset="6395695">The rule in the case Rule 21 (b), we think makes it quite clear despite its terms that this is a matter for the discretion of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.521" offset="6437491">It speaks -- use -- the language it uses say that should be a transfer if the Court is satisfied that in the interest of justice, the case should be transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.407" offset="6469047">The Court is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.517" offset="6473435">It puts it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.460" offset="6477197">The District Court has to be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.329" offset="6484720">The interest of justice is a very broad threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.048" offset="6499558">It doesn't set out particularities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.491" offset="6509380">You don't decide whether a transfer was in the interest of justice by a mathematical process of adding up the factors in favor and the factors against and subtracting one from the other and see where the balance is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.969" offset="6555251">The -- the intangibles involved in making this decision seems to us the kind of thing that necessarily is committed to the discretion of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.039" offset="6591509">And not surprisingly not in view of the statute, this language, the revisers, the Advisory Committee explicitly stated in describing this provision that -- it said that after pointing out the previous -- to Rule 21 (b), there had no been -- been no provision for transfer of venue in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.779" offset="6658487">It stated the matter will now be left in the discretion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.252" offset="6680430">Now, the defendants stressed and they've urged repeatedly that basically, the reason Judge Platt was wrong here apart from this single fact and the reason why that this Court of Appeals correctly directed transfer was, they say they have a -- some historical right to have a right to be tried at their own residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.305" offset="6772590">And that this Court has recognized in construing venue statutes that there is a policy favoring trial at the residence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.338" offset="6804773">But we think when you're dealing with the transfer statute where admittedly the case might have been brought in any one of the number of venues, that the significance of trial at the residence of the defendant is no more than a shorthand phrase for the various advantages, which will flow if a defendant is tried where its more convenient to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.965" offset="6895261">In a case of a corporation, admittedly in some cases there'd be very substantial advantages to being tried at the home or in other cases, there might not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.147" offset="6927966">If the conduct that was challenged in the criminal case involve primarily the officials at a branch office and the records were there I presume the most convenient form would be where that branch office is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.160" offset="6980002">But, we think the important thing in this is that the District Court did consider under the rubric of the interest of justice, all of the factors which the district, which the defendants relied on as justifying and calling for transfer to their home forum and found that these advantages were outweighed and were not -- that the defendants had not shown, had not made the showing that the transfer would be in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.736" offset="7082297">We think it clear that mandamus cannot be used to tell the District Court how to exercise its discretions but only to require the District Court to conduct itself and exercise the discretion in accordance with the proper standards.</text>
