            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="31.470" offset="229230">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.369" offset="244799">This is a direct appeal by the Government from a district court judgment dismissing an information filed under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 as amended in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.248" offset="312404">The information charged the appellee Wiesenfeld Company, with violations of Section 301 (k) of the Act, which among other things makes it a misdemeanor to do any act with respect to food which has been shipped in interstate commerce and which is held for sale which results in the food becoming adulterated.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.494" offset="425357">Specifically it was charged that the Wiesenfeld Company a public warehousing firm in Jacksonville, Florida stored certain foods which had been shipped from Louisiana or Arkansas and Illinois in a building which was accessible to rodents, birds, and insects and otherwise caused the foods to be exposed to contamination by rodents, birds, and insects.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.960" offset="543222">But this amounted to a holding of the food under insanitary conditions and that the fed -- that the food in fact became contaminated by the leavings of the rodents, birds, and insects.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.600" offset="609782">The food involved was rice, breading mix, and hamburger mix packaged in bags, presumably paper or cotton bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.194" offset="648129">The information doesn't specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.553" offset="657533">There were six counts in the information, each charging the same offense with respect to a particular lot of one of the commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.540" offset="697553">Each count charged the contamination of several bags of the food stubs involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.341" offset="728691">The first four counts charged acts done in specified periods before August 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.196" offset="764113">For last two counts, charged similar acts done with respect to the period July 24, 1961 through the beginning of December in the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.352" offset="820746">The District Court dismissed the information on the ground that the statute, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, did not reach the mere holding of goods under insanitary conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.284" offset="888560">The court conceded that the legislative history of the 1958 amendments would seem to support the government's position but the court thought that the text of the provision was insufficiently clear and that to construe it broadly, as the Government urged, would make it unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.002" offset="1007365">It would seem, therefore, that the issue in this case was whether Section 301 (k) of the Act intends to reach a mere holding, as the District Court termed it, of food under insanitary conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.850" offset="1070791">Whether that was the intent of Congress, and if so, whether Congress spoke its mind sufficiently clearly in the statute to avoid the constitutional objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.678" offset="1114049">That was the issue which the Government raised in its appeal and that is the issue to which we address in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.946" offset="1151143">But, if I rightly understand the appellee's brief in this Court, that basic question is no longer in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.714" offset="1190222">They seem to concede that the Act -- the particular provision of the Act does indeed proscribe holding of food under insanitary conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.038" offset="1239542">They couldn't very well dispute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.463" offset="1253230">The Act expressly proscribes any act which results in adulteration.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.251" offset="1280397">The legislative history of 1958 Act makes it perfectly clear that storing in a warehouse is such an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.518" offset="1317491">The text of the provision itself when read in conjunction with other provisions of the Act makes it perfectly clear that a holding is one of the acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.740" offset="1358346">This Court's decision in the Sullivan case makes it clear that there's no limiting interpretation suggested by the initial words of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.083" offset="1419682">As to that point, since it seems to be conceded, we leave it to our brief which is very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.775" offset="1450506">But, after conceding this basic proposition, the appellee, it seems to us at least, tries to raise three subsidiary issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.473" offset="1489272">The first of which is whether the holder, the warehouseman in this case, must have knowledge of the insanitary condition of the place where he stores the food.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.645" offset="1537964">The second question is whether a building which is, in the words of the information, accessible to rodents, birds, and insects is an insanitary place.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.446" offset="1589164">And, finally -- thirdly, whether the statute reaches a public warehousemen who does not own the food he stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.027" offset="1639528">I'll consider each of these questions in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.253" offset="1656351">As to the first one, the question of guilty knowledge, here, we have to make a small concession of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.502" offset="1693341">The appellee notices in our brief a reference to holding under known insanitary conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.694" offset="1742137">That was an inadvertence.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.594" offset="1925726">As a practical matter, we suppose that the warehouseman knows whether or not his building is insanitary.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.146" offset="2803963">To some extent, as this Court has recognized, that the pure food laws as a whole do have something of that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.240" offset="2848371">In Smith versus California or, quite recently, in 361 U.S., in distinguishing the standard -- the constitutionally permissible standard in First Amendment cases and in this sort of case, the Court noticed that, I quote from page 152 of that opinion, “the public interest in the purity of its food is so great as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.316" offset="2956622">In fact, an absolute standard which will not bear the distributor's plea as to the amount of care he has used.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.704" offset="3022137">The same rationale, it seems to me, lies with the Dotterweich opinion and the Sullivan opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.496" offset="3053380">But, here, we do not construe the statute as imposing an absolutely strict liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.156" offset="3080025">One might read the statute as warning a warehouseman that whenever he took in food that was likely to be attacked by rodents or other pests, he did so all together at his risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.360" offset="3148779">And, if in fact the warehouse could not be made rodent-free or pest-free, his only alternative was to refuse to store the food, perhaps ultimately forcing the manufacturer to package the product in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.212" offset="3220250">After all, the purpose of the statute is to protect the consumer who is to be guaranteed food which has not been contaminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.637" offset="3261942">But, we read the statute and the information in this case simply to require that all possible, reasonable measures be taken to make the building as inaccessible to pests as is possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.958" offset="12367182">Well, in listening to the Government's argument and I believe, if I'm not mistaken, their feeling and mine are pretty much the same on this oral argument, but I think that what the information should charge is an act of omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.587" offset="12429772">It should charge that the defendant failed to keep his warehouse as clean as possible under all standards or failed to do this or failed to do that to make his warehouse clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.455" offset="12485151">But, to simply say that the building is accessible to pests, it just -- it's just inconceivable that the mere accessibility with no action on the our part, no failure of duty and, under his reasoning, even if we have taken every single precaution, as we have, and had regular extermination, as we do, in spite of all these precautions, there's nothing we can do to prevent the criminal penalties under the statute if the instruction that this information is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.297" offset="12660590">I think the -- the charge or the act that must be charged is an act of omission, a failure to meet the duty of due care or proper care, if we could use the term, in other words, basically saying what we haven't done -- telling us what we haven't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.184" offset="12780126">That's the gist of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.757" offset="12802382">On the -- one other point that has been raised and that was the question of whether or not the statute would apply to a person who was simply holding the food as opposed -- as a possessor of food rather than as an owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.622" offset="12881899">This is really going to the common understanding of the terms and interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.208" offset="12908231">If you read the statute, it says that the food must be held for sale and this Court itself has recognized and granted in tax cases, but the term “hold” is commonly understood to mean “to own or to have some proprietor interest in it, some control over it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.724" offset="12978239">Now, I concede with the Government that the owner of this food would be guilty of a crime for placing it in an insanitary place, but the person who simply holds it, who takes it in, who doesn't know whether it's for sale or whether it's not for sale, he doesn't have any control over or knowledge of what use that's going to be made of the material and why he should be made guilty of a criminal act simply by another person changing his mind, changing an intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.132" offset="13107911">And well, we'll certainly concede in a -- concede readily that the technicalities of property law should not govern the protection of the public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.088" offset="13151692">The seizure of these foods would certainly protect the public health as much as anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.631" offset="13181889">Actually, In this case here the food was promptly seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.412" offset="13197040">It wasn't even seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.390" offset="13200906">It was promptly destroyed voluntarily that they -- this is common practice in warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.609" offset="13221804">Anytime the food is found to be contaminated, it's seized.</text>
