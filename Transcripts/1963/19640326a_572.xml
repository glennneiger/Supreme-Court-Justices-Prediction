            <label>Mr. J. Harvey Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="14.842" offset="162774">Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.597" offset="181791">I represent the defendant Arnold, having been appointed in the Trial Court below, Arnold who is a member of the Negro race.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.587" offset="221706">The case he is here on certiorari because the North Carolina Supreme Court which affirmed a conviction of these two defendants for murder perpetrated in a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.123" offset="267891">In due course, in the Trial Court, each defendant made timely motions to quash the indictment on the basis that member of their race had been systemically excluded from jury duty in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.006" offset="327346">These motions were overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.882" offset="338944">In the Supreme Court of North Carolina the Trail Court was sustained in that and it was held that we had failed to carry the burden of showing systematic exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.412" offset="401011">In the Trial Court, we called two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.827" offset="410728">We called the county tax supervisor, Mr. Williams and he testified as to his records, tax abstracts and listings of full tax which were kept separately and as he said it would required to be kept separate as to White and member of the Negro race, required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.180" offset="512084">But under his figures as to his tax abstracts, approximately 39% of the population of Lenoir County is comprised of member of the Negro race.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.998" offset="555342">We then turned to the clerk of the Superior Court, the Trial Court, the Court in which these defendants were tried and he said -- he testified that he had been clerk of that Court for 24 years and during that time one member of the Negro race had served or I believe the word he used, has served, he was not serving at the time these two defendants petitioners were indicted and tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.975" offset="663280">We think the question presented is -- boils down to simple question as to whether or not we carried the burden of proof of showing systematic exclusion of member of the Negro race from jury duty in Lenoir County, and we think we have without any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.978" offset="727333">And under numerous decisions of this Court, Eubanks and Hernandez case in particular, there are other cases, Hill against Texas and Smith against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.376" offset="776861">In the Hill against Texas case were 50,000 white persons, 8,000 Negros, if they pooled tax in Dallas County.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.381" offset="808939">In a period of 16 years no Negro had served on the Grand Jury of that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.203" offset="824195">The Court held that the petitioner made out a prima facie case of systematic exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.688" offset="850108">In Smith against Texas, petitioner showed 20% of the population was made up of Negros, 10% of the poll tax payers were Negros and from 1931 to 1938 there were 384 Grand Juries, out of which only five were Negros.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.900" offset="906951">There were 3,000 to 6,000 Negros qualified for Grand Jury service in Harris County.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.697" offset="926177">The Court says Chancellor Eisner alone could hardly have brought about the listing for Grand Jury service of so few Negros.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.853" offset="954807">As I say the question is simple, we think we have carried the burden of proof and we introduced the evidence we did in support of our motion, we think the burden then shifted to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.688" offset="994095">The state introduced no evidence whatsoever to refute the evidence we had put in as to the composition of the people, tax rolls of Lenoir County.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.483" offset="1081344">We could have brought the box in, but as it is handled in our county, our Board of County commission's the Governing Body, selects those people who are to serve on the jury, jury duty for up coming terms of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.942" offset="1147173">And I might say I recall the particular time when this one Negro served on Grand Jury and that was approximately, it was about seven or eight years ago from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.466" offset="1201194">They just have not had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.591" offset="1205687">We -- as the clerk testified usually for a term of Court we have about 35, possibly 40 jurors selected for a week's term of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.509" offset="1245393">And on numerous terms of Court we had no Negros whatsoever on the petit jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.780" offset="1466493">At the January term in Lenoir County, a criminal term we draw from the list of jurors someone for that term of Court, none names.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.556" offset="1517589">Now those names are made up like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.794" offset="1534516">The Sheriff types up a list of the perspective jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.858" offset="1566804">Then these lists, each little individual slip of paper with a name on it is torn off and put into a cigar box and then they have some little child come up and draw names out of the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.377" offset="1612884">Now, we do not know whether the Sheriff automatically eliminates the names of Negros, we don't know how it is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.106" offset="1647783">The only thing is we know it is done, because this thing couldn't happen by chance, not over the years and years with the population we have of Negros, it just wouldn't work.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.046" offset="1707551">No sir, we do not call him because if we had called the County Commissioners or if we had called the Sheriff we would have run into the same obstacle that they ran into the in the Eubanks case and I think also in the Hernandez case and maybe several other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.891" offset="1778918">As in the Eubanks case, they brought in the Jury Commission, five of them as I recall and I think some are made up of Judges and say they interviewed, they discussed, and they selected these jurors and say they would try to be fair and impartial in it and that's a far as they went.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.960" offset="1859166">But the Court in the case says, when a jury selection plan, whatever it is, operates in such as way as always to result in complete and long continued exclusion of any representative at all from a large group of Negros over any other racial group, indictments, and verdicts returned against him by juries thus selected cannot stand, and referring to what the Jury Selection Commission had to say, the Court said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.258" offset="1984449">True the Judges now serving on the local court testified generally that they had not discriminated against the Negros in choosing Grand Juries and had only tried to pick the best available, but the Court said if they were to hold -- go along with that idea or that testimony it would be a vein and illusory requirement that they have equal representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.064" offset="2075669">We think the matter is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.995" offset="2083401">We do not think it required a great deal of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.654" offset="2098030">We think the burden shifts to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.315" offset="2104613">The state did not meet its burden, we don't think it could have met its burden if it had tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.220" offset="5328227">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.208" offset="5340244">I was appointed by the Trial Court to defend the, defendant Jesse Jones, Jesse, not Jesse James but George Dixon in this particular case and we rely on the same arguments and the same cases as previously discussed here by Mr. Turner, who represents Jesse James Arnold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.814" offset="5426657">Therefore I'll not go into -- discuss the same aspects of the case probably I'll try to skirt around what he had to say and at the same time add my feelings or my thoughts on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.703" offset="5490186">It's been contended by the state that we should have gone forward and don't much bother than we did in our attempt to show discrimination in the selection of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.289" offset="5548492">In this particular case we do not deal with the petit jury at all, because a petit jury was drawn from another county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.476" offset="5577226">They, the Judge, the trail Judge ended an order seeking and requiring the clerk of Duplin County to furnish us with 200 special venire to try the case and they were gone from Duplin County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.093" offset="5635741">So only the grand jury of the Noah County is the jury we are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.228" offset="5652250">Now we showed by the testimony of the clerk the absence for a large number of years of all except for one person of Negro race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.404" offset="5700942">Now the state Court contented that we should have gone forward and shown why and we felt that that was a burden of the state and that, well when we showed we stopped and our motion was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.412" offset="5761024">The state went on said, while we didn't even show the constitution of the grand jury that indicted these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.127" offset="5795924">Well only one Negro had, had been served on the grand jury in 24 years previous it wouldn't make any difference whether he was on that particular grand jury or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.668" offset="5842004">So we didn't think it was necessary we showed the constitution of the grand jury that indicted these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.027" offset="5867499">However, I know for fact that that there was no Negro in that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.562" offset="5885576">I recall when the Negro did serve on the grand jury, just as -- and it was some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.983" offset="5907310">I also recall when the one served that was found to be a resident of Pitt country and was excused on the first day that that particular grand juror was appointed to the grand jury, he got up and said, I'd like to make a statement, and he said, I moved a few weeks ago, across the county line into Pitt county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.253" offset="5996335">Well he was off the grand jury and that was, he was summarily dismissed just like that, which he should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.018" offset="6027473">Therefore, based upon these arguments, we contend that we carried the burden of proof and that the case should be remanded for proceedings now in consistent with the rulings of this court in the Hernandez case and Eubanks case and various other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.978" offset="6491303">As recited in the order of the Court Mr. Chief Justice that they thought -- the judge thought in his discretion they should have a jury from another county to obtain a fair trail, as this murder was well known and communicated all around in Lenoir County and was fair to these defendants to have a panel of venire from another county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.968" offset="6579284">Now as to the jury, the Grand Jury, my friend recited a system about organizing the Grand Jury that I'm not familiar with at all, although I practiced law in North Carolina for over 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.331" offset="6664652">In the first place, I never knew that the sheriff made up the list, unless they've got a local statute they will show me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.337" offset="6692760">They have appended to their brief and we appended to our brief the same statues and they're in their appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.808" offset="6722644">Now the Board of County Commissioners has a clerk of it's own.</text>
