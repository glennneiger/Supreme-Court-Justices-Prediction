            <text syncTime="13.730" offset="158281">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.053" offset="183568">This case involves the question of the beneficial ownership of the United States Savings Bonds when there is encountered a conflict between the survivorship provisions of those bonds and the community property law, in this case of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.505" offset="265383">The case was heard in the trial court on stipulated facts which essentially are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.083" offset="291715">Angel and Pearle Yiatchos were married in Washington in 1943 and resided there as man and wife until the death of Angel in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.188" offset="344168">In 1950 and 1951, Angel Yiatchos, the husband, purchased the United States Series E Savings Bonds in question with community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.723" offset="402265">He named on each of these bonds as the POD or the pay-on-death beneficiary, his brother Gust Yiatchos.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.058" offset="447613">At the time of his death, Mr. Yiatchos left the will in which he bequeathed all of his bonds to six relatives including one -- among one of the six, his brother Gust who is also the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.714" offset="530265">The bonds were of the total value of approximately $15,000 out of an entire community estate of approximately $36,500, and it is stipulated that the bonds are not required for the payment of creditors' claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.802" offset="598601">There are three claimants to the bonds, the petitioner Gust Yiatchos who is the beneficiary named on the bonds, the -- the widow Pearle Yiatchos and the legatees under the last will and testament of Gust Yiatchos.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.752" offset="686373">The contentions of the parties are best illustrated by considering the three possible results which were available to the Court in resolving the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.187" offset="736110">If the survivorship provisions of the bonds were followed, the bonds would be awarded to Gust Yiatchos in their entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.042" offset="779577">If that should be construed to be a fraud on the widow, one half of the bonds could have been reserved or the equivalent in value could have been reserved to the widow by way of a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.897" offset="850944">If the purchasing of the bonds and the designate -- designation of the brother as beneficiary were held to be a complete fraud and void in its entirety, the widow would then receive her half interest in the bonds and the legatees under the will would take by a way of the will the remaining half interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.469" offset="957210">The trial court held that under the stipulated facts, this was in effect an attempted gift of community property and therefore, it was void in its entirety and the beneficiary designated on the bonds took nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.724" offset="1018232">The widow -- the bonds were held in trust for the estate which would give the widow her half interest and the other half interest would be distributed to the legatees named under the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.394" offset="1072985">The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of Washington and after it had been submitted to the Supreme Court on written briefs and on oral argument but prior to the decision of the state court, this Court decided the case of Free versus Bland which also involved the question of beneficial ownership of U.S. Savings Bonds in a community property law state, it having a reason out of Texas and the question there presented to the Court was whether the Treasury regulations governing survivorship, determined the beneficial ownership of the bonds or whether they were merely for the convenience of the Government in making payment, with the Government having no interest in who ultimately receive the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.648" offset="1309968">The Court held in Free versus Bland that the survivorship provisions and the Treasury regulations were a substantial feature of the bonds and intended to and which did make the bonds attractive to investors by virtue of the fact that it provided a very simple and efficient and quick way to transmit property on death and thus avoiding the -- and thus to avoid the complications and the delay and the expensive probate proceedings, that these features contributed substantially to the marketability of the bonds and consequently to the management of the National Death by the U.S. Treasury Department under the constitutional authority to borrow money on the credit of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.757" offset="1526366">The Court pointed out that under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, the relative importance to estate of its own state law is not material if it is in conflict with a valid federal law and stated this holding in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.621" offset="1601808">"We hold, therefore, that the state law which prohibits a married couple from taking advantage of the survivorship provisions of United States Savings Bonds merely because the purchased price is paid out of community property must fall under the Supremacy Clause.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="392.619" offset="1673801">The Court also indicated that there was an exception implicit in the bonds in the Treasury regulations so that the bonds could not become a sanctuary for fraud and that relief would be available under circumstances where fraud was -- or breach of trust was manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.466" offset="1765230">The Court indicated that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="423.009" offset="1795427">Yes, I understand that the Supreme Court of Texas determined that there were no allegations of fraud and therefore the decision in the U.S. Supreme Court was dispositive of the case and entered judgment accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.500" offset="1877347">The Court also indicated that the doctrine of fraud which would be applicable in this situation was the doctrine of fraud under federal law and cited in the footnotes, the cases of Clearfield Trust Company versus United States and Holmberg versus Armbrecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.670" offset="1958013">Following this decision, the Washington Supreme Court which had the case pending before it, decided in the instant case that the purchase of the bonds by the husband designating the brother as beneficiary was an attempt to convert community property into separate property and therefore, it was an effect a fraud on the wife and the purchase with the designation of the beneficiary was void ab initio and affirmed the trial court in its judgment that the named beneficiary on the bonds took nothing and that the bonds reverted to the estate with half to go to the wife and the other half ultimately to go to the legatees.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ernest R. Whitmore, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="514.145" offset="2159992">There is no statement and no -- no fact as to whether there was consent or not and the Court merely held in effect and it was a very brief opinion that in the absence of proof of consent that the mere purchase itself would constitute the constructive fraud as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.302" offset="2304606">The effect of this decision of the Washington Supreme Court is that a married person does not have the right to take advantage of the survivorship provisions of United States Saving Bonds when they're purchased with community property, which we argue is flatly contrary to the specific holding in Free versus Bland.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.590" offset="2401782">The Court purported to bring the case within the exception stated in Free versus Bland but in its effort to do so, I would suggest that it had the exceptions swallow the holding and that the decision can be construed in no other way than that community property law transcends the Treasury regulations pertaining to these survivorship provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.161" offset="2512018">With respect to the question of fraud, I would point out that there is no actual fraud contended for in the case, there were no allegations of actual fraud and there are no facts found upon which actual fraud could be said to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.157" offset="2603969">The only way that fraud can be considered to be present in this case is simply by holding as a matter of law that a member of the community cannot purchase U.S. Savings Bonds designating anyone other than his spouse as beneficiary or presumably co-owner if it were that type of bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.231" offset="2700309">In that regard, I would point out in the first place that the husband is the manager of the community property and as such, he has the right to handle the investments and to select the investments and this is regardless of either the knowledge or consent or even the objection of the wife.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.183" offset="2884106">I think that the purchase of the U.S. Savings Bonds in this situation involves both aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.385" offset="2904900">In the first place, they are bought by a living person with the contemplation of continuing to live for a substantial period of time and in this case, he did and in that sense during the continuance of his life and of the marriage, these represent a security and consequently an investment of the community and assets of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.296" offset="3004583">At the same time, either party to the community has the right to dispose of half -- not more than half of the community property by will and this in effect an alternative to a will by -- by way of making disposition of property on death.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.628" offset="3081906">So the U.S. Savings Bonds in this case are -- are in the first instance, an investment which the husband is authorized to make as manager of the community property and in the second place, they are a technique or a device whereby he may transmit his share of the community property on death.</text>

            <text syncTime="783.856" offset="3238745">Thereafter, the wife died and the husband claimed ownership of the bonds in their entirety and an heir of the wife claims that they should have remained part of her estate so that he could have inherited them.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.060" offset="3299662">In this case, the bonds were made payable to the brother as beneficiary and it is the wife who is claiming the bonds.</text>

            <text syncTime="825.917" offset="3407078">Our -- our position is that -- that the proper rule and that in seeking a uniform rule as the -- as the Court has indicated should be sought under federal law and citing the -- the Clearfield Trust Company case that this should not be left to state court decision but that the decision should here be made by this Court in this case and I will refer to that later and that a proper test in order to obtain a rule of uniformity rather than to leave it to the various decisions of the various state courts would be first to say that either there must be actual fraud or that there must be an attempt on the part of the offending spouse, if that is the proper term, an attempt on the part of the spouse by this device to dispose of more property than it could have by will.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.828" offset="3678647">And so long as he does not exceed that, it's our contention that there is no fraud because here, the husband could have disposed of half of the community estate amounting to in excess of $36,000 by will.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.910" offset="3746983">By the device of community -- of U.S. Savings Bonds, he has in effect attempted to dispose of less than that and therefore, it's our contention that this cannot be said to be a fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.624" offset="3977906">Therefore, I suggest that there is no reason why he should not be free to dispose of it by this method regardless of the consent of the wife.</text>

            <text syncTime="989.095" offset="4059721">I would certainly agree that he would be free to devote -- to invest the entire community estate in community -- in U.S. Savings Bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.231" offset="4096293">However, if he attempted to dispose of a greater portion of the community property by this technique then he could have disposed off by will then I think that you would become involved with a -- with a question of a fraud on the wife because she is entitled to her half of the community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.103" offset="4191796">Where it amounts to less than that, it's our position that there can be considered to be no fraud and that the status which the Washington Supreme Court has left us in is that a -- a husband has the right to dispose off half of his property by will, but that he can dispose of it only by will and that he can't utilize U.S. Savings Bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.099" offset="4307780">And in fact under the present situation of the law in Washington, an investment -- or the use of U.S. Savings Bonds is something which a married person should very carefully avoid because if he attempts to make a disposition by way of U.S. Savings Bonds, he has depleted his estate by the amount which he has invested in the bonds and that attempted disposition is held entirely void and so he has whatever might be left to dispose of by will which is less than he could have if he had not bought U.S. Savings Bonds at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.739" offset="4462320">So if this state of the law is permitted to continue, the attractiveness of U.S. Savings Bonds to people certainly in the State of Washington and potentially in other community property estates -- property estates has been very seriously diminished and damaged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.270" offset="8600430">We admit at this time that the record is not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.462" offset="8629269">Mr. Whitmore and I stipulated to all material facts and there are now facts that appear more material than they did in 1959 when we so stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.272" offset="8676498">However, the trial court made a founding -- a finding which in a sense is a finding that there was fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.486" offset="8725295">This was an attempted gift by a husband of what is stipulated to be community property, and this would be a -- a constructive fraud upon the wife if it was done without her consent, without her knowledge, without subsequent ratification by her or without consideration or benefit to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.336" offset="8852668">It seems to me that the trial court so found in its decision when it ruled that these were community property and the wife was entitled to one-half because any other ruling would have the effect of stating that it was separate property and the husband had a right to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.391" offset="8952978">I want to briefly outline what the state -- in the Supreme Court of State of Washington found in these matters after argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.242" offset="9004387">On page 19 of the record, Supreme Court says, "This purchase was in fraud of the rights of the respondent wife" and then after a test, this was a unilateral attempt to convert community property into separate property and void ab initio.</text>
