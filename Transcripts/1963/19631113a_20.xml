            <text syncTime="19.547" offset="182606">Yesterday when Court adjourned, I had been pointing out at least four factors which we were able to discern relative to the problem of securing equal representation among residence of different constituency and I want to touch on them just rapidly for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.014" offset="268497">First of course and the most obvious is the much discussed per capita representation, which is an important factor although by no means they seen a -- well, none nor to the starting point of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.146" offset="328997">But there is a second, third, and fourth -- there are second, third, and fourth factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.364" offset="349895">There should be some kind of minimum representation for voters of each county, that's an important ingredient.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.018" offset="376435">I suggest that also that it might be relevant in securing equal representation to impose some limit on the physical size of districts to prevent all the large sprawling districts, that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.121" offset="432859">And finally, that it was important to ensure proper diffusion of political power, so that no one small group of counties can ignore the needs of voters in the other counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.561" offset="482597">And I had started to suggest at the time of yesterday's recess that each of these is an important component in any concept of a truly viable apportionment system but ---</text>

            <text syncTime="171.934" offset="792095">And as matter of fact Mr. Justice Goldberg, I would say this, that if we take anyone of these components, we have been discussing, anyone of them conceivably, a constitutional standpoint might be selected as the basis upon which a state, in exercise of it's own discretion as to what it state requires may use as a sole standard if it desires to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.121" offset="900869">That would not necessarily and probably would -- that would not render it unconstitutional per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.233" offset="925320">But I would say that it's specious to suggest that any one factor should be used to the exclusion of others or be given a specific weight or you'd be used a starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.178" offset="989059">I would think that on the most circumstances, a state would have regard to a combination possibly, all of the factors which I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.577" offset="1030750">But no one stands out predominant, no one subordinates another.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.924" offset="1052066">It might for example be, you might have a situation of the state relying solely on the population standard, that in itself would not be unconstitutional nor would it be unconstitutional if a state relied let's say on the minimum guarantee of one -- of one representative for the voters of each county.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.036" offset="1348504">And while -- we would not go that far, there are these situations of extremes.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.849" offset="1631775">If that is what you meant, then I would say that this is not the equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.003" offset="1664376">Now, I would like to point out too that I see no warrant whatever for an argument such as the appellants and the Solicitor General made yesterday in their briefs to the effect that per capita representation should be the starting point of inquiry and the burden of justifying any variations from per capita representation should evolved on the state whenever the plaintiffs are able to show some disparity from a per capita standing and no more warrant for that approach than for making any -- any other ingredient, minimum guarantee of one representative per county for instance, the touchstone starting point of inquiry for determining whether an -- any -- whether an apportionment furnishes equal representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.291" offset="1881610">Now, in most states beyond any doubt, certainly in the fairly large and fairly populous -- heavily populous states, even apportionment in those states where to rely solely on per capita representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.970" offset="1936259">I suggest to the Court that if anything, it might be reason to suspect its efficiency as a vehicle for equal representation because of the problems of equality which were suggested in the argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.068" offset="1996654">And the state experience, in this field furnishes any guide, I think it would be most unusual or certainly more unusual to find sole adherence to per capita representation that defined for example, a guarantee of one representative per county.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.536" offset="2070528">And the critical thing is this, a very plain fact it seems to me is this, if the appellants are correct that the starting point of inquiry is per capita representation, then there is no doubt that they would succeed in making a prima facie case against virtually every state of the union simply on filing a complaint with statistic showing the disparities which inevitably are there, and I do not think that this can possibly accord with any known concept that what constitutes a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.950" offset="2224232">Take the case of New York for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.348" offset="2233741">If simply to tear a sheep out of some political scientist's textbook or to take a page from the legislative manual of New York with its recitation of figures will show that this State, 12th in the order of ranking on a per capita basis in the United States is prima facie and unconstitutional apportionment then indeed it squares with no concepts either of them as it come across --</text>

            <text syncTime="882.969" offset="3636308">I -- I suggest Mr. Justice Harlan that when I point up an example like St. Lawrence County and the larger 40th Senatorial District, I -- I do so to show as Mr. Justice Goldberg indicated yesterday that we're trying to prevent posing greater problems that already necessarily exist with all the well-directed efforts towards achieving equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.868" offset="3747903">We do not want to have this characterize our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.013" offset="3768487">Now, there is a third respect in which New York deviates somewhat from a per capita standard and that's the senate full-ratio rule which has the obvious purpose of ensuring proper diffusion of political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.785" offset="3827524">And I mentioned that specifically because Mr. Justice White, I would like if I might to answer more fully a question which you imposed yesterday and that was the question of "Why New York draws a line at a 6% figure?"</text>
            <text syncTime="947.024" offset="3892517">And I want to say to begin with, that there is no magic whatever in a figure of 6% itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.507" offset="3922401">In fact and this is very important, I think in answering that question, no such figure appears in our State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.407" offset="3954061">What our State Constitution does say and does provide is that any county having more than three senators shall obtain an additional Senator only on a full ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.296" offset="3997529">Now, since a full ratio obviously is -- is 1/50th of the citizen population, 50 being the basic number of senators and of course a county with more than three senators has more than 3/50th, so it's over 6% of the State's citizen population.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.213" offset="4065238">And getting back then to your question Mr. Justice White, "Why draw the line at counties having more than three senators?"</text>
            <text syncTime="998.060" offset="4096585">I suppose that when it comes to a drawing line to -- to a drawing of lines, there is no fixed answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.278" offset="4125529">But if we are correct in saying that it's permissible to place some limitation on per capita representation for the sake of other value, it does become necessary to draw a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.360" offset="4177878">And I say that it is surely as reasonable to draw a line at three senators as it would be the draw line at four or to draw a line at two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.108" offset="4212778">Or as it is as it surely is, the tax income at $600 or to tax it at $700 or to tax it at $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.880" offset="4255932">Now, if I may turn, there's one thing I want to try rapidly to do in the time remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.886" offset="4287906">We spoke yesterday of a constitutional convention and I just want to bring out one of two specifics on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.852" offset="4311834">Every 20 years, there are put -- there is put to the people a specific question, "Shall there be a convention to revise the Constitution?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.915" offset="4348092">And if a majority vote is cast in favor of holding a constitutional convention later, delegates or elected at a separate election, they are elected on the basis, number one, of three delegates per -- on the basis of senatorial districts, three times the amount of the senators from each district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.410" offset="4434087">In other words, each district has one senator, so there are three delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.475" offset="4450283">That would be three times 58 in the present apportionment, 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.425" offset="4470136">Plus 15 delegates elected at large, statewide which makes I think a total of 189.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.121" offset="4504931">Now, this 189 under the current apportionment, 81 would be elected from districts, from legislative districts contained within the five so-called full ratio counties and then of course the 15 at large delegates by the entire state and that would mean this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.136" offset="4596987">If the five full-ratio counties elect, they can control 81 plus the 15 at large because they are a majority of the voters of the State and they have a majority of the total of 189.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.586" offset="4650695">That is why I cannot understand what I regard as the erroneous contention made yesterday by the appellants that the counties pictured as the victims of discrimination were powerless to change the constitutional formula.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.159" offset="5125078">We were talking yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.666" offset="5131034">I started to talk yesterday about the reasons why federal equity power should not be used to intervene and no compelling circumstances, and the very same factors which in our view bear on the validity of the New York formula on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.233" offset="5201356">I've also suggested, there's no reason for intervention of federal equity power without repeating them in detail, close adherence to per capita representation, the clear control of the Legislature by urban counties, a built-in opportunity for the majority to change, to convene a constitutional convention and the consistent adherence by the Legislature to principle standards embodied in its Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.162" offset="5301039">All of these suggested, there's absolutely no warranty here for federal equity intervention, and that you have to look to the governmental processes of New York as a whole since the question of legislative apportionment after all is only one facet of the problem of giving citizens of the State an adequate voice in State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.337" offset="5389751">And I'll touch only on one aspect of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.461" offset="5402290">The Governor of the State of New York, not only as a chief executive as an -- the chief executive and administrative officer to the head of the State, but I would say without exaggeration, he is probably the most important element in the state legislative process and that's obvious because he prepares the budget.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="1606.348" offset="6529839">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.061" offset="6544677">We -- we have appeared before the Court on behalf, not only of the appellants, but also on behalf of the City of New York and the County of Nassau at the least in this case but who have supported the -- the positions of the appellants and we file briefs in that support and are represented by -- by counsel together with my co-counsel, Mr. Max Gross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.880" offset="6651883">The principal point which I would like -- I would like to make in the brief time remaining is that, even if it be assumed solely for purposes of argument that accessibility is a valid criterion, the senate rule was not designed with that criterion in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.037" offset="6764523">The operation of the senate rule is not such as to limit the geographical size of the senate districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.244" offset="6801408">The State's own examples of the large senate districts which exist under the formula indicate that fact in comparison of present senate districts with those in 1894 will show that in fact geography has been disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.149" offset="6881029">What the senate rule does is precisely what it was designed and intended to do to discriminate against the residence of the most populous areas with respect to their representation in the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.444" offset="6950201">The formula operates in such a way as I -- as I urged yesterday as to cause a disproportionate increase in the extent of overrepresentation of the rural areas as the most populous areas increase in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.092" offset="7028778">There are two rules with respect to the senate formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.970" offset="7048317">One is the full -- the senate expansion rule to which I have referenced yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.279" offset="7069529">There is another totally independent rule which is the full ratio rule which also discriminates against the residence of the most populous counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.519" offset="7110489">It was suggested yesterday in response to a question of Mr. Justice Stewart, that the -- that the inequities caused by the full ratio rule are corrected when a particular county achieves a full ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.387" offset="7169944">That maybe true but the basic inequity which causes the growing disproportion arises by virtue of a solely independent rule, the senate expansion rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.956" offset="7480174">Nassau County is a -- is a 6% county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.856" offset="7499818">It is discriminated against by virtue of the senate apportionment rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.249" offset="7545375">And therefore, although they are contiguous and although their circumstances are very similar, they are treated very differently by the Legislature simply because one falls in for the category of counties discriminated against and the other is not within that County -- not within that category.</text>
