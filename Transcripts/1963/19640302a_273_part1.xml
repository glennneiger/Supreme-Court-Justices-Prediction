            <text syncTime="26.760" offset="210422">This is a case which arises under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.098" offset="235813">And in this case, we are seeking review of a decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which set aside a decision of the Commission directing the respondents in this case, to maintain the 18-cent guideline price, at which we had temporarily certificated their sales pending the completion of the statutory hearing on their application for permanent certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.652" offset="394010">The reason why the Commission, in granting them a temporary certificate at 18 cents, said that, "Until we get finished with the hearing on the permanent certificate, you may not raise the price even though the contract here called for 20 cents."</text>
            <text syncTime="90.908" offset="467048">It was because the Commission found that collecting 20 cents during the period after the expiration of the five-month suspension period, the mere collection of 20 cents, even though it would be subject to refund would adversely affect the public convenience and necessity and substantially impair our ability to hold the line while we were making the inline determination which, of course this Court, directed us to do in the CATCO decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.400" offset="701001">And that was what -- and we said, we'll give you 18 cents which is our guideline price until we determine what the actual inline price is.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.113" offset="735796">The Court of Appeals, as I shall indicate later, didn't really disagree with our factual conclusion that allowing them to go up 20 cents would interfere with our ability to hold the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.567" offset="797654">But the Court believe that we were without power to do so because as they read the Act, Section 4 gives parties a legal right to file up to their contract right subject to the suspension provisions, which cannot be impaired by the exercise of the Commission certificate powers under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.828" offset="898696">So the issue is between the authority of a party to file up to his contract rate, under Section 4 of the Act and the authority of the Commission operating in its certificate powers at the threshold to say where there are good reasons to do so that for this particular period of time, you cannot collect up to your contract price.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.637" offset="1073925">And I will get it a little later as to why we thought that was an inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.388" offset="1088972">Now, there are seven sales involved in this proceeding, all of the various Hunt interests who are the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.728" offset="1134320">But the essential facts aren't in dispute and I think we can do what the court below did, use one set of the sales that of a Hassie Hunt Trust which appears roughly in the joint appendix from about page 48 to 150, as the example of what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.612" offset="1233795">Now, this sale results from a contract of December 15th, 1960 which is approximately three months after the Commission's Phillips case and three months after we issued our guideline prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.171" offset="1312057">The sale here was from the Alta Loma area of Galveston County, Texas, and was for gas at an initial price according to the contract of 20 cents with four-year periodic escalations of 2 cents each.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.812" offset="1414666">Three months before, in our statement of general policy, we had announced as the highest price which -- at which we would certificate in the absence of contest, any sale, new sale from this area at 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.108" offset="1491780">What's more?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.593" offset="1497736">A number of the interveners who have generally participated in these cases, some of the distribution companies and the New York Public Service Commissions specifically, had announced that in their view, the 18-cent price was too high, and that they were going to avail themselves of the right in the statutory hearing to contest as to whether that was in fact the proper inline price.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.752" offset="1598360">And they were claiming that the inline price was, I think, 14.6 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.674" offset="1622079">So it was perfectly clear when this sale was filed, that it was not going to be routine.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.648" offset="1653948">The statutory hearing was not going to be an automatic situation but was going to take considerable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.541" offset="1677563">It was going to be a contested one.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.253" offset="1688430">Recognizing this, the Trust and all the other respondents, exercised their rights under the Commission rules which are set out in our brief with page 45, Rule 15728, to seek temporary authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.118" offset="1779858">The Commission recognizing the particular problems of producers of natural gas has been very liberal in providing a mechanism whereby producers who wish to do so, can commence operation prior to the granting of a permanent certificate, of course subject to the outcome thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.388" offset="1872959">And, the Trust did in fact request a temporary certificate at the 20 cent price.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.824" offset="1934712">It depends on the circumstances of the case, if the problem -- if the case is not contested and unusually the contest is a matter of price, although not always.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.284" offset="1980479">If the matter is not contested under our present regulations which we put into effect about a year ago to take five weeks, it did take a little longer prior to that but never has taken more than about two or three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.669" offset="2038053">If it's contested, it takes considerably longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.596" offset="2053726">Now, it is a shortening period and I -- I can't really give you any norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.936" offset="2083088">And the reason for that is this, the -- this Court's CATCO decision in 1960, unfortunately, did not settle everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.751" offset="2122376">And the type of evidence and type of matters to be considered by the Commission in fixing the inline price has proven to be a very debatable matter as a result of a series of decisions in various Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.623" offset="2189876">We now, have got worked out a fairly streamline procedure and these inline price cases, the certificate cases, can go much faster than they did in this one which took considerable time, various blocks of proposed evidence are now excluded, at least with approval of the Circuit Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.163" offset="2272005">But even then, if it's a fully contested case and there are interveners as well, I think you can say that a year to 18 months is the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.079" offset="2323728">But at the earlier stages, it took longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.764" offset="2338461">And producers, a lot of producers would much rather start and take their risk rather than wait this period and as I say, the Commission has made it possible for them to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.039" offset="2615568">And the Commission on April 7th, 1961, granted them a temporary certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.674" offset="2654020">I'm reading from page 87 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.437" offset="2673142">But if you will look there, you will see that the Commission did not grant them a certificate for what they asked, not at the 20 cent price.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.440" offset="2713161">Instead, the Commission had three conditions in the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.404" offset="2733014">One, that the initial price should not exceed 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.569" offset="2753599">Two, that within 20 days, they should file new billing statements and rate schedules, so specify.</text>

            <text syncTime="681.550" offset="2829563">Now, the Trust actually begun operation pursuant to this temporary authority on April 19th, but we were not notified of that acceptance until May 5th, and the acceptance which was filed on May 5th was a very conditional acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.991" offset="2931336">In effect, what the Trust said was, "We don't think you have any authority do anything you've done and we're petitioning for rehearing of everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.835" offset="2966758">But we are willing to accept the 18-cent price for 30 days, provided you are willing at the end of that 30-day period to let us go back to our 20 cent contract price."</text>
            <text syncTime="733.463" offset="3037184">This, the Commission rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.644" offset="3049932">And on May 31st, and I'm reading from page 113 and 114 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.953" offset="3079189">The Commission wrote the Trust a letter explaining that this was not satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.000" offset="3107401">It said that the provision for charging 20 cents, 30 days after, is in conflict with the intent and purpose of the rate condition attached to the temporary condition and your acceptance is hereby rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.655" offset="3173961">It pointed out that, and I quote, "Conditions of a temporary authorization should be specifically complied with and compliance be without revised counter price for justice, which conflict with the purpose of the conditions."</text>
            <text syncTime="783.751" offset="3238327">And to make it perfectly clear, the condition itself, the first condition was modified to read that the total price should not exceed 18 cents with such rate to be effective for the duration of the temporary authorization and until a different prospective rate is established.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.618" offset="3837889">And then, I'm now going to read the very last four words in 147.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.621" offset="3865893">The Commission said, "The condition in the temporary authorization preventing you from charging or collecting," I'm reading at the top of page 148, "collecting more than 18 cents per Mcf."</text>
            <text syncTime="955.569" offset="3925661">During the term of that authorization, without expressing prior Commission approval is necessary to permit the Commission to carry out its duty to give careful scrutiny to producer prices in issuing permanent certificates citing CATCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.170" offset="4000057">If you were to be allowed to use the procedures of Section 4 (d) of the Natural Gas Act, during a period of your temporary authorization, the Commission could not prevent increased rates from becoming effective, even though those rates might irrevocably breach the price line or trigger price increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.196" offset="4088142">It has not been shown that the public interest would permit temporary authorization of the proposed sale without the condition heretofore specific right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.397" offset="4128998">And if, Your Honors, you will look back on page 146 of the paragraph of the bottom of that page, you will see that in this case, the Commission specifically referred to information in its files which indicated that this particular 20 cent price might have a triggering effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.973" offset="4227218">Not with respect to Natural Gas Pipeline because as Mr. Generelly will point out, they were already as of that time although subsequently not, receiving gas at 20 cents what as result of renegotiation provisions, which are generally the type where a contract provides that at set times, renegotiations may take place in a higher price fixed on the basis of the average prices of three or four other pipelines in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.864" offset="4350830">The Commission pointed to certain specific contracts which it felt, were in jeopardy of that type of thing if these higher rates went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.038" offset="4403493">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.440" offset="4441109">They agreed with the Commission or which they didn't disagree with the Commission as to the actual effect of allowing this rate to escalate the 20 cents on 30 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.710" offset="4506206">They said of course, and I'm reading from page 333 of the record, of course that makes maintenance of the price line something less than completely effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.773" offset="4550510">But the Court felt that -- and again I am quoting, "This was the unavoidable consequence of a unique statutory regulatory scheme in which," citing this Court's decision in the Mobile case at 350 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.974" offset="4623235">As Mobile points out, rates are initially prescribed and increased by private contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.370" offset="4656880">It felt that this Court's decision in the CATCO case, which of course is subsequent to Mobile, which has said that the Commission can and may prescribe price conditions, only authorized us to prescribe initial price conditions which would set a floor, and would not allow us to go beyond that to establish anything which would last more than the 30 days or five-month suspension period necessary to implement the price raising procedures of Section 4 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.218" offset="4816227">Specifically, as the Court phrased it, not everything is lost since, as CATCO contemplated, any contract increases are collected subject to refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.484" offset="4889266">In other words, the Court of Appeals basically held that Section 4 of the Act gives what they described as a right to a party to file an increase rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.149" offset="4955930">And Section 7 of the Act, which gives the Commission authority to grant certificates where the public interest is -- public convenience and necessity requires and authorizes us to condition certificates as the public condition -- convenience and necessity requires, cannot be used to interfere with this supposed right to file price increases up to the contract rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.163" offset="5208064">Your Honors' decision made clear, and I'm reading from page 339 of the opinion which begins on 350 U.S. of 332.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.360" offset="5308792">Any more than 4 (c) purports to define what constitutes a contract with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.432" offset="5333138">The Section says only that a change cannot be made without proper notice to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.477" offset="5357275">It does not say under what circumstances a change can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.561" offset="5385592">Now, as I will indicate, it is our contention that there is another, inhibition on the right of parties to file rate increases, that the Congress did not leave the limitation of this right to private contract that is a limitation but super imposed on that limitation by Section 7 of the Act as expressed amended in 1942, is the authority of the Commission in appropriate circumstances where there is a good reason to do so to also limit this right and that of course is the knob of this issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.873" offset="5570853">Let me refer to the CATCO case, which I think is really the prime case in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.162" offset="5608051">And I'm reading from Justice Clark's decision on page 388 of the decision which begins at 360 U.S. 378.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.000" offset="5675342">And there, he starts with the premise, that the purpose of the Natural Gas Act is to underwrite just and reasonable rates to the consumers of Natural Gas, and the Act was so framed as to afford consumers a complete, permanent and effective bond of protection from excessive rates and charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.605" offset="5769801">I'll repeat that because that basically is the knob of our case here today, a complete, permanent and effective bond of protection from excessive rates and charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.963" offset="6163205">The CATCO case, I hope I'm not confusing the Court by referring to this decision as CATCO which is a trade term, it's the Atlantic Refining Company case, went on subsequent to spell out the Commission's powers under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.886" offset="6238960">And I'm reading now from page 391 where Justice Clark said, after indicating that Section 7's powers are more important during this formative period when ground rules of producer regulation are being an evolved, said, "Where the application on its phase or on presentation of evidence, signals the existence of a situation that probably would not be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.092" offset="6355780">A permanent certificate should not be issued, but then recognizing that execution maybe too hard a remedy."</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.721" offset="6390262">He went onto say, where -- there is of course available on such a situation a method by which the applicant and the Commission can arrive at a rate that isn't keeping with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.312" offset="6440626">The Commission has authorized the -- the Congress has authorized the Commission to condition certificates, where the proposed price is not in keeping with the public interest because it is out of line as this was, or because its approval might result in triggering of general price rises as the Commission found these words, or an increase in the applicant's existing wage by reason of favored nation clauses or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.916" offset="6551071">The Commission, in the exercise of its discretion, might attach such conditions as it believes necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.942" offset="6595166">And there's more to the CATCO case but basically, that's what the situation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.876" offset="6618885">Now, it's argued by the respondents and it was argued in the court below that CATCO despite this language does not authorize the Commission to have a fixed limitation for any duration of time beyond the five month suspension period on a price increase, because of certain language in the CATCO case which indicates that there was no such limitation in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.583" offset="6749706">But we believe that both CATCO and the statutory scheme cannot be so narrowly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.102" offset="6779800">The CATCO situation after all, was a case in which the Commission was claiming that there was no need, they should be claiming at the Commission level, that there was no need for any condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.423" offset="6829014">And the people who were arguing before this Court, for some price condition, assumed that a refund obligation of the type which had been originally suggested to the Commission would be adequate</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.756" offset="6902366">It was, therefore, quite appropriate for this Court to make the same assumption and to point out quite correctly that under the particular condition in the CATCO case, they could file an increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.569" offset="6949700">But that, we do not believe means that they could never file an increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.330" offset="6968717">If the Commission could, as it has subsequently done, find that the mere collection of a price, subject to refund, would have the same, or not quite the same, would have adverse effects on its ability to maintain the price line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.250" offset="7052413">I backtrack fast there because obviously, I'm not suggesting that refund obligations are of no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.286" offset="7084492">They are of real value and a refund obligation is much better than a situation without a refund obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.528" offset="7113435">But as this Court recognized, just the last term, in the Tennessee Gas case, refunds, though useful, though valuable, are far from a complete protection to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.452" offset="7169128">That particular case happened to involve the consumer's end of the refund directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.732" offset="7194311">And, Justice Clark's decision there noted, the obvious fact that when three or four years later, you ought a refunds to go back to the public, they just don't all get back.The public has moved away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.247" offset="7260348">Some of the public isn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.915" offset="7267035">The expenses of ordering refunds are such that a -- inevitably no matter how hard the Federal Power Commission and the State Commissions try and we've been trying and spending a great deal of out time on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.823" offset="7318653">Inevitably, refunds do not fully protect the public in that sense.Mr. Solomon, supposing the Commission felt that a permanent -- a permanent certificated company was filing too many applications and it took an applications and said, "Alright, we will grant you these inquiries on condition however, that you don't file further applications at more frequent periods and five year intervals," could it -- would it have the Commission has the power to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.686" offset="7702131">In the Third Circuit, in the case -- Panhandle case recited at 203 F.2d, threw it out on the grounds that this is not a proper use to Section 4 (d), but the Commission does have authority when it is granting a certificate to change the terms of the contract of which price of course is an important but not the only one to require where the public interest so requires, that it will not certificate the sale at all unless the contractual terms upon which it is granted or changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.899" offset="7850924">Similarly, in the Alabama, Tennessee case cited in our brief, there we had granted a new pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.164" offset="7904005">It's quite analogous to this case because it -- it's somewhat like the temporary situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.867" offset="7934830">There, we had granted a new pipeline certificate powers but we couldn't agree upon the rates, so we just told them to put in a temporary rate until such time as they could decree on a permanent rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.195" offset="7988120">And before they could file that and agree with us on the permanent rate, they tried to use Section 4 (d) to raise the interim rate on 30 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.810" offset="8034617">And Judge Hastie, in the case cited there in our brief, Judge Hastie of the Third Circuit threw it out again and I'm quoting from page of our brief saying that, "To treat the interim rate permitted as the kind of rate which is subject to change on the free initiative of the Company under Section 4 (d), is to ignore the restrictive context in which it was allowed to become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.857" offset="8158751">Only after such an initial determination with satisfactory rate could the Company properly claimed that it was operated under the kind of tariff that is subject to change by Section 4 (d) procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.040" offset="8211519">Once the Commission, Justice Harlan, certificates a sale permanently, once after a hearing, the Commission permanently certificates its sale, its authority to change the contractual provisions upon which that sale is certificated is very circumscribed, if it exist at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.282" offset="8320502">And I am not arguing here that if we allow a permanent certificate to go through and do not condition it, that we can subsequently say, "You can't exercise your powers under Section 4 (d)."</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.226" offset="8376299">I am arguing that the whole reason why Congress, in 1942, amended the certificate provisions of the Natural Gas Act and amended them to give us this conditioning power and to spell out the reasons why we could deny certificates, was as the House Committee made clear at that time -- and I'm reading from page 26 of our brief."</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.190" offset="8504090">The bill when enacted will have the effect of giving the Commission an opportunity to scrutinize the financial setup, the adequacy of gas reserves, the feasibility and adequacy of proposed services, and the characteristics of the rate structure in connection with the proposed construction or extension at a time when such vital matters can be readily modified as the public interest may demand."</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.431" offset="8617148">This is the point of Congress giving us these additional powers in 1942 because it had developed for that without these powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.626" offset="8661870">The Commission could not prevent the certification of operations which later proved to be unwarranted, unused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.505" offset="8737416">I was discussing the difficulties with the refund conditions and I do not want to rely solely on the Tennessee case because, although I think this is important and I do not mean to underestimate it, is by no means the only problem with refund conditions in this particular context of producer sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.465" offset="8837204">They're at least two other difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.661" offset="8850056">In the first place, as I must say Justice Clark pointed out I think fairly last year in his dissent in the Wisconsin case, I don't agree with all of it but this point, I think would certainly sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.921" offset="8915048">The mere collection of high prices in the field which are going to at least be that high for a year or so, have traditionally -- it has been found as the Commission pointed out in the language I read you earlier, resulted in raising the general price structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.604" offset="8997804">And the fact that these prices maybe subject to refund at some later date does not prevent that from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.853" offset="9030823">This is a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.607" offset="9033749">This is what has happened time after time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.546" offset="9049527">If the prices go up, there are various reasons why other prices will go up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.202" offset="9064155">One of them, we pointed out in our brief, is the strange "Tinker to Evers to Chance" situation resulting in the effect of an interstate price on intrastate prices which in turn affect interstate prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.255" offset="9124342">So the mere collection of higher prices in the field, inevitably have the effect of raising the field prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.525" offset="9169481">More important perhaps, again as we point out in our brief, you have the potential triggering effect of one group of high prices on other groups of high prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.654" offset="9217964">Now gentlemen, theoretically, if the triggering price is subject to refund, you might think that this whole house of cards would automatically collapse if and when you can get rid of this high triggering price at some subsequent time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.933" offset="9303124">Believe me, it doesn't happen that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.529" offset="9317439">All sorts of things can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.381" offset="9328933">We have an -- a very good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.783" offset="9346487">We have a series of sales which were made in the early 90 -- late 1950s in Southern Louisiana at a very high price, I think about 23 and a half cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.636" offset="9405942">All of which were subsequently set aside by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.437" offset="9429138">But in the meantime, they had triggered a substantial number of other sales in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.813" offset="9458604">And these other sales were in various postures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.677" offset="9470098">Some people had triggered up to the higher rate and then had renegotiated their contracts and gotten rid of further escalations at a later date in response to a fixed price at this triggered price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.227" offset="9536240">Do they have contract authority?</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.345" offset="9544704">Maybe they are now the basis for the other triggered sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.025" offset="9559437">Other people had gotten a permanent certificate by mischance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.622" offset="9585873">They'd gotten a permanent certificate because the Commission had tried to reject the certificate and in turn it turned out that they were not rejectable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.564" offset="9613667">They're only suspendible but by the time we tried to suspend them it was too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.003" offset="9631431">There are other circumstances in which that I could go through but the fact is that once the genie is out of the bottle, I won't say you can't get them back, but I will only say is that, the Commission has not found Aladdin's magic word to get him back yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.105" offset="9699767">What's more?</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.763" offset="9710425">We're making an assumption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.003" offset="9719411">We're making an assumption that we will get him back in the bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.936" offset="9739160">Now, maybe we will but maybe we won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.225" offset="9752221">One of the respondents here is Caroline Hunt Sands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.449" offset="9781164">Now, Caroline Hunt Sands -- now, in the form of Caroline Hunt Sands doing business with her husband is claiming in a new Commission proceeding not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.601" offset="9837798">That she has cost, if you want to consider her own private cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.920" offset="9863084">Well, she has various types of cost but the minimum she claims is about 33 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.513" offset="9897462">Now, I don't know whether this is right or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.876" offset="9906866">I think we are arguing that it's not right but it illustrates the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.779" offset="9930480">It's possible that a given producer, because of a number of dry holes or other reasons, will have very high cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.179" offset="9960051">And it's possible that a producer with very high cost will be able to induce as Caroline Hunt Sands' unfortunately has, produced pipelines to certificate her at contract prices, which are higher than any other price in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.937" offset="10027133">How are we going to get that back into the bottle?</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.604" offset="10069765">Basically, I think the respondents here are claiming a right, an absolute right to be certificated at any price which is just and reasonable in terms of their own cost of service including a reasonable return.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.890" offset="12306892">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.115" offset="12323819">Considerable amount of water has gone over the dam in the 10 years, since this Court's decision in Phillips versus Wisconsin, most of it, in the last four now almost five years since CATCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.576" offset="12377631">In the course of this 10 years since first Phillips, the producing industry as a whole has experienced what it means to be regulated and it has not been easy nor pleasant experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.494" offset="12429354">It may therefore seem somewhat paradoxical that respondents in this case who are independent producers and at one time believed themselves exempt from regulation of the Federal Power Commission, are here today before this Court contending for nothing more nor less than the right to be treated as natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.269" offset="12512423">Briefly stated, it is our position as this Court has held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.631" offset="12533948">But I -- if a producer of gas become subject to the duties, obligations and restraints imposed on Natural Gas Companies by Congress under the Natural Gas Act, once he begins his sale in interstate commerce, then he should be entitled at that point to the rights accorded and reserved to Natural Gas Companies by Congress under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.672" offset="12614092">Now, we believe the court below is eminently correct and so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.558" offset="12633631">The Commission relies hardly enough on the same cases on which we rely, CATCO and Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.313" offset="12680652">We are inclined to believe that the Commission has misread both decisions or at least has ceased upon certain language, certainly in CATCO, and misused it really out of context to support his position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.010" offset="12739375">Now, we quoted that some length in our brief from the Court's decision and I must apologize for that, say if -- it seemed to be so clear to us that I -- I didn't know how else to state it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.711" offset="12806248">Now, one thing I did not quote, but I would like to review very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.231" offset="12836342">To begin, in CATCO that either 3 -- 360, 388, or 389, Justice Clark stated that "The heart of the Act is found in all those provisions requiring initially that any proposed service, sale, operation, construction, extension or acquisition will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity, and that all rates, charges made, demand of the receipt shall be just and reasonable."</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.956" offset="12959222">This was 1938, about 65 years ago where it shall be just and reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.123" offset="13019826">Thank you, Mr. Solomon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.395" offset="13028916">The Court went on to say that the Act prohibits such movements of gas unless and until the Commission issues a certificate of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.381" offset="13056920">The Court notes that Section 7 (c) vest on the Commission control of the conditions under which gas maybe initially dedicated to interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.937" offset="13095163">And then once so dedicated, there can be no withdrawal of that supply from continued interstate movement without the Commission's approval."</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.884" offset="13126928">Now, the very next sentence, the gas operator, although to this extent, of captive subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission is not without remedy to protect himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.333" offset="13160678">What is that remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.994" offset="13167365">He may, unless otherwise bound by contract, not with Commission permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.419" offset="13189099">He may, unless otherwise bound by contract citing Mobile, file new rate schedules with the Commission, having once started at a lower conditioned price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.668" offset="13226088">This rate becomes effective upon its filings, submit five months suspension period of -- of Section 4, the posting of a bond were require.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.690" offset="13258167">This not only gives the natural gas company opportunity to increase its rates were justifying, and bear in mind, the Commission has never found in this particular case whether it was justified or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.884" offset="13302888">They simply rejected our filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.858" offset="13318771">But likewise, guarantees that the consumer may recover refunds for moneys paid under excessive increases, the overwriting of intent of Congress to give full protective coverage to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.757" offset="13358373">As to prices, further emphasized in Section 5 of the Act which authorizes the Commission sua sponte or otherwise but not -- would not be so naive, as to suggest on the request of a producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.269" offset="13408423">But sua sponte or state commission to somebody under Section 5, to institute an investigation and to existing rates and charges and to fix them to a just and reasonable bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.388" offset="13440920">The Court found that under this Section however, the rate found by the Commission to be just and reasonable, comes to effect only prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.921" offset="13471013">Gas purchasers, therefore, have no protection from excessive charges collected during the pendency of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.553" offset="13489612">Now, in this case, first let me say, if I understand the English language, I will say that there is nothing in the legislative history of the Natural Gas Act as I have read it nor any case cited by this Court which lends any support whatsoever for the proposition that an agency may condition out, write out, and nullify that all practical effects the Section of the very Act, it was required by Congress to administer, and that I respectfully submit is what they've done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.140" offset="13635897">Now, the Court is aware of its own decisions and I won't spend anymore time on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.095" offset="13651780">I respectfully suggest that the Commission is wrong on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.067" offset="13663692">So let's get to the factual part of this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.040" offset="13683545">This has a somewhat complicated beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.931" offset="13863058">Now, the cases that are actually involved here are the so-called "CI dockets" and that means certificate independent producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.418" offset="13905063">In the interim period, the Commission adopted a new method of designating these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.032" offset="13923453">So in all subsequent proceedings, it has been convenient to refer to the G numbers or the G dockets and the CI dockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.559" offset="13953651">We have to start with the G dockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.129" offset="13967862">In May of 1959, after eight years of putting together a rather large package, to we use that phrase, of gas, these producers, not all of them, and some others who are not here, entered into a series of long, firm contracts, the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America to sell gas from a number of fields in the Texas Gulf Coast at a price of 20 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.847" offset="14070784">Sales had been previously certificated in the same fields, from the same wells, permanent certification to another pipeline at 20 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.592" offset="14117700">The contracts provided these were the May 1959 contracts for four -- for a two-cent escalation every four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.726" offset="14150301">The producers including Hassie Hunt Trust in G 19115 -- remember Hassie Hunt Trust is also here in this case under a CI docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.487" offset="14181334">Hassie Hunt Trust in that case, to use -- again, we can use the same example, did not ask for a temporary certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.239" offset="14208293">It went to a full hearing and a hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.337" offset="14220727">Now, this gas is sold in Chicago, none of it goes to the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.976" offset="14239326">The Public Service Commission of New York sought to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.676" offset="14250088">The Commission denied them intervention on the grounds that they couldn't possibly be aggrieved in the sense that nobody in New York would be aggrieved by the price of gas in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.090" offset="14283734">They were excluded from intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.210" offset="14296168">Permanent certificates were issued requiring that the periodic escalations in the future be modified to conform to the Trunkline pattern which was an increase, one increase after 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.476" offset="14369311">With serious misgivings and reservations, the respondents, some of them there, Hassie Hunt Trust among others, sought rehearing for testing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.242" offset="14404315">I say serious reservations because as the court below found if you seek rehearing, the chances are things may get worse rather than better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.028" offset="14431483">And sure enough, they got worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.454" offset="14441200">The Commission reduced the 20-cent price with respect to sales and a couple of other districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.873" offset="14462830">Well, it said you can -- we'll put back in your periodic escalations in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.265" offset="14480384">In any event, this gas had been in the making as it were this project for some eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.168" offset="14508074">So the producers accepted the certificate, began their sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="3617.508" offset="14573380">It didn't have the certificate order before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.218" offset="14584247">Nothing was said about it, Judge Fahy said, "Why do you want to get into that proceeding?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.675" offset="14602115">He said, "So I can take an appeal from it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.755" offset="14618415">In the mean time, Hassie Hunt Trust and the other producers who are here under the CI dockets had drilled additional wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.990" offset="14651329">And I might say, though this isn't revealed by the record, I -- it maybe somewhere in here but that they drilled them more or less an expectation that the 20-cent price would make it worthwhile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.617" offset="14685811">It cost about $2000 a day to maintain a drilling well out in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.477" offset="14709321">And these, respondents here, have spent about $10 million a year looking for gas and oil to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.547" offset="14737533">But they've got to think in terms of what it's going to cost to bring this forth and then what they're going to get in return over a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.924" offset="14771075">We went to Natural Gas Pipeline, it was logical, and said, "We've drilled additional wells in the same fields."</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.985" offset="14799287">Let's put them under the same contract which we had originally proposed and we'll see immediate certification to start selling the gas because remember, in these same wells, gas is being sold at Trunkline Gas Company, and we're being drained to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.017" offset="14871489">Natural Gas Pipe isn't going to get the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.455" offset="14881207">So we ask for the temporaries and now went to the CI dockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.216" offset="14900224">Now, the Commission gives us our temporary, it says 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.439" offset="14921122">In the intervening period, we'd have the statement of general policy which certain guideline rates and which the Commission would govern itself in conditioning initially without a -- or certificating without an initial price condition if the price were below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.101" offset="14991757">And in the case of rate increase filings, if it is above, they would suspend, if it was below, they wouldn't suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.805" offset="15014640">In the intervening period between the G dockets, the time that gas was on the screen on the permanent certificated -- certificates in the CI dockets, the statement of general policy came down, so the Commission gave us a temporary at 18 cents but we couldn't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.754" offset="15074408">We could understand why they would do it under the statement of general policy but where the same producers -- the same producers from the same wells in many cases, in the same field were selling gas at 20 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.013" offset="15131460">Oh it's triggering, how could there be any triggering?</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.554" offset="15141595">If there was any triggering that occurred with respect to the G dockets, it couldn't, with respect to ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.953" offset="15163225">One of the very nature of the favor nations, there isn't any new pipeline, purchasing gas at a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.108" offset="15195826">As for redetermination, that would have occurred in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.526" offset="15209514">As far as I know, I don't' understand the general counsel to state that there has been any redeterminations as a result of this, but in any event, we sought rehearing, we said it's unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.426" offset="15245040">Now, one thing I'd like to make very clear and I think we have, and the court below recognized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.483" offset="15265311">Respondents here do not question the right of the Commission in keeping with the mandate of the Court in CATCO to impose initial price conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.921" offset="15303032">But we say that a condition must be reasonable and the circumstances must warrant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.437" offset="15321109">Here, we thought they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.277" offset="15324453">We sought rehearing, rehearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.291" offset="15340544">We proposed, based on a number of recent Court of Appeals decisions and citing the nature of the Commission's regulatory powers under 4, 5 and 7, that if they were going to condition the price down would give us as in the alternatives suggested in CATCO, a 1-day suspension, we actually said a 30-day suspension to take care of the statutory 30-day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.567" offset="15465618">Well, this is what we came out and we finally did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.307" offset="15472619">We said, "Let us collect it and we'll agree to refund it with 7% interest."</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.121" offset="15495816">Commission says no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.177" offset="15504071">Not only, we're not going to give you that but you can't proceed under Section 4 where the same thing would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.128" offset="15531865">We would give 30 days notice, we'll put it into effect and -- and depending however many years, intervening period why we would collect it, subject fully to refund under Section 4 pending the determination under other Section or Section 7 or 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.445" offset="15617128">Under 7, whether the price was required by the public convenience and necessity or the sale at that price or under Section 4 whether it was just and reasonable, because absent the right to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.995" offset="15659342">This is our remedy to protect ourselves as it -- as Justice Clark said in CATCO and that Justice Brennan the next year, emphasized in Sunray Mid-Continent, unless we can do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.469" offset="15705213">What is going to happen to us if at the conclusion of the hearing on the permanent, and I might point out that this will fall in 1961 and we still don't have a permanent certificate and we're still operating under the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.067" offset="15771669">True, we asked to have the CI dockets deconsolidated from the G dockets, and we had a very good reason for that which I will come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.578" offset="15801657">But we're still operating on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.773" offset="15806464">Now, suppose that the -- when we finally do get the certificate or in some subsequent area rate proceeding under Section 5, the Commission's rate power is being prospective only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.678" offset="15874069">What happens to us after -- if the Commission says, "My gosh!</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.397" offset="15892982">You were right all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.635" offset="15901863">We've lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.349" offset="15908760">There's not a way and to where we can get it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.101" offset="15919731">This is a wasting asset."</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.778" offset="15930493">And around eight years, most of the gas involved here is going to be gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.044" offset="15943555">Now, I say eight years because -- let's get back to the G dockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.291" offset="15964557">We had our hearing after the New York Commission was allowed to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.670" offset="15978036">New York Commission did not offer any evidence, didn't -- say all they said was, "The price was too high in the area."</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.443" offset="16001128">So we said, "Alright, we'll introduce evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.882" offset="16010951">What sort of evidence should we introduce?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.484" offset="16021295">The Commission said, "That is for us to know and you to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.186" offset="16036133">All we will assure you is, you have the widest latitude."</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.535" offset="16049507">We'd said, "Should we do it on individual cost basis, shall we do it in the individual economics of the particular producing area or shall we do it for the whole area?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.519" offset="16081481">The Commission says, "Do it anyway you want."</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.725" offset="16094229">So we put in a very large case on -- in every way we could figure that was thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.247" offset="16124322">And what we did was to go on what has come to be known as the inline doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.555" offset="16145638">Now, with all respect to Justice Clark and certainly to the Court, there had been more things said and done in the name of inline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.889" offset="16182941">It says 1959 that I -- than any producer, believe me, he has to think about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.120" offset="16199868">It has become a virtual cult.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.704" offset="16210213">The way we determine whether a sale is required for the public convenience and necessity at a particular price, and bearing in mind that the Court said, "You don't have to make a rate case out of it," that's alright with us, that cost to put it in a rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.323" offset="16268622">But what we do is to take all of the contracts executed in the year in which you executed your contract, where three years later in a hearing, let's take them and that indicates if you are willing at that time to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.077" offset="16331630">Alright, we will automatically take all those contracts and those which are not -- are not the subject of permanent certification, get rid of them, put them to one side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.188" offset="16380113">Any that have been subject to court review, propose to one side, even though there has been no evidence and no hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.633" offset="16409893">And then any other price that looks like a price to which somebody has said, "We don't think it's in the public interest."</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.743" offset="16438314">They put that aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.274" offset="16444479">So we eventually get this thing down to something that is back around 19 -- somewhere between 1954 and 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.448" offset="16473213">Now, the producers have argued that this, the sales to take into account, what the Ninth Circuit said was important."</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.765" offset="16506441">Gas moving today in substantial quantities, what's the price?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.091" offset="16519711">But more importantly, in CATCO, the Court expressed surprise that if there had been evidence available of deeper drilling cost, in the Gulf of Mexico, it wasn't offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.318" offset="16560671">The Commission today would not look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.272" offset="16572479">They simply takeaway the average and they say, "This is the public convenience and necessity price, here is your permanent certificate."</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.470" offset="16609259">What have we got then?</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.470" offset="16613230">They may reduce our price to be sure but what have we got then, we didn't have when we started on the temporary?</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.102" offset="16631829">We can't stop and the Commission has never refused to grant a permanent, after having once permitted the sale to begin under a temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.666" offset="16665997">Never.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.529" offset="16669445">It has taken the position, we don't have the authority to do so absent, the producer coming and filling application under Section 7 (b) of the Act to abandon it which conceivably would be opposed by pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.273" offset="16708420">And who is to say, the Commission would say, "We -- we figure you're right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.795" offset="16722526">The gas isn't needed."</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.380" offset="16728900">When the pipeline initially, has said, "The gas is needed."</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.395" offset="16740916">The pipelines are market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.397" offset="16744991">What market showing do we make?</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.312" offset="16752619">We come in with the contract that indicates the pipeline needs the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.353" offset="16764740">The only question in an initial certification for producer sale is the question of initial price to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.770" offset="16794415">That is the only question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.647" offset="16801938">Now, the Commission, interestingly enough in this case, I think has more or less abandoned its original argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.112" offset="16839868">Certainly -- it doesn't press it with the same vigor that there is a difference between a temporary producer and a permanent producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.481" offset="16873305">They can't very well say that he isn't subject to all the same restraints and duties and obligations of the Act, he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.503" offset="16901413">He can't abandon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.087" offset="16907682">He has to give notice anytime he wants to increase his price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.633" offset="16925863">He can be told virtually what to do, when to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.391" offset="16936939">There he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.247" offset="16944358">Now, what the Commission has shifted to now is, that embarked as they are on area rate making, in the area of approach that at least with respect to all new certificated sales, they're going to stop a moratorium, and they say it was specified period of time until in the case of South Louisiana, I think it's still 1967 or the conclusion of the South Louisiana area proceeding, whichever is earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.852" offset="17078732">They have Monday of last week, a week ago today, imposed now a moratorium on the Texas Gulf Coast saying, "Until the conclusion of a recently instituted proceeding, AR 642 or until January 1, 1968, you can't increase the price above 19 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.919" offset="17155009">This still isn't the 20 cents."</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.656" offset="17162010">You can't fall for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.517" offset="17165458">We're just going to reject it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.001" offset="17171414">Here's your certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.857" offset="17182804">We can't reject that certificate, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.718" offset="17202239">We have the right to reject the initial certificate they gave us back in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.841" offset="17218748">We could have elected not to start our sale because the New York Commission was clamoring to be permitted to intervene, and it had a right to intervene, we don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.493" offset="17253334">But were we to hold off for a full year and a half, the completion of judicial review and the people of Chicago, Chicago -- we understand from Natural Gas Pipeline needed that gas, we had to sell it for we to hold off, and now, since we can't abandon, the Commission can declare a moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.615" offset="17329821">Now, really let's get down to what the reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.593" offset="17337762">It doesn't matter if it's still January 1, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.124" offset="17351868">It doesn't matter if it's a year, two years, three years, four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.849" offset="17374751">The Commission -- the members of the Commission fired men no matter how sincerely dedicated and desires of -- of -- carrying out the mandate of the Court in CATCO, the general purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.309" offset="17428564">They are only men, and they may not be in office five years from now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.957" offset="17447163">Now, what is to say if it -- and proceeding has not been concluded and these proceedings are monstrous, large.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.965" offset="17475271">What is to say to prevent them from saying, "We have determined that we better go for another four years or two more years, find out for the life of the contract, what happens to the contract incidentally?</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.055" offset="17531591">We have to file a contract you know," and I say we, producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.429" offset="17545070">The produce -- I'd like to see what would happen frankly if a producer came in with a tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.716" offset="17558235">He can't file a tariff, pipelines file tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.605" offset="17569834">A pipeline can file tomorrow for whatever it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.979" offset="17579238">The Commission sets a time for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.969" offset="17591254">The same Court, in Alabama Tennessee that they rely on, and Mississippi River Fuel said, "There wasn't a color of statutory authority, looking at the Commission's action and rejecting a pipeline rate-filing."</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.491" offset="17637334">And incidentally, this is interesting to me, the Commission has not relied on the broad powers of Section 16 of the Act, which gives it the authority to issue all orders to implement and carry out the other purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.757" offset="17686444">It hasn't relied on it and I suspect principally, because Wilmette, the Wilmette case in the District of Columbia and this Court denied certiorari, said Section 16, with all its broad grant, would not give the authority to reject a rate-filling, citing this case in this Court's decision in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.620" offset="17761886">Now, what is the answer?</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.897" offset="17767006">The Commission doesn't need the powers it's contending for, it doesn't need them in case of permanent certification of a producer sale, nor doesn't it need in connection with the area rate making.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.886" offset="17814967">Where a producer, and there'd been darn few of them have filed, Caroline Hunt Sands is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.892" offset="17842970">Incidentally, she only asked for a contract, she doesn't ask for 33 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.407" offset="17856972">She can't, under Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.989" offset="17871287">Alright, darn few of these people have filed and when they file, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.219" offset="17892289">The Commission sets them down for hearing on an individual company-cost basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="6027.669" offset="24214026">But whatever they try, it has got to related at some point to cost, maybe it's a replacement of gas cost, maybe it's a recognition if the average producers are going to spend so much as getting stuff out of the ground, he's got to pay for his leases and so fort.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.674" offset="24270033">But whatever it is, the individual must eventually have the right to say, "You faced me with a terrible alternative because I am getting by your own definition less than a just and reasonable rate, I'd like to show you that I'm losing my share."</text>
