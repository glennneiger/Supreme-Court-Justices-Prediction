            <text syncTime="1476.889" offset="6010964">Well, first, Your Honor, I would like to read from the record to settle once and for all this question of whether there are zone lines on the elementary school level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.901" offset="6070941">Now, on page 62 of the record, preceding this on page 61, I went into this matter with the Superintendent as to zone lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.778" offset="6118484">I first went back to 1960 before the plan took effect and asked him how the students were assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.682" offset="6150144">And then, we finally got to the end of it after several questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.182" offset="6168116">And he -- I asked him this, "And you still have separate lines which relate to the Negro schools and separate lines which would relate to the White elementary schools, is that right?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.674" offset="6218062">And he said, "Roughly, yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.155" offset="6227989">Now, prior to that on page 61 at the bottom -- near the bottom, I asked him, "Now, in the areas where the housing is mixed racially," that is the areas where Negroes and Whites live in the same area, "these lines would overlap so to speak, wouldn't they?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.997" offset="6303326">And then he said, "Well, formerly, the lines were drawn separately for White and Negro schools," and I said, "And how are they drawn now?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.060" offset="6331643">He said, "They're drawn on the basis of the pupil assignment law."</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.651" offset="6345958">And I said, "Do you mean by that the law of the plan," and he said, "The plan," top of page 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.789" offset="6374484">And then we went on and I said, "And you say the lines are drawn pursuant to that?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.115" offset="6395800">Answer, "The same lines that were in existence in 1960 aren't existence at the present time".</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.021" offset="6423489">"I see," and then I went on to the question and answer I read before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.837" offset="6442715">And Judge Reeves, in his dissenting opinion, points out that the District Court and the majority simply overlooked the record and he put this testimony in a footnote, I think it's Footnote 4, if I'm not mistaken, regarding the fact that there are zone lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.875" offset="6510843">And he's -- he points out in his dissenting opinion, this majority opinion represents a step backward for the Fifth Circuit because they had just said in Augustus and in Bush that you must do away with the dual school zone lines and he says he --</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.630" offset="6661935">And we complained of course to the Court of Appeals and pointed that out and Judge Reeves quoted and said, "You're just overlooking the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.050" offset="6699551">Now, as to the Negro high school situation, we put in the exhibit, which is plaintiff's Exhibit 7, which came up here in its original form which has every elementary school and beside the names of the elementary schools, I put an end for those schools which are Negro elementary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.789" offset="6786487">The Superintendent agreed those were right in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.781" offset="6802474">Then the last page of the record contains the high schools in Atlanta beginning with Archer, Bass and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.497" offset="6837373">And the check marks on that exhibit are the Negro high schools and it shows five Negro high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.950" offset="6871124">Now, as he said, they have built one since that and that's Harper, so that's six Negro high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.553" offset="6893589">Then they have one Negro vocational school which is Karp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.498" offset="6909367">Now, that's in the record as to the number of Negro schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.155" offset="6927966">Now, the problem here is, as you can see, is a case where the facts were always changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.247" offset="6964328">The District Court, we had one set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.486" offset="6973315">We had a plan with 12 -- 17 criteria and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.989" offset="6987316">As to the Court of Appeals, they had abandoned all the three or four of the criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.598" offset="7009782">So we had another situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.803" offset="7018559">In their brief, they said the sole criterion is proximity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.031" offset="7035486">On this argument for the first time, we hear its free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.369" offset="7052831">Now, there has never been published, as far as we know, any document by the School Board which says what the plan is going to be in September 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.134" offset="7103927">We have not seen any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.439" offset="7113122">And if the lawyers can't keep up with the changing facts and different plans in this case, you can imagine the situation of the parents at Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.387" offset="7152933">But what is the School Board's plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.587" offset="7161710">And that's why this Court must establish standards based on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.195" offset="7188146">So that for once and for all, we can have standards to guide the district courts with respect to what kind of desegregation is acceptable at this point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burke Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="2612.140" offset="10551881">Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to return to a comment that Mr. Justice Brennan made as Mr. Latimer was closing and that is as he understood it, if the plan worked the way that it is working as Mr. Latimer described it that the entire school system would be desegregated by 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.403" offset="10676955">As I understand this, even accepting the way Mr. Latimer states it, Mr. Justice Brennan, that is not correct, that it would still take until the fall of 1977 for the -- a school system, the school system as such to be desegregated and that is because of the effects and the remnants of the initial racial assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.801" offset="10782595">Now, as Mr. Latimer described it, it is easy for Negroes who live closer to a White school than to a Negro school to get out of the initial racial assignment which they are in because they went to that school the year before when the -- in the grade that was not desegregated at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.722" offset="10874232">But that's all he said that was -- that it was easy for the Negro student to get out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.470" offset="10897220">However, he does it, whatever the physical arrangement is, by going to the near White school or whatever else it does, he has to make a move which shifts him from a school that he has been going to because it was a Negro school to another school because he's closer to it and he meets whatever other requirements the School Board put on top.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.725" offset="10990320">Now, it seems to me that no matter how easy that transfer system is, that it does not answer the requirement of a desegregated or a nonracial school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.885" offset="11050924">For one thing, it -- it does not in itself answer the point that Mr. Justice Goldberg made earlier which is the question of a White school to which the Negro student is close, which is already fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.611" offset="11129814">In answer to that, the question of Mr. Justice Goldberg, Mr. Latimer said that a Negro student close by that went into that would displace White students already in and they would presumably have to go somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.072" offset="11187702">But that is not a school system working on a -- on a nonracial system necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.520" offset="11217481">It -- it has racial facts -- factors to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.671" offset="11242036">The -- and a related point to that is that it seems to me that in preserving Negro schools as such was -- which it does through this initial racial assignment, it is going to maintain systems of overcrowding, conditions of overcrowding, a Negro schools that a School Board normally were not for racial considerations would cure of itself by rezoning, by changing attendant systems or by whatever means they chose, they would -- it would at least be a situation that a School Board would normally look to and try to cure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.595" offset="11921742">And Judge Bell, at that time, said that the School Board had to eliminate all factors in dealing with transfers that made it more difficult for a Negro who had already in a school because he was a Negro to get out, then it would make it to -- for a White student to transfer from one school to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.070" offset="12019649">And if I can put it this way, Mr. Justice Brennan, the opinion of the Fifth Circuit in approving that is wrong then because they are talking in terms of transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.557" offset="12069595">They are talking about a school system which is perpetuated by -- in terms of initial racial assignments but in which they have made it easy, as easy as possible for Negro students who are still or put into school or go to a school because they went there last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.554" offset="12141589">And they went there last year because it was a Negro school, no matter where they came from, that's why they went to it, make it easy for them to get out rather than the School Board reorganizing the school system so that no student is in the school because he's a Negro in the first place.</text>
