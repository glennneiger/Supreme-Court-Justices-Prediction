            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.255" offset="128397">When we recessed a half a hour ago we had just reached the point of identifying in the large the two constitutional attacks on the statute, two bases for constitutional attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.036" offset="187538">And I would now like to turn in the first instance to the Fifth Amendment attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.391" offset="208959">And as we said, the question here is, is this fair, is it reasonable, is it a rational means to an end that Congress is free to pursue under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.629" offset="277922">Now it seems to me that this is fairly readily disposed of the end that Congress is pursing is the preservation of the national security by frustrating the purposes and objectives of a world movement which is dedicated to overthrowing our government.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.304" offset="368619">And as this Court quoting Madison in the 41st federal has said, protection against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.406" offset="420968">It is an avowed an essential object of the American Union, the power requisite for obtaining it must be effectually confided to the federal counsels.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.443" offset="469138">So we have an appropriate end, an end that Congress can constitutionally entertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.244" offset="500381">And we have a finding that Congress has made on the basis of evidence that travel is a necessary part of the apparatus, the integument of this world organization whose purposes it is seeking to frustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.548" offset="585540">So that it is then not irrational to seek to prevent that travel as a way of seeking to prevent the attainment of those unlawful objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.463" offset="4969200">Well I would only say Mr. Justice Goldberg that in the Briehl case itself, the Court said as to our then existing regulation, which you recall permitted the withdrawal of a passport not because of membership in the Communist Party but because the conduct abroad would be inimical to the interest of the United States and which took, only took Communist Party membership into account as appellants say would be a proper situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.975" offset="5103261">What the Court said about that is, and it said, “The only law which Congress has passed expressly curtailing the movement of Communists across our borders has not yet become effective.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.997" offset="5151326">That was this Section 6 that we're now talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.808" offset="5162611">It would therefore be strange to infer that pending the effectiveness of that law, the Secretary has been silently granted by Congress the larger, the more pervasive power to curtail in his discretion the free movement of citizens in order to satisfy himself about their beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.235" offset="5244322">Now I think it's possible in a sort of an abstract logical sense to say that all you're worried about is conduct abroad that's going to be dangerous to our security and therefore in order to prevent travel, you ought to have some showing that the conduct is likely to be dangerous to our security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.402" offset="5340975">And that has a very plausible and pleasing sound to it, and I don't deny that abstractly that sounds like a narrower regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.626" offset="5389876">But if you think of the problem of administering that kind of statute, if you think of the problem of appraising evidence to fathom an individual's future intentions, if you think of the problem of what this is, giving the person the opportunity to go abroad and there to do what he pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.024" offset="5479424">He may correctly have no and properly say that he has no intention of doing anything wrong, when he appears before the hearing, but when he gets over there, there may then be an opportunity to engage in the wrongful activity which he embraces, indeed that's happened and cases of that kind are cited, of misuse of passport after accepting stipulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.625" offset="5685896">We have relied on confidential evidence, because after all if you have a standard of that kind, the necessity or the desirability of seeming -- of relying on confidential evidence seems greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.555" offset="5745560">So most of these bills that are cited in the appellants' brief do provide that in certain cases the Secretary may rely on secret or confidential evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.137" offset="14627924">But I do want to reply to a question that the Chief Justice asked as to whether the state department has applied passport provision to rank and file members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.678" offset="14678079">Let's used at term instead of mere member of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.372" offset="14692812">And the answer to that Mr. Chief Justice is that the statute makes it difficult but not impossible for a rank and file member to apply for a passport, because by the very act of applying, he's subjecting himself to a possible five-year prison sentence, and this no academic business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.322" offset="14764701">The Department of Justice last Fall indicted a women, I don't know whether she is a mere member or rank and file member, or what kind of member she is, but indicted her out of down in San Francisco charged with just doing one thing for having applied for a passport while being a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.764" offset="14830425">And that I should think would be sufficient to discourage rank and file members from testing out the application of the act to themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="3761.285" offset="15148492">The State department did us a favor I would say, or did the organization a favor in permitting this case to brought in a civil from rather than requiring a criminal prosecution to try it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.593" offset="15197706">Now, as I understand Mr. Chayes, what he, in bottom, is saying is that it's necessary to deny passports to all members of the Communist Party as a class indiscriminately, because we have to forestall the possibility of their doing something illegal if they went abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.920" offset="15295091">Now, and it's too risky to wait until they do something illegal and then prosecute them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.059" offset="15319646">I'd like to say only that all democracy I think Mr. Justice Holmes who made the point long ago I can't remember the exact phrase, but all democracy is a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.065" offset="15355591">The presumption of innocence is very risky business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.727" offset="15370324">And the rule against the prior restraints on First Amendment -- on the exercise of First Amendment rights is a very risky business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.757" offset="15402402">You got to wait until something bad is done under our constitution before you can prosecute a man or punishing or deny -- or deprive him of his liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.293" offset="15448586">Now -- but even if we put that one aside, put aside the argument I made earlier on the question of preventive detention, which I think is very much in the foreground of this case, and talk only about the form of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.948" offset="15511176">Mr. Chayes is a legal advisor for the state department but I must say that he talks, when he argues to this Court, as a typical prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.004" offset="15551404">The typical prosecutor says, if we have to prove that this man from the beginning of ab initio, this man committed a crime, will never get a conviction, and therefore we need a presumption that was Tot case that Mr. Justice Black -- in which Mr. Justice Black wrote the opinion and that's been the cry the of prosecutor since the beginning of time, we need the help of a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.270" offset="15660492">Now, I don't think that the national security is so endangered that we've got to throw away the presumption of innocence and rely on these kind of presumptions that every person who joined the Communist Party, merely because of his membership, is a potential spy, saboteur, or whatnot in order to protect the national security of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.140" offset="15763937">Indeed I think in terms of the real source and base of our national security, it lies not in shortcut procedures of this kind but the real base of our national security that lies in the perseverance of our constitution and the democratic processors that have been traditional with us and I that I hope that we'll continue to observe.</text>
