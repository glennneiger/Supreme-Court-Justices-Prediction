            <text syncTime="1261.788" offset="5047066">It gets back to this question of previous restraint not being the full scope of the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.109" offset="5180395">And Dean Pound says it was that sort of thing that led the colonies as soon as they could make a frame of government for themselves into what these provisions with reference to the liberty of the press in their Bill of Rights, a criticism of a judge or justice of the peace in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.710" offset="5250821">Now then, came the Sedition Act, the federalist ruthless enforcement of its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.971" offset="5275794">And then this is something else so far as I know that has never been mentioned in that connection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.251" offset="5340996">It was passed in the House by a vote of 50 to 48 on the lone federalist vote of John Marsh who very nearly wrecked his political career by that statement because he went directly against this party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.718" offset="5394808">He was the only federalist in the Congress, which had a majority of federalists, which went along with the repeal of the sedition law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.512" offset="5430021">Now, in 1940, Attorney General Robert H. Jackson refused to institute a prosecution for criminal libel of a public official under the District of Columbia's Criminal Libel Act stating that that would constitute embarrassment not consistent with our support of the freedom of the press and it is therefore the Department of Justice policy that we do not institute that kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.985" offset="5567843">Actually, on statistics which we have cited in our brief, it is shown that the larger number of criminal libel actions recently instituted throughout the United States, have been for libel of public officials that is as Sedition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.567" offset="5646211">After all, this Court has held uniformly now in a number of leading cases that out of court criticism of judges may not be punished as contempt without trial by jury and in the absence of a clear and present danger of interference with the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.660" offset="5722593">We submit that you cannot change that rule in a criminal libel prosecution without a jury simply by calling it, labeling it criminal libel or sedition instead of contempt of court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.340" offset="5793332">Now, the question of malice is really the only other one whether this Court intends to substitute that rule for the clear and present danger rule, which I'm sure it did not in the New York Times case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.291" offset="5849130">And -- or whether perhaps it means to add that on to the requirements amongst the clear and present danger rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.251" offset="5884970">We submit that in any event there has not been a finding of malice as I stated a few moments ago within the meaning of that expression as used in the New York Times case that the prosecution in the case at bar violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments and that the opinion of the Supreme Court of Louisiana should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.911" offset="7131638">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.334" offset="7153267">I think that the law in this case is pretty well expressed in the Times-Sullivan decision which states that where defamatory remarks concerned a public official in his official conduct, that actual malice must be shown to sustain a conviction or recovery in a civil suit, and likewise to sustain a judgment of guilty as charged in a criminal statute.I have no argument with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.968" offset="7295791">And I certainly appreciate counsel's marvelous opportunity and presentation to try to bring this case under the time through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.934" offset="7339677">But as you said in the Times decision, that it was your duty to -- it's not limited to the elaboration of constitutional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.102" offset="7384398">We must also in proper cases review the evidence to make sure that these principles have been constitutionally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.827" offset="7411252">I'm very confident that this Court will do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.726" offset="7426821">And I know that when you do that, that you will find here, the District Attorney making malicious statements that attack the personal reputation of these judges which subjected them to hatred, ridicule, and contempt, and which destroyed their public confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.545" offset="7534132">Now, that is the charge that the state made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.806" offset="7555135">That may review our defamation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.151" offset="7568509">And I ask you to bear in mind that this is not a contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.966" offset="7583765">Contempt is defined as an entirely different matter in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.004" offset="7603931">Contempt can be constructed in the presence of the Court or it can be outside of the presence of the Court such as a newspaper public -- publishing an editorial about the conduct of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.774" offset="7651056">And I might say that Louisiana recognize this, the clear and present danger because in the case of Graham versus Jones which is cited in our supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.119" offset="7700376">The Supreme Court of Louisiana said that this editorial of the Times speaking succinctly have no effect on the decision of these judges and dismissed the contempt citation of the Times speaking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.572" offset="7746247">But we have no clear and present danger involved in this particular matter because there was no question about the obstruction of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.863" offset="9067416">If he had a remedy, he could have gone to the Supreme Court and ask the judicial, the administrator of the Supreme Court of Louisiana to investigate it.</text>
