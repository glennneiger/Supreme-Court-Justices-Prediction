            <label>Mr. J. Franklin Fort</label>
            <text syncTime="10.739" offset="146369">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.835" offset="166745">This case involves two questions arising under the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.149" offset="199973">The petitioner here chartered 10 ships during the years 1946 and 1947 under that Act, and the argument revolves around whether a statutory provision fixing the charter hire is paramount over a contractual provision which we claim differs from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.689" offset="310105">The statutes that are involved, Your Honors, are set forth in a foldout sheet to our brief, the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.640" offset="349915">We have set forth there that the relevant statutes, the provisions of the applicable regulations, the first form of charter that the Maritime Commission used, and in the last column, the form of charter which is in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.193" offset="432149">In substance, the Merchant Ship Sales Act was designed to dispose either by sale or charter of the large fleet of war-built merchant vessels resulting from World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.256" offset="508426">The statute provided for the fixing of a basic monthly or annual charter hire and for a -- the sharing of profits with the government arising out of the operation of the chartered vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.644" offset="585958">The first section in concern is Section 5 (b), which you will see up at the left-hand corner of the foldout sheet, which says, in substance that the charter hire, the fixed charter hire shall be in an amount not less than 15% of the statutory sales price of the vessels as fixed for sale under the 1946 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.484" offset="709360">The second section, Section 5 (c) states that the provisions of certain sections of the Merchant Marine Act 1936, including Section 709, shall be applicable to charters made under this section and 709, which is the principal statutory provision in question here is quoted at the bottom of that column.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.777" offset="826493">That says that every charter made by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of this Title shall provide whenever at the end of any calendar year, subsequent to the execution of such charter, the accumulative net voyage profit shall exceed 10%, and I'm giving you the substance now on the ca -- charter's capital necessarily employed, that the charter shall pay over to the Commission as additional charter hire, one-half of such cumulative net voyage profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.820" offset="978631">In the next column, you will find the regulations, the regulation relating to the fixed 15% hire, reiterates and summarizes the statute, the regulation relating to the profit-sharing hire, the 50-50 division of profits describes this as a mandatory provision in the charters and provides for one-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.893" offset="1090957">The third column is the original charter which the Maritime Commission used with the industry which provides for a one-half division of profits with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.451" offset="1141217">And in the last column, you will find the provision of the charter, Clause 13, at the bottom, of which we complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.561" offset="1185625">In substance, what happened was that the Maritime Commission took Section 709 (a) and rewrote it to include a sliding scale of additional charter hire up as high as 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.643" offset="1253961">And the first controversy here is whether they had the legal authority to charge the excess amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.009" offset="1287398">Now, the Ship Sales Act form of charter was adopted in September 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.985" offset="1327313">The Maritime Commission fixed the basic annual hire, and I'm using liberty vessels now for purposes of illustration because they were the type of this company charter, fixed a basic hire of $96,000 a year for those ships payable, irrespective of profits and losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.422" offset="1429086">That was about $14,000 more than the minimum that they could have fixed per annum under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.122" offset="1471822">They then proposed this sliding scale of additional charter hire for the charterers and the industry associations objected to it and after these objections were raised, the provisions of the charter were amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.868" offset="1550817">A further provision was added to Clause 13 which is not on the foldout sheet but which is at page 7 of our brief in a footnote stating that any payments of additional charter hire based on profits which were made under that clause would be tentative and preliminary until the final audit of the charterer's accountings for profits and losses and that the -- at the time of the final audit, an adjustment would be made and amounts refunded to the charterers as may be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.100" offset="1719777">Now, that clause has been the subject of some litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.899" offset="1739003">We've cited the cases in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.122" offset="1751855">It's been admitted that it was put in there to protect our position with respect to our dispute as to whether the charter provision calling for this sliding scale of additional charter hire conflicted with the statutory provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.724" offset="1846314">And I won't go into the details of -- of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.761" offset="1858435">I think the record is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.247" offset="1864391">The District judge in this case found that we have reserved our rights and that we have relied on -- on those rights in -- in holding -- holding back and raising the issue at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.231" offset="1912247">And there are a series of regulations and I will quote you -- we quote one on this foldout sheet, toward the bottom of the second column.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.828" offset="1954670">It says, “Referring to this additional charter hire, such payment shall be deemed to be preliminary and subject to adjustment that come -- upon the completion of audit by the Commission covering the period involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.470" offset="2005243">And neither the tender thereof by the charterer nor its acceptance by the Commission shall prejudice the rights of either under the applicable bareboat charter agreement or otherwise."</text>
            <text syncTime="494.553" offset="2081625">Now of course, the petitioners signed the form of charter subject to the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.512" offset="2113390">And after their accountings were in, there were some minor matters to be settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.959" offset="2135228">As a matter of fact, several disputes were settled within the framework of -- of the -- of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.816" offset="2158634">The remaining dispute was this question involving the sliding scale of additional charter hire and one other question which I'll come to later.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.323" offset="2196668">We have litigated this question in numerous courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.252" offset="2220387">There are nine decisions squarely in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.840" offset="2234702">They range from a decision which says that we are absolutely right and there shouldn't be any doubt about it to the decision of the court below which indicated that they thought the decision in our favor had been lost in a Forest of Pedagogy and --</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Franklin Fort</label>
            <text syncTime="551.155" offset="2307950">In a Forest of Pedagogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.359" offset="2324773">The decisions -- the divergence in the reasoning of the decisions seems to be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.270" offset="2360404">The Government has argued that Section 709 (a) which provides for the inclusion of this 50-50 profit-sharing clause really fixes a minimum that it is drafted for the benefit of the Government and that any amount in excess of 50% could be contracted for outside of the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.272" offset="2472417">Relying upon the first sentence of Section 5 (b) which says that the charter hire for any vessel chartered under the provisions of this section shall be fixed by the Commission as such -- at such rate as the Commission determines to be consistent with the policies of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.208" offset="2560188">And they stopped there.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.688" offset="2570115">But our argument is of course that the next word in that statute is “but”.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.427" offset="2597073">And there followed numerous restrictions on what decisions the Maritime Commission can make in respect to this charter hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.792" offset="2638555">The first one is that the rate shall not be less than 15% per annum unless four members of the Maritime Commission decide that it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.974" offset="2691218">The second restriction is the restriction imposed by Section 709 (a) which says that every charter shall contain a provision providing for an even division of profits with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.601" offset="2761749">Further, and we argue this that it's quite obvious from the legislative history as well as the plain language of Section 5 (b) itself, that they were not talking in that section about any discretion with respect to the fixing of profit-sharing.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.014" offset="2847431">They talked about a rate of charter hire fixed in advance, payable annually based upon the statutory sales price of the vessels being sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.991" offset="2907303">And that in our view does not authorize any profit-sharing arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.250" offset="2940322">Furthermore, the first part of that section, which speaks of charter high -- hire being fixed by the Commission as such rate as the Commission determines to be consistent with the policies of this Act, cannot be interpreted to permit a profit-sharing arrangement which was inconsistent with the next section of the Act which fixes a profit-sharing arrangement of 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.909" offset="3066964">And further, the legislative history indicates -- the legislative history of Section 5 (b), which we quote in our briefs indicates that Congress was consistently thinking of a -- of a fixed charter hire based on a percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.963" offset="3131225">Originally, the percentage proposed to Congress was 8.5% of the statutory sales price which was a figure derived from the 1936 Merchant Marine Act and it kept progressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.287" offset="3196531">The next draft of the legislation fixed a rate of 12.5% and the third proposal was of 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.589" offset="3233729">And when they put the 15% in there, the Congress considered that might be too high a rate and they therefore added the sentence at the end which would permit the 15% to be lowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.203" offset="3320142">Now the -- the Government as well as the court below took the position that the provisions of 709 (a) should be construed as a minimum profit-sharing arrangement on the theory that it was the purpose, a dominant purpose of the 1946 Ship Sales Act to sell vessels rather than to charter them.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.719" offset="3422229">But obviously, Congress intended that vessels should be chartered or they would not have put that authority in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.684" offset="3462144">And it is clear also from the legislative history that Congress expected the chartering program to aid in the rehabilitation of the post-war Merchant Marine as well as the sales provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.752" offset="3526405">There were a number of companies who -- none of the companies had ships available right after the war and the chartering would fill-in their needs for vessels while they were either reconverting vessels which had been converted to military use or while they were constructing new vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.255" offset="3612400">In the -- as I indicated before, Section 709 (a) comes out of the 1936 Merchant Marine Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.724" offset="3650226">In the case of that Act, there is no question but that the profit-sharing arrangement is a 50-50 minimum and maximum arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.130" offset="3707904">The legislative history is clear on that and we of course argue that there should be no distinction between the interpretation of the section in the 1946 Act and there is the interpretation of the section in the 1936 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.028" offset="3815528">I might say, Your Honors, under this bareboat form of charter which the Maritime Commission promulgated, that all the risk of laws was on the charterers.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.046" offset="3879581">The ship was turned over to them in a bareboat state.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.731" offset="3898284">They were to man the ships, to supply them, to insure them, to keep them in repair, and redeliver them to the Government at the end of the charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.501" offset="3945409">If they lost money, the loss was on them, but in the meantime, the Government would be receiving this 15% basic charter hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.766" offset="4022418">The second question which we have for -- before Your Honors is one that we refer to as the split accounting in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.433" offset="4081142">In the middle of 1947, the shipping market declined quite markedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.606" offset="4113847">The Maritime Commission and -- but before that, during the year 1947, there had been substantial profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.989" offset="4159300">The Maritime Commission became concerned that if there would be a turn in the market and they left the ships in the hands of the companies, that the high profit-sharing rates of 90% might be diluted by losses which occurred later in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.295" offset="4256580">So, in August of 1947 they sent telegrams to all of the charterers and said that they were terminating the charters on 15 days notice but that the charterers might continue the use of the vessels if they would agree that the profits earlier in the year might not be offset against any losses which they might sustain later in the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.045" offset="4383535">Now, the companies of course had developed their trade routes and were trying to get back in the business and this abrupt termination would've been quite serious to them because they had continuing charters which they had signed going on into the end of the year and into the next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.339" offset="4476740">So, they signed an addendum to the contract called the Foreign Trade Addendum, the principal provision of which was that for profit-sharing purposes the year 1947 would be divided into two parts as of September 1, 1947 and that the profits before that date would be accounted for separately from the profits or losses which they turned out to be after that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.529" offset="4621458">The -- there was no termination of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.309" offset="4636609">The ships were not redelivered to the Maritime Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.183" offset="4656149">The -- they simply amended this term and one or two other terms in minor respects but the principal term which -- to which we have -- to the -- the companies objected was this divided accounting term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.441" offset="4717171">Now the -- the effect of this particular requirement on this petitioner was that, after the charter was over, under the regulations of the Maritime Commission, it had suffered an overall loss of $50,000 on the charter and the Government took some $500,000 of profits for the period prior to September 1, plus, $700,000 of the basic charter hire which was paid monthly on the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.965" offset="4895222">So that the Government received about $1,200,000 from the charter and the company lost $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.758" offset="4938376">The court below, in respect to this issue -- well, to get back to -- to the complaint we have here, the Section 709 (a), to get back to that section, says that every charter made by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of this Title shall provide that whenever at the end of any calendar year subsequent to the execution of such charter, accumulative net voyage profit is so much, then the profit shall be shared 50-50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.818" offset="5074631">Our contention is that that section not only fixes a 50-50 profit-sharing division with the companies but that it requires that accounting be made on a calendar year basis under the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.425" offset="5161044">And that it was a violation of this section as well to require the companies to agree on some other accounting basis rather than the calendar year, in other words, to split the year in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.588" offset="5229693">The court below and the Government, both point out that -- take the position that 709 (a), that's mandatory, as we say, provision of the statute merely fixed minimum terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.120" offset="5307852">And that any terms, although in conflict with this section which were more beneficial to the Government could be provided for by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.137" offset="5351946">We say the law is otherwise that this is a mandatory section and they could not change our basis of accounting simply for the purpose of attempting to get more additional charter hire out of the companies than the statute required.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.623" offset="5753814">Now, if Your Honors please, while this case deals with charters entered into under the Ship Sales Act of 1946, I think that the decision of this Court may have an impact on the administration of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 which is of course the Act under which the Maritime Commission subsidizes the shipping industry at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.338" offset="5868753">There are other sections of the -- there are sections of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, such as Section 606 (5), which is on page 52 of our brief which were of course passed at the same time that Section 709 was passed, where there is a provision that every contract entered into under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 shall provide for a 50-50 division of profits with the companies arising under the subsidy agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.344" offset="6020786">There are many other provisions of that Act which speak in mandatory terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.724" offset="6042311">And if this Court holds that some general grant of authority, either in the 1936 Act or, in this case, in the 1946 Act, permits the Maritime Commission to modify these mandatory provisions on the theory that they fix minimum requirements, then it will undermine the administration of the 1936 Act and -- and permit in effect, the government agency involved here to -- to rewrite in our view the mandatory provision set down by Congress after considerable debate and discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.671" offset="6290056">Going through one other point, Your Honors, the -- the decisions which have been against us have implied that the companies were making tremendous profits out of these charters if they could use them in the world, in the open market that the market was high and for that reason they seem to feel if there's some justification for -- in our view, stretching the statute to permit the sliding scale, although it speaks in terms of 50-50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.966" offset="6439267">We don't agree that that argument is material but I would like to say a word about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.410" offset="6469047">In the first place, after World War II, the United States really had a monopoly of vessels which were available for charter or sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.579" offset="6513664">There were some 4,000 vessels that were built during the war, 20 million tons of shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.360" offset="6540831">In handling the chartering program, the Maritime Commission was careful to specify in the charters and their regulations that the ships could only be used on certain routes that they could charge only certain rates to the shippers and that in some cases the sub-charters were negotiated with the -- with the shippers on the basis of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.657" offset="6673951">In this way, the Commission itself confined the profits of the industry and you will find that not all of the companies had profits in excess of -- of the -- that were subject to recapturing excess of the 50% rate and a great many of them had no claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.300" offset="6764544">It's only the ones that have come to court that involved the payment of this additional charter hire at the higher rates of the sliding scale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.757" offset="6814386">So that, we say that the profits -- the Maritime Commission attempted and accomplished a squeezing out of the profit element in these charters when they made the charters, and that any argument that's based on exorbitant value or excessive profits is not material in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.102" offset="6915741">And further, one last point, obviously the -- in the case of all of the companies, if they made -- even at the 50% rate, made profits, their share of the profits was of course subject to income tax which again would have the impact of -- of leveling off the profit factor in these charters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.612" offset="8449860">The courts have held -- the Fourth Circuit has held that accumulative net voyage profits mean the combining of profits from year to year over the entire period of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.401" offset="8500955">And if the Maritime Commission attempted to prevent that accumulation from year to year, that it would be contrary to that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.247" offset="8552364">And that is precisely what happened and the Commission had a regulation which said that you could carry forward losses from one calendar year to offset profits in the next calendar year but that you could not carry forward profits in one calendar year to offset losses in a subsequent calendar year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.181" offset="8640136">And the Fourth Circuit has held that that regulation was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.928" offset="8659048">That this statute means that you take the charter in its entirety from beginning to end and you accumulate the results of voyages in every given year and that you also, in computing the profits, offset profits and losses which occur from year to year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.947" offset="9091114">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.631" offset="9101876">I want to emphasize at the outset what the shipping lines are seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.475" offset="9117236">In this litigation, the related litigation, is a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.646" offset="9129984">It's a windfall of millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.587" offset="9141687">They were offered charters at a very low fixed rate on condition that they agreed to pay to the Government a high percentage of any excessive profits, specifically 50% of its profits in excess of 10% return, 50% of the first $100 a day per ship, 75% of the next $200 a day per ship, and if there were profits in excess, even of $300 a day, 90% of those excessive profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.921" offset="9283062">The shipping lines were not entitled to be given charters or to be given charters on more favorable terms, and they were in no way required to accept the charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.876" offset="9330918">They chose to do so presumably because they though the terms were advantageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.850" offset="9354742">And even now, they do not claim that the total hire paid under the charters was greater than the fair value of the ships and in point of fact, it was considerably less than the world market rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.240" offset="9412315">Now having gotten the benefit of their contracts, they asked the court to revise the bargain to give them even more favorable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.716" offset="9454216">They do that on the ground allegedly that a part of the consideration provided for was provided for in a form forbidden by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.070" offset="9495698">And the remedy they asked is that the court excise from the contract that additional part of the consideration but otherwise to enforce the contract despite the failure of consideration, according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.253" offset="9552436">Now specifically, they agreed to pay a fix rate equal to 15% of the statutory sales price, plus up to 90% of excessive profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.819" offset="9598621">What they asked the court to do is to give them the benefit of the contract, agreed to by no one, at a rate equal to the same low fixed rate plus only 50% of the excessive profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.411" offset="9645014">Now, the result obviously have no relationship to the contract that was agreed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.820" offset="9666644">But more than that, I want to show it would have no relationship to any contract that the Commission would ever have agreed to had it been told in 1946 that it could not use this form of contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.734" offset="9718262">Now, I think that's self-evident simply in the relationship of the low fixed hire and the high percentage of profit recovery, but we have more than that in this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2420.078" offset="9783672">Oh, the -- they did provide it in the original contract issued under the authority of the Ship Sales Act of 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.866" offset="9822856">Some of the vessels had been leased, I would develop this history, had been leased under -- actually, be -- when the Ship Sales Act was passed in 1946, the Commission established a policy committee, a special policy committee, charter committee to advise it on the terms on which it should charter -- charter vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.625" offset="9913866">Now in the interim, before the -- the 1946 Act was implemented, the War Shipping Administration, under its preexisting emergency war time powers, had chartered vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.819" offset="9962663">Now, the War Shipping Administration had done so at a rate equal to 15% of the statutory sales price, basically the same fixed rate that these contracts provide for, plus only 50% of the excess profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.407" offset="10025044">Now, the policy committee that was appointed, with high-level officials of the Maritime Commission, immediately and unanimously agreed that those rates were entirely too low, that they permitted exorbitant profits and if they were continued, it would undermine the whole purpose of the Act, namely to sell ships not -- not to charter ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.689" offset="10110098">The purpose was to get the Government out of the shipping business and to sell ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.076" offset="10127653">Chartering was tolerated only as a necessary interim measure to satisfy the world's needs for shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.927" offset="10155029">There were not sufficient tonnage available and until the privately owned fleet was reestablished, it was necessary to allow the Commission to charter vessels for use during the interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.711" offset="10210200">And, the Commission -- the committee unanimously agreed that the existing rates charged by the War Shipping Administration would frustrate that policy and must be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.068" offset="10251682">There was no question whether they should be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.758" offset="10262444">The only question was how.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.281" offset="10272475">The committee thought it preferable not to increase the fixed charge but rather to increase the percentage of profits to be recaptured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.225" offset="10324302">It argued that while shipping rates generally were very high, there were some trades which were less remunerative and -- and in those, a high fixed charge could not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.627" offset="10373831">And it was impracticable to negotiate different terms for each chartered, depending upon the trade the ship was going to be used in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.128" offset="10407894">And much more convenient to provide the increase in the form of profit-sharing which would provide an automatic adjustment of the total hire to the profitability of the particular trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.652" offset="10457945">In addition they argued that a decline of shipping rates could be anticipated as the immediate post-war demand slackened and as other capacity became available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.670" offset="10502040">And that a flexible rate, i.e. the greater profit-sharing rate, would provide the needed flexibility and adoptability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.094" offset="10535790">Now one member -- one member of the committee disagreed with that recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.565" offset="10557628">He argued that the terms of the Act consistent with the policy of discouraging chartering and encouraging purchase required that they set a fixed rate more nearly equal to the world's shipping rate, the world charter rate for the prevailing market rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.292" offset="10628577">And he urged that they more than double the fixed rate, 15%, I think up to about 34% which was still below -- at least below the world rate, at least as he computed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.203" offset="10688136">Now, the Commission itself initially -- initially directed the -- after the -- there were actually two co -- two study committees and after the first one reported, the Commission initially directed it -- they had recommended not raising the fixed rate but increasing the profit-sharing rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.424" offset="10761070">And the Commission initially rejected that proposal and told them to go back and come forth with a proposal to increase the fixed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.380" offset="10796910">Actually, they reconstituted the -- the advisory committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.187" offset="10812165">But the new committee persisted in its view that a -- it's a much preferable way to increase rates to increase the rate of profit-sharing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.363" offset="10848841">And ultimately the Commission agreed with the advisory committee and adopted -- kept the rates, the fixed rates at the rate charged by -- basically the same rate charged by the War Shipping Administration but increased the rate of profit-sharing and finally settled on the sliding scale formula, a 50% at the first $100, 75% of the next $200, and 90% of any excess over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.505" offset="10961377">Now, all this is unique -- uniquely documented in this record which contains not only the reports of the two committees and the minutes of the Commission's meetings, but a very long detailed affidavit by a member of one of the committees on the evolution of the chartering policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.750" offset="11042356">Now here, the shipping lines asked the Court to excise from the contract the increase in the profit-sharing rate but otherwise, to enforce the contract according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.823" offset="11106617">In effect, they claimed the right to retain the use -- the benefit of the use of the ships but to pay for them only 15% of the statutory price plus only 50% of the excessive profits, precisely the rates that the Commission and the committee were in unanimous agreement permitted exorbitant profits and would wholly undermine the purposes of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.995" offset="11811401">I haven't -- I haven't gotten to the question of specific statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.612" offset="11825821">I will deal with the effect of the incorporation of Section 709 and show that that does not limit their basic authority, contracting authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.676" offset="11866049">But, I've just been showing the evolution of the administrative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.335" offset="11884753">My point really has been simply that never would the Commission have agreed to the contract that the shipping lines now seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.905" offset="11931042">Had the Commission been told in 1946 that it could not increase the profit-sharing rate, it would have and that's demonstrable from the record, it would have instead increased the fixed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.731" offset="11982346">My point is that they are seeking to have the court throw out the increase in the profit-sharing rate but allow them to keep the low fixed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.430" offset="12017142">And it is that, I say, that would produce solely a windfall to the shipping companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.054" offset="12043577">Now, they're asserting no right of their own to receive a contract on those terms, those specific terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.533" offset="12065520">They say simply that the addition, the form of the additional consideration is unauthorized and to prevent frustrating the intent of Congress, the Commission should not be allowed to collect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.798" offset="12114526">But they say, they should be able to keep the contract and all -- all the benefits of the contract and pay only the reduced rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.104" offset="12139813">The fact that giving them the ships at such bargain basement terms would even more flagrantly frustrate the intent of Congress seems to be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.897" offset="12174921">Now in fact -- of course that would not be the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.754" offset="12186415">Even if it were true -- even if it were true that the Commission did not have the authority to bargain for additional profit-sharing terms the result would be that the whole contract would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.391" offset="12236988">The low fixed rate and the high profit-sharing rate are parts of a single system of compensation and if one falls, the other falls, wouldn't -- then the whole contract must fall for the failure of the bargain for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.685" offset="12290069">The parties would then be remanded to the law of restitution to adjust their rights and the shipping lines, having had the use of the vessels, would be obligated to pay quantum valebant, the fair value of that use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.485" offset="12341269">And as it so happens in this case, the fact is that the fair value of that use exceeds the total hire payable under the contract, or at least the Government would undertake so to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.911" offset="12391006">The result would be that they would have to pay us more, unless the contract was effective at least to limit their liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.468" offset="12429249">As -- secondly before I -- I get to the details of the attack on statutory authority, there's another answer and that is having accepted the contract and accepted the benefits under it, the shipping lines are estopped and have no standing to challenge the validity of the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.537" offset="12509497">I think that is particularly true of a contract which was made not for the benefit of the charterers but for the convenience of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.199" offset="12552129">There's nothing in the Act that suggest any purpose to benefit charterers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.523" offset="12565504">The purpose of the Act was to sell ships and not to charter them, and chartering was permitted only as an interim measure to satisfy the need for ships in the transitional period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.782" offset="12618480">The purpose was to foster and maintain a domestic fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.671" offset="12634049">It is true, but a privately owned domestic fleet and not a chartered fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.515" offset="12661426">Now, that being so, the -- that the purpose of the chartering was simply to -- to get the ships afloat to serve the world's needs, not to benefit the charterers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.884" offset="12698937">The dealings between the Commission and the shipping lines were simply an arm's length business transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.803" offset="12722552">The only concern of the Commission was to set the rates low enough that there would be people willing to take the ships.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.975" offset="13579264">Now -- yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.770" offset="13590444">The -- when the industry got the idea that they had a claim and started to per -- process it generally, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.428" offset="13625135">Here, the first time they raised it was in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.287" offset="13640495">Now, I'd like to say that the simplest answer to this case is not estoppel or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.944" offset="13663169">It's the grounds that Judge Aldrich decided the case on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.109" offset="13675813">And that is that even passing all those questions, passing any deference to administrative expertise, there's not the slightest substance to the challenge to the Commission's authority to bargain as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.274" offset="13724505">The Act -- the basic chartering power is granted by Section 5 (a) and (b) of the Act which are at the Government's brief at page 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.002" offset="13787408">Section 5 (a) provides that the Commission may in its discretion charter vessels if in its opinion the chartering would be consistent with the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.074" offset="13855640">Now the policies of the Act as suggested by the title, Ship Sales Act, and in fact the declaration of policy in Section 2 of the Act says that it is declared to be the policy of this Act to foster the development, encouragement -- encourage the maintenance of an efficient and adequate American-owned merchant marine, as it further defined as a merchant marine owned and operated under the United States flag by citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.965" offset="13971205">The committee reports likewise emphasized this purpose to sell ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.775" offset="13994506">The objective of the measure is of course to transfer the Government owned tonnage to private ownership and later in as much as the policy of the measure is to put as many war-built vessels as possible into private ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.850" offset="14050722">The Commission is directed not to approve applications to charter unless chartering is consistent with the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.075" offset="14083636">It's also shown by the Act in the statutory requirement that the Commission prefer applications to buy or applications to charter and by the very stringent time limitations imposed upon the Commission's chartering authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.211" offset="14136195">This chartering authority was initially, although it was later extended, to expire on December 31, 1947, about one year-and-three-quarters after the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.564" offset="14181648">This is strictly an interim measure to utilize the ships until the privately owned tonnage had been sufficiently augmented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.811" offset="14226578">The -- now, as to the terms on which ships will be -- were to be chartered, that is governed by -- initially by Section 5 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.201" offset="14272136">Insofar as it's relevant here, that provides that the charter hire for any vessel, chartered under the provisions of this section, shall be fixed by the Commission at such rate as the Commission determines to be consistent with the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.536" offset="14341517">Now, at that point, just up to that point, the chartering terms were left entirely to the Commission subject only to the guideline that it was to encourage ship sales and not to encourage chartering as such, but charter only to the extent necessary to take up the slack until the privately owned fleet was -- was rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.156" offset="14447992">Now, if that provision stood alone, if that were all there was in the Act, I don't see how there can be any doubt that the Commission, if it thought it the best way to get the necessary ships into operation and yet prevent excessive profits, could have charged a fixed rate plus any percentage of excessive profits it deemed appropriate and can get the charterers to agree to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.494" offset="14545377">That is that this charter would be wholly authorized, there can be no doubt about it, if this is all the Act contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.049" offset="14575574">I would like to point out also that there would be no doubt that the Commission was authorized to make charters that contained no profit-sharing provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.970" offset="14615280">That -- that's another implication of 5 (a) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.070" offset="14623640">It didn't have to under -- so far as they're concerned, have any profit-sharing provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.686" offset="14650075">So the question is -- the only question is the effect of Section 5 (c) in its incorporation by reference of Section 709 of the 1936 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.817" offset="14694588">5 (c) says that the provisions of, among others, Section 709 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 shall be applicable to charters made under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.658" offset="14733981">709 is in our brief at page 48 and 49, and it says that every charter made by the Commission shall provide that whenever the voyage profits exceed 10% return on the capital necessarily employed the charterer shall pay over to the Commission as additional charter hire one-half of such cumulative net voyage profits in excess of 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.054" offset="14835545">Now, we agree that the petitioner is quite right that that is a mandatory provision, and he's quite right that there's a limitation on the Commission's chartering power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.059" offset="14883610">As I've said, so far as 5 (b) was concerned, the Commission didn't have to include any profit-sharing provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.994" offset="14911300">Section 709 (a) takes away that freedom and provides that the Commission, however unwise it may think it is, however much the industry resist it, however inconsistent the Commission may think it is with the statute or with the overall policies, the Commission must include a 50% profit-sharing provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.867" offset="15006804">If it failed to do so, it actually would be unauthorized and the Government could collect the 50% anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.697" offset="15026134">It is a mandatory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.648" offset="15041912">Now, the answer however, that this got nothing to do with the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.011" offset="15063437">This contract did include a provision requiring the charterer to pay to the United States 50% of excessive profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.490" offset="15097292">The Commission went beyond what Congress required and in fact required the charterers to pay up to 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.493" offset="15129370">It didn't flout the will of Congress, it want Congress one better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.078" offset="15143685">Congress said you must require them to repay 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.861" offset="15158836">We require them to pay up to 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.839" offset="15170748">Now, the argument the petitioners make cannot simply be that this is a mandatory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.173" offset="15200110">That doesn't answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.648" offset="15205961">The argument must rather be one about the collateral implications of Section 709.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.375" offset="15232920">As I understand it, it's essentially in occupation of the field theory that Congress in directing that they must include a 50% provision, must have intended to forbid the Commission to bargain for any greater percentage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3827.176" offset="15412120">It makes perfect sense for Congress to insist on a 50% provision and not leave it to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.520" offset="15437406">That they thereby assure that the Commission does inadvertently or otherwise set too low rates, at least 50% will be recaptured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.856" offset="15466768">But it makes no sense to leave the Commission free to set all the other terms of the contract, the fixed rates and the other kind of rate, but single out profit-sharing provisions and forbid the Commission to bargain for better terms in terms of profit-sharing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.273" offset="15532492">The -- that is -- the pur -- there was not -- as I say, there's nothing in the Act but just the purpose to benefit charterers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.113" offset="15575855">Why would Congress say that however exorbitant profits may be, even if they exceed $300 a day, you must allow, you must allow the shipping lines to keep half of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.538" offset="15625488">You cannot bargain for a higher percentage of the profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.607" offset="15641788">Now, in mandatory direction that you include 50%, however much the industry may resist it, to require that you have a 50% provision, on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.191" offset="15680136">On the other hand, a provision that you may not bargain for more than that would serve two totally separate disparate, and I think inconsistent purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.691" offset="15722141">And I don't see how a direc -- the direction to include the one contains in any way the implication that you may not add on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.732" offset="15758294">There is just simply no inconsistency, no basis for contrary implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.653" offset="15782013">Now, by way of analogy, Mr. Fort has told you there are other provisions of the Act that might be affected by his line of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.310" offset="15816600">I would like to point some, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.332" offset="15828720">Another provision of the 1936 Act that was incorporated in precisely the same fashion in the 1946 Act provides, "Every charter shall provide a mandatory provision that the charterer shall at its own expense keep the chartered vessel in good state of repair and in efficient operating condition."</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.364" offset="15912835">Does that mean the Commission may not bargain for the charterer to make capital improvements rather than repairs?</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.161" offset="15940002">The answer is, of course, it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.968" offset="15947212">Perhaps more germane, it also provides, "Every charter shall provide a mandatory provision that, whenever the President shall proclaim that the security of the National Defense makes it advisable, the Commission may terminate the charter."</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.162" offset="16008025">Does that provision occupy the field of termination clauses?</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.210" offset="16032162">Would it make -- would've make invalid a clause authorizing termination by either party, say, on 15-day's notice at any time?</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.422" offset="16069047">Apparently not even the shipping lines are willing to go quite that far for these charters do contain a 15-day termination clause, not limited to the President's making a determination about National Defense, they can just terminate any time on 15-day's notice and the validity of that clause would be germane to their second argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.590" offset="16145742">But it -- and none of this litigation for all of the -- what seem to be extreme arguments that could've been made, no one has ever challenged the validity of the 15-day termination clause on the grounds that the statute requires a clause saying only that the President may determine the interest of National Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.440" offset="16217109">Now, the point is the statutory requirement, you include one provision for the benefit of the Government, carries with it no implication at all that the contracting agency may not bargain for better terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="5517.482" offset="22173341">There was added to the clause a provision that says that the charterer agrees to make preliminary payments on account of additional charter hire at basically any time during the year on demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.597" offset="22221720">Now, that means that he has had a voyage and has made profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.880" offset="22242931">The clause doesn't require him to account for those until the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.330" offset="22256724">The Government may however, by this new provision, require him tentatively to give us our share of those profits and if he has losses later during the year, we will then, on the later accounting, adjust for that and pay it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.222" offset="22312312">So, this is a provision for tentative payments during the life of the contract and it provides that no payments of this sort will prejudice anybody's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.284" offset="22348466">Of course they don't prejudice anybody's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.832" offset="22362676">It's just a payment on account and then at the end, you towed up the profit and loss and who is entitled to what share.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.405" offset="22392978">Now, I have only a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.510" offset="22397367">I want to deal very briefly with the second question on this split-year accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.037" offset="22419519">In December of 1947, December 1947, the shipping industry which have previously been very profitable, the immediate post-war demand and the shortage of ships had produced very great profits and most of the charterers had large profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.868" offset="22474794">By 1947, the demand had slackened and the fleet had been increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.354" offset="22488795">There was excess tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.070" offset="22495692">Many complaints were made to the Commission about the excessive number of chartered vessels afloat and the committees of Congress complained about it and wanted the Commission to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.072" offset="22539682">They were undercutting the privately owned fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5612.262" offset="22552430">And, after all, the purpose of that was to move the privately owned fleet and the charterers were out undercutting the privately owned fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.138" offset="22575940">It was reported that they were operating at losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.638" offset="22589942">Now, since they had the right to terminate the contract on 15-day's notice, it may be wondered why they continued to operate at losses undercutting other people since they could always turn the ship back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.640" offset="22637902">But the fact is that there was an unintended -- this is an unintended effect of the progressive rate of profit-sharing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.501" offset="22673324">Now, the first profit which was 10% of return, which -- by the way, for convenience, I could reduce that 10% return to a fixed amount a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.843" offset="22710732">It works out to be basically a fixed amount a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.864" offset="22718777">Let's say its $20 a day, represents the 10% return.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.898" offset="22734973">So, the structure of the contract was the first $20 the charterer kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.765" offset="22754408">The next $100 he split 50-50 with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.759" offset="22766425">The next $200 he split 75 to the Government, 25 to the charterer, and anything over that was 90% to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.382" offset="22800906">Now, it was on a per day accounting basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.805" offset="22810624">Now, the more days -- if he had -- he had profits in the beginning of the year that were in the 90% bracket, the more days that he had stay -- he was afloat, he could use in the accounting, with making no additional profits, he could reduce -- he could take the 90% money and put it down in a lower bracket so that it paid a charterer who had beginning of the year profits to continue to operate even if necessary at a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.301" offset="22924622">He could not afford to turn the ship back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5707.845" offset="22934758">I -- I can demonstrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.243" offset="22976345">I had an example some place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.165" offset="22984077">Here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.692" offset="22994108">If he had $640 profits in one day, just take a very simplified case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5727.863" offset="23014797">One day, you have $640 profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.372" offset="23028903">The charterer would keep only $152 of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.051" offset="23043532">Most of it, $320 of it, will be the 90% bracket.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.118" offset="23055862">He could keep only $152.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.745" offset="23066311">If he could spread that same profit over two days, he would keep $240 of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.215" offset="23100270">So -- and, in fact, on the second day, so long as he didn't suffer a loss after $340, he was still ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.543" offset="23145514">So, the fact of this progressive rate structure, I think, unanticipated, as it turns out in 50 -- 1947, was that charterers were continuing to operate at a loss with the pressure of the -- beginning of the year profits forcing them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.408" offset="23213014">They made money by operating in a loss, which is at -- not what Congress wanted assuredly to have the charterers out undercutting the private fleet and carrying trade at a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5790.487" offset="23265364">Now, it was to force charterers to turn in their ships if they didn't have profitable use of them, that the Commission terminated the existing contracts and require the charterers, if they want to keep the ships, to agree to an addendum requiring them to account separately from thereon so that anybody who didn't foresee, who was engaging in loss traffic, couldn't afford to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.585" offset="23385736">It didn't pay him any longer to continue to engage in loss traffic and he would turn it in, and it was effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="6550.376" offset="26304867">And they did not raise it because the vessels were operating under sub-charters to shippers and government agencies which said that if the 15% rate were raised, then those agencies and shippers would pay a higher rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6569.164" offset="26379995">And the impact of all of that would have fallen on the Government of the addi -- raise in 15%.</text>

            <text syncTime="6610.330" offset="26544671">And some of the charters or sub-charters were negotiated on a cost-plus basis which of course took the profit out as well.</text>
