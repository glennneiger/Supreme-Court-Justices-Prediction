            <text syncTime="75.680" offset="406131">Two taxpayers by the name of Bromley were having tax problems with the Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.551" offset="433612">As a result of certain negotiations and actions, deficiency assessments in the sum of several million dollars had been issued by the Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.643" offset="469974">Ultimately, these assessments ended up in four cases to be adjudicated in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.413" offset="497037">At or about the time these cases were pending in the Tax Court, the firm in California Los Angeles retained the Washington firm to assist them in the defense of these tax cases and for any possible criminal litigation, if that ever arouse out of the so called tax delinquencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.196" offset="720123">Yes sir but not to the Tax Court, because those cases had been tried, but it is relevant because the commissioner has stated he is going ahead with these subpoenas anyway because there is a pending criminal investigation open in these cases, that's why it is not moot Your Honor, this is the dangerous aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.243" offset="792325">Now, here is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.547" offset="805595">The taxpayers endeavored to work out a settlement with the representatives of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.893" offset="834957">Tentative arrangements were made under which Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell, a vast accounting firm with offices throughout the world and throughout the United States were retained by Trammell, Rand, and Nathan, and by Reisman to aid them in preparing the defenses to the tax cases at any possible criminal implications that might be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.236" offset="928266">Discussions were entered into with the bureau and it was tentatively agreed that the various documents and papers which Trammell, Rand, and Reisman firm returned over to Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell for accounting purposes would be a sample, worksheets would be prepared and a certain disclosure would be made for settlement purposes with the bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.902" offset="1030980">Only assurance that there was no criminal investigation pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.385" offset="1048952">Negotiations to this end went on and at a late conference just before Counsel were about to turn over their work products to the bureau, the bureau then notified that there was an open criminal case after the so called bailment had been made between Counsel and their accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.813" offset="1130663">You must always bear in mind Your Honor that these accountants never worked for the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.128" offset="1151875">They were retained by counsel just as they retained anyone else to work in their office, such a law clerk, a bookkeeper, or any other person and the arrangement which is alleged in the compliant is that it was agreed that every piece of paper that went to Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell was to be isolated in a file and designated as the property of the plaintiff attorneys and not the property of the accountants.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.119" offset="1351868">I would like to get this factual background clear, so Your Honors will know about what we are discussing today.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.876" offset="1382902">When this conference in the bureau indicated to counsel for the Bromley's that there was a possible criminal investigation, Bromley himself went with his counsel to the bureau and then the bureau told him that that they wanted these papers, but that they were going to use them against him possibly in the civil and possibly in the criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.619" offset="1477883">And based on that situation Mr. Bromley stood on his Constitutional rights and refused to deliver the papers to the bureau of taking the ground that that would be violation of his rights against self incrimination when they were threatening criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.604" offset="1541831">He is perfectly willing to have them, have the papers that all they wanted them for was to use to settle the tax cases which were pending in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.218" offset="1580283">So he had refused to waive his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.514" offset="1593448">The tax cases were then set down for trial and were pinned all four of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.854" offset="1614764">At or about that time, the respondent Caplin issued on the 7604 a series of subpoenas addressed to Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell which are partnership by the way and not a corporation in their New York, Chicago and Los Angeles offices, asking for a whole, all of the papers which counsel had turned over to their accountants for use in defending the tax cases and for use in protecting them against criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.329" offset="1732733">Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell advised the, being a firm with vast operations didn't want to risk contempt because what we face under these subpoenas if you don't comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.875" offset="1782888">They said they were going to comply and were going to turn our papers over to the bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.518" offset="1809429">That left us but one recourse which we promptly took.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.359" offset="1824789">We went to the jurisdiction were the commissioner was located and where there was also an office of Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell in Washington DC.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.697" offset="1858121">We filed a civil action against the commissioner to join the enforcement of these subpoenas and we alleged that these subpoenas were not being used for the limited purposes set forth in 7602 and 4, which is for the purpose basically of determining the correctness of a tax repayment, not for prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.657" offset="1945997">And we further allege that these were the work products of counsel, they belong to counsel, they did not belong to Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell and this was an unConstitutional search and seizure contrary to the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.916" offset="2015065">There was no answer ever filed controverting the allegations of unConstitutional acts and the allegations of exceeding his statutory authority under these very limited statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.394" offset="2056965">That was never denied and of course hasn't been denied to this attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.973" offset="2079222">The complaint where the motion was sworn to, a motion for a temporary restraining order, and a preliminary injunction, were filed with a supporting affidavit of Mr. Nathan, which supported these allegations of the complaint, pointing out there would be a turning over of these papers which of course would destroy the trail preparation of the parties by the voluntary act of Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.842" offset="2170755">The matter came on for ex parte hearing before Judge Curran in our District Court he granted, yes sir --</text>

            <text syncTime="585.943" offset="2447130">The essence of the complaint is that the summons called for the production of privilege matter including the work product of the counsel and were not issued for the purpose of assessing taxes or of ascertaining the correctness of any return, but to obtain evidence for use in pending tax cases or to prosecute taxpayers criminally.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.347" offset="2528737">The defendants, reading now from 158 Your Honors of the record, the second sentence in that top paragraph, the defendants Harney and MacClure as representatives of the accounting firm answered, admitting the essential allegations of the complaint and joined in its prayers for relief which included a prayer that some of it be quashed.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.068" offset="2619643">We have always read this answer and the court below has always read it as an admission of all the material facts in the complaint, and the case has been argued on that basis, and of course that supplies all the parties involved in this litigation and places them before the jurisdiction of the district court assuming our position that the plaintiffs as petitioners, as counsel for the taxpayers got to assert their Constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.732" offset="3426304">I just bring that up because this came up only in the Court of Appeals, this question of the lack of consent to sue the United States in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.383" offset="3468936">The motion to dismiss was heard by another judge. There was no answer, or any affidavits contraverting these factual allegations which I have detailed to Your Honors which were covered by the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.861" offset="3518777">The case was heard on motion before Judge Heart.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.326" offset="3536645">Now Judge Heart didn't agree with this any theory that the court didn't have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.384" offset="3568933">As he ruled at Page 141, where there is an allegation and a complaint of unConstitutional action, which this complaint alleged, he is going off on another point Your Honor can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.181" offset="3628074">Judge Heart said this, “On the other hand of course the Federal Court always has jurisdiction to restrain an unConstitutional exercise of power,” that is the position which he took, but he took the position which I submit Your Honors is wholly unsupported by the record because he found contrary to the sworn allegations of the complaint that these papers were the papers of Peat, Marwick and Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.339" offset="3744684">And if they hadn't initiated this action, even though they were before the court we had no status to maintain as attorneys to the taxpayer, that's what the judge ruled at the trial level and that was the basis of his decision so on that basis he dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.163" offset="3816051">We then went to the Court of Appeals and the case was argued before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.645" offset="3841964">The Court of Appeals became concerned over what's going to happen if somebody doesn't answer and respond to one of these complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.950" offset="3875192">Can they just be taken in ex parte and held and judged in contempt and asked that be briefed?</text>
            <text syncTime="948.893" offset="3898911">And of course our is a case that holds that you can do precisely that just take the recalcitrant witness, ex parte into court and it can be immediately sentenced for contempt for failure to answer such a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.116" offset="3955858">But and the case was argued at length and brief and re-briefed before the Court of Appeals and then the Court of Appeals on February 7th entered its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.540" offset="4005491">Now the Court of Appeals states the facts just as I have given them to Your Honors here in the first two pages of its opinion and boils down the real allegations which are admitted in this complaint, in this language at 157 I mentioned this to you before, the essence of the complaint is that the summons called for the production of privilege matter, including the work product of counsel and were not issued for the purpose of assessing taxes or ascertaining the correctness of any return, but to obtain evidence for use in pending facts cases or to prosecute the taxpayers criminally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.260" offset="4176436">Then the court says that the district court had denied -- granted a motion to dismiss and entered findings, which I have described to Your Honor, but Judge Fahy of the Court of Appeals disregards those findings and says that that court is going to decide this case on an entirely different ground and here is what Judge Fahy said, “We think the complaint was properly dismissed, but for a different reason namely, that it is not within the court's jurisdiction because it is in substance a suit against the United States to which it has not consented.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.929" offset="4359084">And as a basis for this contention and finding the court cites Larson, Malone, United States versus Lee, the Dollar case, Larson again and the Wells, and the Louisiana cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.851" offset="4422823">So this is the basis on which the Court of Appeals decided, which is completely different from the court below, but we now have a situation where it is admitted, that you would have two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.484" offset="4481337">You have property of attorneys which is their work product and which we contend is privileged, being sought by revenue subpoena while still in the constructive possession of the attorneys because their accountants just like their law clerks are maintaining these papers for them and working over them in file preparations, in defense of civil and criminal cases too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.709" offset="4578200">We have respondent Caplin using a revenue subpoena and if Your Honors read the section you'll find it's only for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of taxes and collecting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.002" offset="4643401">Just bear in mind that Mr. Caplin has two sections in his department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.111" offset="4663777">He has got a police section which is run by the special agents and he has got a tax collection section which is run by the tax collectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.259" offset="4696377">And I respectively submit that Congress never intended to turn 7604 over to the police section or the treasury department to obtain evidence to be used in either a civil tax case or in criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.397" offset="4764923">There is nothing in the history that shows that was ever intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.419" offset="4781014">This is a section dealing only with determining the correctness of taxes and collecting them and so with -- and further that when he does this and uses the guides of subpoena to take from attorneys or accountants and from the constructive possession of the taxpayers through his lawyers, this is an unConstitutional act on his part and if you use the procedures and the statute would be unConstitutional because he can just do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.018" offset="4927404">There is no requirement of any showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.583" offset="4937749">For example one of the greatest rights, we have in this land, came from the Magna Carta and it was against unreasonable searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.068" offset="4971604">When that charter was written at Runnymede, you couldn't even get a search warrant on the affidavit of the officer no matter how strong it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.704" offset="5006190">You had to have a second person to swear to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.804" offset="5022595">Now we have put that in our Constitution so that when any person is to be searched or his property is to be seized or his papers taken, it can only be done on a showing of reasonable cause and Your Honors in writing the new Federal criminal rules have spelled that out very clearly and you have required this to be done by affidavit and that you must show facts not conclusions, that the crime has been committed and you must connect the person up with the crime against whom you are going to make the search, none of this in this particular section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.589" offset="5181733">So it's perfectly obvious, that to use this for police purposes is certainly a direct violation of Constitutional rights, what else did it do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.729" offset="5226245">It would absolutely destroy the effective assistance of counsel in every tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.197" offset="5256129">If you can permit the tax collecting side to use these subpoenas to get evidence to turn over to their police, the special agents as they are called, to turn over to grand juries to indict the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.722" offset="5322271">Now Congress never intended in this statute to give Mr. Caplin such power, but he proposes and in his brief he say he intends, then he thinks he is right that he can take these subpoenas, he can gather this material from the taxpayers, not the taxpayers, but the attorney's accountants and he can use it in both, civil tax cases against the taxpayer and in criminal proceedings and he even told Your Honors in his opposition to our petition, that in opposition when we requested a stay in this case, says he opposed a stay because the statute of limitation was getting very close to running on the criminal prosecution involved and in the tax court he asked the tax court to continue the tax cases until he got the evidence under these subpoenas because it would help him in the trial of those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.720" offset="5834271">So we were up against this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.575" offset="5845661">We couldn't have protected the rights of our clients if that had happened, they would had the papers let's be honest.</text>

They would have had them, and they would have photostated them, made copies of them, would we be protecting our clients in a situation like that if we didn't act as we did, I respectfully submit not and we don't have to wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.769" offset="5946493">The case is our legion that you don't have to wait for enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.812" offset="5974601">The cases arise when the taxpayers goes in court, a witness goes in court, they file a motion, they file a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.792" offset="5998529">They file an end reaction to have this subpoena measured as to validity in a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.107" offset="6023816">And the courts have said they will take jurisdiction over these matters and they have, on a multi -- in various ways, so I respectfully submit Mr. Justice Goldberg that we would have been lax if we had waited and let them go through enforcement to take the papers, copy them, use them in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.979" offset="6107303">Why can't it be settled in the District Court, all the parties are there, Caplin is there, his agency here, we have the accountants who've joined and you have the attorneys for the taxpayers to assert their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.843" offset="6158712">Now let's turn to the question which the Court of Appeals -- Mr. Justice Goldberg the case is Sale versus the United States, the decision of the Eight Circuit 228 F.2d 682, 21 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.191" offset="6248155">Now let us first turn to the basis upon which the Court of Appeals decided this case, that in effect this was a suit against the United States and let's analyze that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.099" offset="6295803">The Court of Appeals cites and this 32 -- commencing on page 9 of our brief, the Court of Appeals cites the decisions of this Court in Larson versus Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corporation and Malone versus Baldwin and states however that these two cases relied on concerns suits over property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.648" offset="6373961">But then the race, the distinction between those well defined categories of cases which are very carefully listed in Larson, so much so that Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his dissent complied an appendix, in these four categories and showed the full lines of cases within which the citizen can act against representatives of the government and where this defense of immunity from suit does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.601" offset="6485765">Mr. Justice Frankfurter lists these cases in this fashion; cases in which the plaintiff seeks an interest in property, which concededly even under the allegation of the compliant belongs to the government or calls for assertion of what is unquestionably official authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.329" offset="6552639">Now this is where you have a suit in which you cannot maintain your action; cases in which the action to the action to the legal detriment of plaintiff is taken by an official justifying his action under an unConstitutional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.017" offset="6615437">Now in those cases Your Honors have held that suits can be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.415" offset="6632991">The next category is cases where the plaintiff suffers a legal detriment through action of an officer who has exceeded his statutory authority and four cases where an officer seeks shelter behind statutory authority or some sovereign command for the commission of a common law tort.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.647" offset="6866004">From the Larson case Your Honor and I'm quoting in the footnote on page ten of my brief, which is taken from the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter where he lists these categories and then he lists all the cases that were decided under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.878" offset="6930892">We say this, that if in order to sustain the decision of the Court of Appeals on the admitted facts here, Your Honors are going to have to overrule the cases which we cite on page 11 of our brief, which commenced with the Lee case and end up with the Larson case, because Larson didn't hold you couldn't sue where there's an invasion of property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.107" offset="7023783">The Larson case says you can sue where you have an access of statutory authority or where you have unConstitutional actions by a government officer and there is nothing to the contrary in Malone versus Baldwin which merely followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.258" offset="7100374">These cases turn on property rights where an officer within his authority takes property under the authority of the United States, as just compensation is paid for these properties in these situations, you have a legal taking and the person goes to the Court of Claims or into some court to get his just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.161" offset="7188041">Your Honors have said in those cases where the taking is under the statute where you have a formal to get just compensation, then the proceedings are not illegal and you cannot restraint the person who acts, but just go back to Lee, which is typical example and let's look at these cases of what they really are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.150" offset="7276022">Here is the family General Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.631" offset="7285948">They have the -- a plot of ground opposite the end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, the Lee Mansion and his home site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.266" offset="7320430">The Lee went with the south, his property was seized by officer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.888" offset="7346970">It was then held by then under the guise that the Lees hadn't paid the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.771" offset="7370480">The Lees, of course it was impossible for them to pay the taxes, but they had a friend who offered to pay the taxes, and ultimately when the war was over the Lee family sued to get back their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.552" offset="7421576">This Court held that that was, did not vest title, that action by the officer hiding behind the refusal to take this tax bill and then contending that United States had titled because the taxes hadn't been paid, could not to be maintained as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.926" offset="7491062">Therefore, the officer was acting without any authority and the property belonged to the Lee family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.629" offset="7521886">As a result of this opinion, the Lee's got $3000 for the property we now have the Arlington Cemetery there and Lee's Mansion as a national memorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.779" offset="7566503">Then you can run through all of the rest of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.342" offset="7580714">If the officer has authority and he acts and he takes, this Court will not enjoin him, because he can get just compensation for the property that is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.036" offset="7627525">However, if you have a, an extension or exercise beyond the statutory authority and an invasion of rights, just as we have here, this Court has never hesitated to step into to protect the rights of citizens and their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.275" offset="7700459">And it should always protect against this sort of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.247" offset="7724387">Now the government argues that we are stopping the tax proceedings in their tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.735" offset="7758346">We know that is true, the cases have been tried, they weren't going to use this and they couldn't have used this on tax code anyway, we know the tax court will probably not receive this because it wasn't obtained under the procedures authorized by that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.229" offset="7812263">So nothing has been delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.273" offset="7820413">We had -- we stopped them certainly and then still an injunction against them, right to this very day for McLee which has been agreed upon throughout the court of appeals restraining them from enforcing these proceeding, because they said they are going ahead with it for criminal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.536" offset="7893556">So when you analyze this business of consent, it's not involved in this case at all, because Caplin is exceeding his statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.706" offset="7934203">Where does he get authority to subpoena counsel's records to use in a criminal case, to turn him over to the grand jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.320" offset="7972655">He certainly doesn't get it under this section and that is a collection section, not a police operated section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.217" offset="8004211">I am sure Mr. Justice Goldberg with his experience knows exactly how that bureau furnishes over there and if this is the way it operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.491" offset="8037334">And bear in mind, these subpoenas all were directed to be returned before the police and not before the tax collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.830" offset="8070666">They were all to be returned before the special agent and not the tax collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.832" offset="8138689">Then let us, the distinction between Larson may it please the Court, and the line of cases upon which the petitioner relies was clearly expressed by the Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia in the West Coast Exploration Company versus Mckay case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.881" offset="8194905">This is on page 13 of our brief and here is what the Court below in another case said in dealing with this principal of consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.515" offset="8285393">It was not charged in the complaint that war assets had acted beyond that authority or unConstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.668" offset="8317994">So how that case helps the Court below, I cannot see, because that Court admitted in its findings and its opinion that the complaint alleges just that and yet it says, Larson has authority for holding that this is a suit against the government that is there, has not consented therefore it cannot be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.123" offset="8407855">Now what did Larson say on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.126" offset="8419871">Everyone relies very heavily on the Larson case and here is what Your Honors said and this is quoted on page 15 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.484" offset="8453308">Where the officer's powers are limited by statute, his actions beyond those limitations are considered individual and not sovereign actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.129" offset="8491865">The officer is not doing the business would sovereign as empowered him to do or is he doing it in a way or is doing it in way which the sovereign has forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.876" offset="8538885">His actions are ultra vires his authority and therefore maybe made the object of specific relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.314" offset="8568665">It is important to note that in such case the relief can be granted without impleading the sovereign only because of the officer's lack of delegated power and to the same effect is a latter case of Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee versus McGrath in 341 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.579" offset="8653720">We cite this on page 41, what did Your Honor say there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.640" offset="8669915">Where an act of an official plainly falls outside the scope of his authority he does not make that act legal by doing it and then invoking the doctrine of administration construction to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.438" offset="8721115">And the Court of Appeals following the decisions what this Court has issued in the Dollar case over the years was ultimately resulted in contempt citations against various members of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice for failure to deliver the Dollar stock in compliance with the orders of this Court and the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.918" offset="8799065">Now Court of Appeals said this, in Dollar versus Land 154 FED 2nd 307, since the Court must determine at the offset its jurisdiction to proceed, it is compelled to make a preliminary decision for jurisdictional purposes on the ultimate question in the suit and is notwithstanding the fact that when the merits are heard it maybe compelled to reach an opposition conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.248" offset="13412394">Your Honors made that very clear in Hickman versus Taylor because there you had the broadest type of discovery authorized under Rule 26 of the Rule of the Civil Procedure, but you held very flatly you are not going to permit that rule to be used for this purpose, because it would, what it does, it destroys the office of an advocate, that what's it would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.376" offset="13492851">It means you got carry everything, he has to do it all along and to permit this work product that they reached in this manner wouldn't even be permissible under Rule 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.687" offset="13538095">Now, let's look at the criminal rules, where in the criminal rules did the government do this, but Your Honors promulgated under the Constitution, you don't authorize discovery by the United States to take a client by the (Inaudible), it's not authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.632" offset="13605909">And we say the Congress never intended to here and therefore this is an invasion of the client, attorney client privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.699" offset="14126164">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.597" offset="14149778">Let me just say at the outset that we don't have here any issue of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.549" offset="14181543">We don't have any issue here in view of the very careful professional arrangements that were made between the attorney or the attorneys and the accountants as to whether or not the accountants or the attorneys in this situation have a property interest sufficient to enable them to bring this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.061" offset="14283630">We also have tried to make it clear in our brief that any of these constitutional issues about self incrimination, and any of the other issues of whether the constitutional or ethical otherwise pertaining to intrusion on the attorney client privilege or intrusion on the attorney work product are assumed to be debatable in a subsequent enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.377" offset="14452903">Our position is first of all, that this action, against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on account the summons filed by a revenue agent subordinate of the commissioner is a suit against the United States to which it has not consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.729" offset="14546317">And in the alternative or in addition we show in our brief and argue here that there is no basis for this proceeding, because there is a complete inadequate remedy provided by Congress, a forum, opportunity for hearing on all of these objections should the subpoena documents be presented and an enforcement offers or order them sought with respect to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.020" offset="14715486">The context of a case like -- getting down to close quarters in a case like this sometimes causes you to loose perspective of the function of the whole tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.099" offset="14783718">We sometimes forget when we get down to close litigation on issues like this that our tax system is a self assessment system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.134" offset="14827917">It assumes that taxpayers voluntarily file full and complete returns and 60 million do every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.151" offset="14863966">It also assumes in order to function that those returns are subject to audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.934" offset="14895104">This is the way the system works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.750" offset="14906389">When somebody sits down and prepares his return, he knows or should know that he is going to be asked or maybe asked by revenue agent about the accuracy of what he says and maybe required to substantiate what is on the return and the internal revenue service in fact audits 3.5 million returns a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.697" offset="15010147">This law assumes that there must be a procedure for enforcing that law for enquiring closely to make sure that honest taxpayer isn't demoralized by the prospect or this will not beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.342" offset="15092694">And the Congress has had for long time statutory procedures whereby revenue agents can if a taxpayer is not or somebody who has had dealings with a taxpayer is not willing voluntarily to make his books and records available to have an administrative subpoena issued for the production of those books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.559" offset="15205648">The statute 7602 quoted on page 56 of our brief has been quoted before but we should use it as a point of departure, says that for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, it's one of the things, the secretary is delegate and in this the revenue agent in Honolulu especially agent Honolulu is authorized to examine books, to summon a person to bring books, papers, records, and other data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.534" offset="15341484">Now, we should look closely at the summons issued in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.062" offset="15371577">It appears there are several of them that were attached to the complaint, samples appear on pages 19 through 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.807" offset="15422568">The summons in this case was issued, or the summons were issued with respect to tax liability of the taxpayer Bromley but notice that the summons on page 19 refers to the years 1957, 1958, and 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.657" offset="15545971">These summons called for the books, documents, and records in the custody of the accountant which pertained to corporations listed below and all of their subsidiaries and on page 21 has set out the gamut of corporations through which it was suspected or believed that this taxpayer was operating through out the world, a very complex situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.425" offset="15673031">The subpoena further called, these reminds Your Honors on pages 20, these are books and records of corporations, no individual name there, the taxpayer himself was not named.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.966" offset="15739277">Then at the bottom of the page it called for audit reports, work papers and correspondence and this also related to the years 1957 through 1959, but it called for, in addition to some trade names, these are individuals and partnerships and included there for the years 1957 through 1959, audit reports, work papers, and correspondence in the custody of the accountants which pertained in those individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="4018.771" offset="16178448">This does involve the years 1953 through 1959, which includes the years involved in the Tax Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.169" offset="16220035">And it does, it is however limited to corporations and does not call for any records of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.238" offset="16256293">I cite this among other things Your Honors as an indication that the special agent in framing these subpoenas gave some thought, maybe he made a mistake in some respect but he did not write a rough shot or intended to write rough shot over the rights of the taxpayer as respect -- his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.406" offset="16369037">There maybe issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.211" offset="16376247">It may be that this subpoena called for things, some things with respect to which when the whole pile of books and papers call for were set down on a table and there was a colloquy about them there may have been found in a hearing before the special agent that some things were privileged or that some -- in the Constitutional sense or that some things called, some of the subpoena some of the things called for in the subpoena would not be proper for production because it intruded on the attorney-client privilege or because it involved bona fide work papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.886" offset="16566941">But to say that it's because they may have been produced in response to the summons, some things which were privileged is not say that the summons is therefore void as either exceeding the statutory authority of the commissioner or his agent or void in the sense that it intrudes on the constitutional rights of the taxpayer, who is – whose rights are to the matter of concern here and not so rather than the rights really of the attorney or the rights of the accountant.</text>

            <text syncTime="4184.346" offset="16840704">It would not -- it is the practice to use administrative subpoenas in investigations which involve -- which end up either in recommendations of criminal prosecution or decisions not to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.555" offset="16909563">It's a – once you are given the authority to determine the -- if the commissioner is given the authority of the statute to determine the correctness of the return, just first dealing with the statuary question before we get to some possible constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.619" offset="16965883">So far as the statute is concerned it would be very hard to start out determining the correctness of a return and then somehow switch off when it appeared for the first time that there was the possibility that there would be a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.493" offset="17053341">In determining the correctness of the return the fact is that maybe the public doesn't believe it, but the fact is that many returns are examined and found to be correct and that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.392" offset="17104959">If a return is found to be incorrect or if there is a reason to believe that the return is incorrect and one of two things happen; either the investigation is completed without any suspicion or determination of fraud and deficiency is asserted and either the tax is then paid administratively or the taxpayer uses his civil remedies in the tax court or by paying his tax and suing in various place for a refund and that process goes on quite by flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.317" offset="17236616">And the commissioner and his representative may also determine that by -- he may suspect that income has been omitted or that there he see -- what appears to be a forged document or other evidences of fraud, in that event he is still determining the correctness of the return and he pursues his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.466" offset="17313207">He may having investigated by use of summons or otherwise determine that there wasn't any fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.588" offset="17341733">The return is not correct, but there is no fraud that's it's resolved on a civil basis or if this revenue service and there are several echelons of procedure here, if the whole process of the revenue service determines that in their opinion the return is not only not correct, but that a violation of criminal statute has occurred they don't send the material to a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.292" offset="17468583">They send it to the -- they send the file to the Department of Justice and we make a determination as to whether we think the case should be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.669" offset="17502020">Now when they send the field they send everything they've collected by the civil process and by the criminal -- the intelligence investigation using summon.</text>
