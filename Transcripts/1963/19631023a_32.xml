            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">The Honorable James B. Parsons, judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Petitioner, versus the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="21.372" offset="188897">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.601" offset="205824">This case involves the issuance of a writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit directing the petitioner, a United States District Judge, to transfer a cause of action arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act to the Western District of Michigan, the Southern Division, sitting in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.653" offset="310000">Previous to the ruling by the petitioner, denying a motion to transfer made under Section 1404 (a) of the Judicial Code, the same case had been brought before the Circuit Court of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.678" offset="386069">There, the plaintiff's cause of action was dismissed by that Court on the ground of forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.969" offset="435284">A decision below issued the writ of mandamus on two grounds, on the grounds of full faith and credit as stated in Section 1738 of the Judicial Code and on its finding that the plaintiff was estopped by the previous ruling under a so-called estoppel by verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.061" offset="531623">Arguing on behalf of the petitioner here, I would contend that the decision of the court below is clearly incorrect in that the question is not a question of the statutory provision of full faith and credit creating any rights in the respondent here to have a particular ruling when it makes a motion under a federal provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.047" offset="651577">I would also contend today that there's an inter relationship between the acts involved herein that is Section 1404 (a), Section 1738 and Section 6 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.753" offset="722422">The case arose when an employee of the respondent by the name of Jack Filbrun was injured while attempting to release a hand break on a car in the respondent's yard at Ludington, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.543" offset="797550">He states that when he attempted to release this hand break, it suddenly quickly released causing him to fall from the car where he was caught by his conductor and was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.985" offset="855333">Subsequent, that injury occurred on the 15th of July in 1960, subsequent to that injury, he went to a Dr. Serb who was indentified in the record as a company doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.720" offset="910294">He was placed in a hospital and he was told by that doctor that there was nothing to matter with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.364" offset="936835">He went to other doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.643" offset="949896">One of the doctors, a Dr. Boelkins was a specialist to whom he was referred by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.011" offset="979466">Some of the other doctors were doctors of his own choosing.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Naughton</label>
            <text syncTime="239.152" offset="1060028">The situation came according to his affidavit, which is contained at pages 72 to 74 of the record that his physical situation was such that he was getting no relief, the company had a promised him a specialist.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.399" offset="1128991">He was not getting a specialist.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.503" offset="1137351">So at that time, he decided to go to his union attorneys in Chicago, seeking there basically medical help and as well legal help.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.874" offset="1186879">Now some points, it has been raised in the -- a brief respondent here that I am associated with the firm that represents Mr. Filbrun and that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.668" offset="1226062">I am also here by virtue of appointment by his Honor Judge Parsons.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.151" offset="1248005">In representing Judge Parsons here, I don't want to deceive the Court that I don't have a -- a special interest in this particular case being associated with the plaintiff's attorneys but the basic representation I would submit here by me is on behalf of Judge Parsons in advancing his ideas as to the judgment below issuing a writ of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.971" offset="1351241">The plaintiff when he came to Chicago was eventually placed under the care of Dr. Raven at the -- his attorney's reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.455" offset="1401187">The plaintiff was then hospitalized in Chicago for conservative treatment complaining of back condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.205" offset="1432221">After several weeks in the hospital, he was released, he was still complaining of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.019" offset="1447476">He was placed back in the hospital, a myelogram was performed and it was discovered that he had a disc by virtue of that myelogram.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.606" offset="1485824">He was then operated on and on the operation, disc -- herniated disc was found between the fifth lumbar and the second and this disc was herniated to such an extent that was encroaching on the spinal cord.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.165" offset="1547995">Now, that was removed, a spinal fusion was performed and he was under the care and treatment of Dr. Raven succeeding that operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.154" offset="1583940">Now, all of these facts here, I would think on first impression were not encompassed by the granting of the writ of certiorari by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.884" offset="1626885">However, in its brief, respondent contends that alternatively the court below ruled that the petitioner had abused his discretion in denying the motion of transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.854" offset="1694804">The only basis for that language is contained in the opinion of the Court in the last paragraph thereof at pages -- at page 87 in which the Court states referring to the previous reasons, these reasons are sufficient upon which the grant for issuance of the writ requested, the transfer of this case to the Federal District Court 60 miles from plaintiff's home, the scene of his accident all combined to establish that justice would there be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.749" offset="1822386">Now, I would suggest that that is not a square holding that the petitioner abused his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.255" offset="1856345">The dissent specifically finds that the petitioner did not abuse his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.202" offset="1880168">The opinion from which we are now arguing this case is the second opinion on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.253" offset="1912351">Previous to that, there was an opinion by which the petition for writ of -- of mandamus was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.522" offset="1949445">The dissenting opinion was the majority opinion at that time and there was a concurring opinion by retired Circuit Judge Major in which he states that he agrees with the now dissenting opinion that there had been no abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.831" offset="2018722">Under all of these circumstances, I would submit that there is no question of an abuse of discretion in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="726.125" offset="3007822">We do make a point that the ruling below and the contention of the respondent here seems to imply that the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division sitting in Chicago, Illinois and also by virtue of other division sitting in Freeport and Peoria, Illinois is the same as a court sitting in Cook County, Illinois, and we would contend that it is no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.827" offset="3122657">Moreover, the statutes of the United States permit subpoenas to be issued out of District Courts beyond state limits to the extent of a hundred miles from the place where the Court sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.930" offset="3183052">And for that reason, it can be seen that a District Court is not an Illinois Court that it is in fact an Illinois Court, an Indiana Court and a Wisconsin Court and an Iowa Court in certain instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.096" offset="3243760">The confusion of the opinion below is such that it would seem to bring into a play in this case the decision of Angel versus Boeing, which is a decision based in a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.318" offset="3320665">The reason I say that the opinion below brings this case into our case is because the Circuit Judge in rendering his opinion to pay some particular attention to the fact that the Circuit Court of Cook County and the United States District Court or courts of concurrent jurisdiction under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.316" offset="3420662">That is under Section 6 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, a -- a plaintiff has a cause of action may sue in either a state court or a federal court is given that choice of forum and that's a very valuable choice of forum given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.646" offset="3493909">The Circuit Judge Schnackenberg says that his ruling, and I quote from page 86, a one sentence after the full faith and credit determination, "This especially true because if it's a court of concurrent jurisdiction in administering the Federal Employers' Liability Act as provided in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.596" offset="3597772">"Now, with all due difference to the court below, that ruling is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.832" offset="3634657">That is taking a valuable right given to a plaintiff and interpreting it so that it becomes no right at all, so that it is actually a sword turned inwards and diminishing the plaintiff's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.419" offset="3705083">Now, the second question cited below was the estoppel by verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.157" offset="3727966">I would say as to that, the nature of the decision below is such that there is no finality in the matter and I think that basically, the court below again is confused itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.713" offset="3790242">It is saying that a decision on a motion for forum non conveniens is a decision on a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.137" offset="3827963">It's a decision such as would be involved in saying that a particular piece of paper was a deed of the transfer property to (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="942.543" offset="3873520">That is not what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.064" offset="3883656">I think that looking at the standards, considering the -- maybe this nature of the standards, the individual characteristics of each District Judge and the discretion vested in each judge to decide these questions, we must say that there's a certain amount of weighing and balancing here as Mr. -- Circuit Judge Frank said in the Ford Motor Company decision and that -- well, we say that these are determinations of facts we only confuse ourselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.511" offset="6429445">I suppose that there are three different phases of this argument that I should address myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.469" offset="6465285">In the first, did the District Court give the proper recognition to the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County dismissing the case under forum non conveniens?</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.028" offset="6511470">Secondly, did the District Court properly determine that transfer to the Western District of Michigan was not in the language of the statute for the convenience of the parties and the witnesses and the interests of justice?</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.908" offset="6590986">And thirdly, if either of those two questions should be answered in the negative, was mandamus a proper remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.241" offset="6628289">Now, what was the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County?</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.269" offset="6652426">The Circuit Court of Cook County determined that under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, under the common law of doctrine of forum non conveniens, the trial of this case in Cook County was inappropriate and inconvenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.559" offset="6721599">Now, along with the common law doctrine, the Illinois state courts seem to hold or seem to require based upon this Cotton case, a -- a requirement must be present that an addition to be inconvenient and inappropriate, the trial court must find that the plaintiff acted with a motive to vex and harass the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.176" offset="6848031">The Circuit Court of Cook County did dismiss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.794" offset="6870497">While there is no finding of fact, the judgment of the Court being a mere judgment of dismissal under Illinois law, the grounds for the judgment can be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.635" offset="6921906">And we find this to be the fact that the Court dismissed the action based upon the same allegations, the same affidavits that were present before the United States District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.474" offset="6985226">To support its motion, the Railroad showed that there were five occurrence witnesses and six doctors all of whom resided in and about Ludington, Michigan, two doctors being in Grand Rapids.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.767" offset="7054399">The Court found that the case should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.644" offset="7077909">Now, instead of going to the convenient forum Ludington, the plaintiff walked down the streets about two blocks and filed suit in the United States District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.194" offset="7372152">In the Cotton case, the accident as I recall happened in Kentucky and the trial was in East St. Luis and there was an allegation that the -- in the motion to dismiss under forum non conveniens that the plaintiff could not get -- or the defendant could not produce the medical evidence just as there was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.962" offset="7451251">On the trial, the -- and this was how the case was reviewed, the evidence showed there -- there was -- but one doctor who testified and he spent less than a day and the Court found that there was no inconvenience and seemed to imply that there should be vexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.337" offset="7516766">Now, there has been -- there have been other forum non conveniens’ decisions in Illinois, but none of them on FELA cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.926" offset="7559084">Now, I don't think that there is any differentiation when the case reaches the District Court whether it's an estoppel by verdict, collateral estoppel, res judicata, full faith and credit or what.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.846" offset="8042768">In other words, if the state court had not made a final judgment, if the case had been submitted and a voluntary dismissal made, then of course there would be no prohibition at all, but the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County was a final appealable judgment and therefore, it was res judicata, estoppel by verdict, collateral estoppel, when they -- that matter was brought before the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.558" offset="8261569">I -- I take it that there is a comparatively little argument made or even -- the argument is not even particularly addressed to that trial in Grand Rapids was for the convenience of the parties and the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.636" offset="8317889">There was, but one witness in Illinois and that after the injured man had retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.619" offset="8361880">A simple 1101 arithmetic indicates the convenience of the parties and the witnesses and I would say here that there is and will be a serious issue as to the extent of this man's injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.478" offset="8417259">Six doctors concluded that he was not injured and one found that he was and operated on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.965" offset="8451218">These men will be called upon by the Railroad to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.228" offset="8476296">Were the trial to take place in Cook County, the railroad would be deprived of the in-person evidence of these witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.346" offset="8560724">Transfer to Grand Rapids would make that available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.206" offset="8588204">It is, therefore, my conclusion and I believe that the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed that failing to transfer based upon that record was a gross abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.926" offset="8651107">Now, counsel has pointed to the opinion and says this is not a square holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.915" offset="8671065">The petition for writ of mandamus claimed that the judgment of the District Court was an abuse of discretion as well as claiming our rights under the full faith and credit statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.907" offset="8726967">The Court ruled upon it and under familiar rules, its judgment can be supported both on the grounds of the full faith and credit statute and under the abuse of discretion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.240" offset="8796348">I think that the Court did find that it was an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.677" offset="8822053">Of course, the Court was more -- merely acted interested in the collateral estoppel argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.056" offset="8875551">If we concede that there is grounds to claim that there was error in the District Court, I would like to address myself to the argument that mandamus was an appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.419" offset="8941066">I believe Mr. Justice Stewart asked the counsel if in his judgment he believed that the interlocutory appeal statute was available here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.903" offset="8991013">The interlocutory appeal statutes requires a finding in the order that a controlling principle of law is involved and a finding that the ultimate disposition of a case will be advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.053" offset="9067604">There was no such finding in the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.978" offset="9087248">True, none was requested, but as it stood, there was no way when that order was entered that it could have been appealed under that -- under that provision of the statute, but I would say even further an interlocutory appeal here would not be any different, the -- the posture of the case would be no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.444" offset="9201142">It would be exactly the same as it would be under the writ of mandamus proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.395" offset="9644910">But on the issue -- issue of the mandamus itself, under the All Writs Act, I believe that it has everywhere been considered that the Court of Appeals does have the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.438" offset="9717112">It's not a question of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.840" offset="9734771">And the cases that had been here, I don't think anyone has urged that the Court under proper circumstances could issue a writ of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.660" offset="9785971">We, therefore past as to whether writ of mandamus is proper in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.315" offset="9816586">To a degree of course, this is a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.327" offset="9836648">I think that the holding of this Court in La Buy versus Howse is most persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.865" offset="9866846">In that case, Judge La Buy had transferred a case to a master court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.238" offset="9904358">A petition for writ of mandamus was filed in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and it issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.593" offset="9933720">And this Court affirmed even though the propriety of the issuance of the writ was strongly challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.699" offset="9966216">This Court twice has held that a jury demand should be recognized and mandamused, the trial court twice to preserve that remedy even though in both cases, the Courts of Appeal had not acted on the petition for writ of mandamus, in other words, they had denied the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.686" offset="10074154">Yet this Court felt that the control of the process of litigation, the jury demand in the two instances was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.518" offset="10117413">I would say this that particularly under 1404 (a) cases, if the respondent is ever to have a remedy, it must be by way of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.230" offset="10184286">If it goes to trial, the inconvenience and the lack of justice has been suffered and then the respondent, defendant, is in the position of trying to show prejudicial error and it's difficult if not impossible to point to one specific thing and say, prejudicial error has been suffered by the failure to transfer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.882" offset="10302882">It can always be claimed that the evidence of doctors being presented by way of deposition adequately -- was adequate in the defense of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.824" offset="10358680">Every trial lawyer faced with convincing the jury knows that depositions are not a persuasive way of presenting key evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.877" offset="10406849">The cost has been incurred so that the remedy if we are going to have it appealable at all must be undertaken prior to the time the trial was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.665" offset="10478007">I think that proper administration of justice indicates that in proper cases, the Courts of Appeal should issue the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.366" offset="10516877">Now, I do recognize that there is at least one decision and I believe it's cited in the brief of the Court of Appeals, I believe in Tenth Circuit holds that even though there was a proper case and abuse of discretion, the writ should not issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.428" offset="10593050">Most of the other circuits have taken the other view and I think in proper administration of justice that should be the view of this Court.</text>
