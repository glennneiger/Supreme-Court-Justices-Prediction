            <text syncTime="587.116" offset="2451832">It was upon this ground that the trial court finally denied the motion of the petitioner in the trial court to suppress all evidence that was raised and seized upon that search including an alleged statement that was given by the petitioner to the arresting officers after the contraband was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.056" offset="2643571">On Monday of this week, this Court, in Stoner against California, indicated in very strong terms that a person having legitimate claim to protection of his right against search and seizure has standing an interest to complain of it regardless of who else may have consented to the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.611" offset="6985853">This case is here on a writ of certiorari from the Second Circuit to review two separate dismissals and presents basically two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.036" offset="7035486">The first question is, when the last day to file a notice of appeal is a Saturday, whether the notice of appeal filed on Monday will suffice because of -- of a number of reasons either at the New York -- certain courts in New York have a practice where they exclude Saturday or because the clerk's office -- the federal clerk's office in New York was open only half a day on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.863" offset="7150843">The second appeal which was dismissed presents the second question which in substance is whether an appeal maybe revived after the time -- the 10-day period has expired by a nominal reduction in a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.392" offset="7236942">In other words, may the District Judge deliberately enlarge the period for taking an appeal from 10 days to -- such as this case, a period of a month and a half?</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.755" offset="9078366">At the outset, I think I should make the -- the Government's position clear about two matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.457" offset="9109191">We do not say that the rule should not be changed or that this rule is the best rule that could be devised and certainly, the Rules Committee have these rules under consideration and that's why they're rules so that they'd be -- can be continually looked at in view of our experience and possibly some changes made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.620" offset="9189857">The second thing is that we feel that in 1960, when this Court decided United States versus Robinson, that to a great extent, the excuses that are now offered in this case are of no different caliber or no different substance than the excuses that we're offered in Robinson and at that time, it was decided that the period for appeal cannot be enlarged, where the failure to take the appeal was due to the neglect of counsel even though it was excusable neglect of the counsel.</text>
