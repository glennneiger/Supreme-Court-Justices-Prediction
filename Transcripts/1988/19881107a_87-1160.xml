            <text syncTime="14.432" offset="199557">Duquesne Light Company and Pennsylvania Power Company are regulated public utilities in the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.634" offset="228397">They are obliged by statute to provide adequate and reasonably continuous electrical service to their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.390" offset="263401">To fulfill their statutory duty to serve, Duquesne and Penn Power are required to anticipate and provide for future energy needs and demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.319" offset="315123">During the 1970s, Duquesne and Penn Power spent $50 million in planning and preparing for the construction of four nuclear power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.826" offset="357128">The utilities decided to build these plants in response to extreme pressure from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission as well as regulatory authorities in neighboring states.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.924" offset="401536">The Commission believed in 1973 when the decision to build was made that additional generating capacity was needed to meet expected demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.990" offset="441765">Accordingly, Duquesne and Penn Power spent $50 million for, among other things, architectural and engineering services, surveying, construction planning, supplies, preparation of licensing applications and consulting fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.151" offset="502473">In January 1980, as a result of unforeseen and unforeseeable changes of circumstances, Duquesne and Penn Power cancelled the four nuclear plants and did not proceed with the actual construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.929" offset="561510">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania because the state has sought to deny Duquesne and Penn Power any opportunity at all to recover any portion whatever of the $50 million the utilities spent in planning for and preparing to build the four cancelled plants.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.334" offset="831198">But I honestly think that under the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and under its reading of the statute, Section 1315 of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Code, we would not succeed in that effort on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.164" offset="894519">Indeed, I suspect that my adversary here, the Consumer Advocate, would say that that is just a way of accomplishing in one manner what cannot be accomplished in another, and that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has said on page 14a of the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement this shall not be done in any way whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.400" offset="1659384">--Well, Your Honor, we've been confronted in this case with a very broad reading of the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.583" offset="1680178">As you know, the Public Utility Commission of Pennsylvania granted 10-year amortization of the $50 million in expenses that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.523" offset="1731900">And that ruling, which appears in Appendices C and E of the Appendix, was sustained by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, both of whom interpreted the statute not to apply to a situation involving cancelled plants, but merely to be a timing measure with respect to the time of recovering the cost of construction work in progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.488" offset="1831792">Both the Commission and the Commonwealth Court said that the statute was only designed to make certain that the Commission understood that its pre-existing practice was not to be changed and that with respect to plants not yet on-line, construction work in progress was not to be included in rates in any way until such time as the plants went into service.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.453" offset="1915593">But both the Commission and the Commonwealth Court thought that the statute did not apply to the cancelled plant situation or to the plant taken out of service before the costs incurred in building that plant had been completely recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.680" offset="1968570">Both of those things they said were not covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.832" offset="1981108">But our opponents disagreed and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court disagreed and said I believe in no uncertain terms that these expenses were simply out of the equation, not to be considered, not to be recovered, to be treated as if they had not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.771" offset="2040877">And that is what brings us to this Court today because there are several key facts about this dispute... about this case that, I should say, are not disputed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.228" offset="2078702">It's common ground that the utilities' decision to begin work on these four plants was a prudent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.394" offset="2107437">It's also accepted that the $50 million of expenses were prudently incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.676" offset="2128543">There's no controversy about the amount of money that was actually spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.089" offset="2142232">Finally, everyone agrees that the decisions by the utilities in January 1980 to cancel the plants was prudent under all the circumstances then prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.146" offset="2186431">So, the fact of the matter is that at every step along the way, the utilities did just what prudent, well-managed utilities were supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.932" offset="2221539">They behaved just the way the Commission wanted them to behave and they invested their capital not for some frivolous purpose, but for the purpose of providing the electric service to their customers that they must provide under Pennsylvania law.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.521" offset="2271903">These expenses that we're arguing about today were not wasted in any real sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.567" offset="2308057">The money had to be spent to put the utilities in the position to go forward with construction if the conditions warranted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.760" offset="2568863">Of course, that begs the question of what it means for a rate order to be confiscatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.082" offset="2586104">The first... Mr. Justice Harlan back in Smyth v. Ames said that the question of how you determine whether a rate order is confiscatory and the necessary elements in that inquiry will always be what he called an embarrassing question.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.762" offset="2648903">Well, it remains an embarrassing question today because it is not easy to know how one tells whether a rate order is or is not confiscatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.378" offset="2683384">In our view, this rate order is confiscatory within the meaning of Hope Natural Gas simply because $50 million worth of prudently incurred expenses, expenses incurred for the sole purpose of providing electric service, have been ignored, and on remand, they must continue to be ignored.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.428" offset="6787535">In our view, the question presented in this appeal is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.312" offset="6803103">That question is whether a public utility has a constitutional right to charge ratepayers for the cost of any particular investment even where the denial of recovery of that investment is not alleged to have any significant impact on the utility's overall rate level or financial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.373" offset="6875306">Our proposed response to that question and the framework for my argument today is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.016" offset="6901846">First, and most importantly, I will argue that the Court should simply reaffirm the Hope Natural Gas decision and thereby reject the utilities' appeal in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.482" offset="11699704">Duquesne and Penn Power investors were never told by the state that they would be guaranteed recovery of investments which provide no service to ratepayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.093" offset="11766160">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in this case that the used and useful principle was established as a matter of state law... a matter of state ratemaking policy long before the enactment of the specific ratemaking provision at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.572" offset="11824152">Neither before nor after Hope, has this Court ever ruled that a utility has a constitutional right to charge ratepayers either a return on or a recovery of non-used and useful investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.173" offset="11878486">There is, therefore, no basis upon which the utilities can now claim that their investors were unaware that there was at least a risk that non-used and useful investments would continue to be excluded from the ratemaking equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.389" offset="11931358">The companies' argument would turn nearly every rate disallowance in every rate order into a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.416" offset="11971482">The acceptance of the companies' argument would return this Court and all reviewing courts to the pre-Hope era where generous rate increases to financially sound utilities could be attacked as confiscatory because of the failure to approve a specific cost item in a constitutionally proscribed manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.736" offset="12036788">The states would be unable to apply any other economic or policy considerations in determining how to set just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.663" offset="12068449">The companies' argument also fails to recognize that ratemaking is an ongoing, dynamic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.319" offset="12095094">Duquesne Light Company has had five base rate cases just during the pendency of the appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.271" offset="12114947">In upholding the Federal Power Commission's order in the Hope case, the court recognized that this is not an order for all time and that the doors of the Commission are open for increased allowances that prove to be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.189" offset="12162594">Rather than assigning constitutional status to every dollar of every rate claim of every public utility in the United States, we would respectfully ask the Court to reaffirm the Hope decision and deny the companies' appeal in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.703" offset="12244619">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.005" offset="12273876">My adversary has concentrated a lot on a individual item and says that our claim is a claim for an individual item of investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.473" offset="12315672">Our claim is a claim for a constitutional method of setting rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.885" offset="12333330">If Pennsylvania... and my opponent has not denied it... fixes rates of return based on prudent investment and a reasonable rate of return, the lowest reasonable rate based on the original cost-prudent investment method, which is what Pennsylvania does under Section 1311 of the Public Utility Code, then Pennsylvania must under the Constitution under the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments permit the recovery of prudent expenses incurred for the provision of electric service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.874" offset="12445343">If Pennsylvania follows the fair value method, which is what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court suggests, Justice Kennedy, on page 21a of the opinion, but which seems to fly in the face of what the Commission actually does and what Section 1311 says, then the value of the used and useful plants and the rate of return on those plants can be adjusted to take into account expenses prudently incurred but not producing electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.141" offset="12546385">That is not what happens in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.452" offset="12555685">That's not what happened in this case, and that's why we're here complaining because the $50 million that Penn Power and Duquesne Light spent will never be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.919" offset="12593510">We will never be able to recover on a Mustang the losses that we've incurred on an Edsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.475" offset="12615766">That is the problem that we are bringing to the Court's attention because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has specifically ruled that Section 1315 precludes that kind of counterbalancing that normally would occur under the fair value regime that was originally envisioned by this Court in Smyth v. Ames.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.826" offset="12685148">That's not what Pennsylvania does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.836" offset="12693193">If the $50 million... and you did not hear my opponent say that the rate of return could be increased to take account of these costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.891" offset="12717435">That's contrary to his position, and it's contrary to the position that he would espouse on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.712" offset="12736661">Thank you.</text>
