            <label>Mr. Joel B. Rudin</label>
            <text syncTime="16.543" offset="210377">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.917" offset="227827">This case is here on a petition of certiorari to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.322" offset="257502">At issue is whether the Federal Magistrates Act authorizes a magistrate to conduct jury selection in a felony trial over the Defendant's objection and if so, whether that procedure is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.959" offset="307971">The government concedes that the Magistrate's Act provides no felony trial jurisdiction for magistrates, but to save this conviction, it argues that despite this Court's cases, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Speedy Trial Act and common usage referring to jury selection as a part of trial, that Congress nevertheless understood jury selection to be a pretrial duty and intended it to be authorized by the pretrial duty section of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.766" offset="415282">We think Congress had no such intention, that Congress understood that jury selection was part of trial and that when it precluded magistrates from exercising felony trial jurisdiction, it understood that preclusion to encompass the jury selection phase of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.097" offset="476617">The Magistrate Act recognizes the right of litigants to trial before a district court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.523" offset="502322">It makes an exception to that right only where the litigants explicitly consent, and then only in misdemeanor, petty offense or civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.018" offset="536281">Congress nowhere in the statutory language or in the legislative history gives any indication of any intent to make an exception for the jury selection phase of a felony trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.795" offset="583406">As a matter of fact, in the civil trial section of the Magistrates Act, Congress provides for litigants to consent to any or all proceedings in a civil case to be conducted by a magistrate, suggesting that Congress considered the possibility that a magistrate might conduct a part of the civil trial, yet there is absolutely no language indicating that Congress had any understanding that a magistrate might conduct any part of a felony trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.712" offset="687059">Particularly where Congress was so careful to require consent for misdemeanor, petty offenses and for civil trials, it doesn't make sense that Congress would have permitted magistrates to conduct the critically important jury selection phase of trial, which this Court has repeatedly referred to as integral to trial, without the party's consent... the Defendant's consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.611" offset="974615">One of the most important reasons is the reasoning that I just alluded to, which is that despite the language used in the additional duties clause, Congress... Congress and the government concedes that the trial provisions of the act preclude any felony trial jurisdiction and there's no indication that Congress intended an exception for jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.265" offset="1053192">I think that the... the importance... importance of the government's concession is even more than that, because in effect what the government concedes is that you have to look to the balance of the act and to look to the duties that Congress explicitly authorized or chose not to authorize, and it would defeat the purpose of this comprehensive statute, which Congress amended in 1976 precisely for the purpose of clarifying and defining the duties that magistrates might exercise and the standards of procedures for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.495" offset="1174191">It would defeat that comprehensive purpose to allow the additional duties clause to override the balance of the statute.</text>

Your Honor, they use the language that we intend to permit district judges to innovate or to experiment, but the question is whether or not the innovation and the experimentation that they had in mind was the assignment of constitutionally important adjudicative functions that elsewhere in the statute it declined to authorize magistrates to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.301" offset="1317342">The legislative history makes that even clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.074" offset="1332493">The legislative... the House and Senate... the authoritative House and Senate reports indicate, after using the language that we intend to encourage experimentation or innovation, that it had in mind administrative-type functions in aid of the business of the courts, precisely for the purpose of freeing up district judge... judges for their vital and traditional adjudicatory duties, which Congress repeatedly recognized involved most significantly a felony trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.200" offset="1876989">--But not necessarily the most important role under Article &lt;III&gt; [= III].</text>
            <text syncTime="438.413" offset="1897887">The Framers, I think, understood... and this has been repeatedly referred to in this Court's decisions... in Northern Pipeline, in... in other cases involving Article III, the Court has appeared to assume that criminal trials are different, and the reason that they're different is because the... the liberty interest of the litigant is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.926" offset="1971866">In addition, there's the greatest danger of outsider majoritarian pressure and for these reasons, if... if there is an absolute right under Article III to have the personal presence of a fully independent district court judge, it would appear to me that it would have to be the criminal trial... or at least the felony trial, where the most is at stake and where the values underlying Article &lt;III&gt; [= III] of independent, impartial adjudication are potentially most at risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.555" offset="2074371">Congress must have understood that jury selection was part of trial when it wrote the statute in 1968 and when it revised it in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.711" offset="2118988">In Swain v. Alabama, this Court noted the long and widely-held belief that jury selection was, as the Court held in Lewis against United States in 1892 that v. Alabama, which was decided only three years before this statute was written in 1968, the Court repeatedly referred to Lewis against United States and repeatedly held that the Defendant had a right to be present during jury selection, because jury selection was part of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.552" offset="2234344">The Speedy Trial Act was implemented in 1975, just a year before the revisions to the Magistrates Act, and in the Speedy Trial Act, Congress used the concept of trial and that... that has been repeatedly interpreted by the courts... although not yet by this Court... to include jury selection within the concept of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.064" offset="2312398">And the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 24, dealing with jury selection, is... is under the section, trial, and Rule 43A refers to jury selection as being part of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.774" offset="2359314">So there is every reason to believe that when Congress wrote and revised this statute that Congress assumed, according to common usage and the decisions of this Court and the Rules of Criminal Procedure, that jury selection was part of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.862" offset="2407588">There's simply no reason to believe that Congress intended... an unorthodox understanding or view of jury selection, particularly that either it was not part of trial or that it was preliminary to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.689" offset="2454922">And there is no reason to believe that Congress intended any exception, if it viewed it as part of trial, given the total absence of any such reference in the statutory language or in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.617" offset="2494628">This is a comprehensive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.259" offset="2501211">Congress repeatedly indicated in 1976 that it intended to, in light of this Court's restrictive ruling in Wingo v. Wedding and the restrictive decisions of lower court cases interpreting the original Magistrates Act, that it... it intended to clarify and to specifically define the duties of magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.252" offset="2569234">Most importantly, where constitutionally significant functions were involved, to... Congress required a very careful and thorough review structure and the more significant the function, the more careful the review structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.120" offset="2616673">And wherever a function was involved that Congress considered to be particularly important, it required de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.977" offset="2640078">Nevertheless, the government argues here for the first time that jury selection is a pretrial duty that falls under the pretrial duty section of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.063" offset="2676441">The government, even though it now contends that that flows from the plain language of the statute, did not make that argument in the court below and it has not been accepted by any other court that has considered this issue, not even by the dissenters in the Fifth Circuit in the Ford case.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.161" offset="2724819">The government's position does not make sense when one analyzes the structure of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.877" offset="2747703">The Act divides pretrial duties into dispositive and nondispositive duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.811" offset="2771422">And as I mentioned before the dispositive duties, which are the more important, duties, all require de novo review and they're specifically listed, yet jury selection is not listed amongst those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.298" offset="2809352">The nondispositive duties require the magistrate to... to finally determine... to actually enter a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.204" offset="2841012">There's no statutory procedure for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.646" offset="2850730">There is a recognition of a standard of review, but that standard is the highly deferential, clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard, which is plainly inadequate under this Court's decision in Raddatz, but more importantly for the purpose of interpreting this statute, it's plainly inconsistent with Congress' understanding that for constitutionally more significant functions de novo review is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.202" offset="2941009">The legislative history supports this interpretation, because repeatedly in the floor debate, in the subcommittee hearings and in the committee reports, Congress referred to the nondispositive duties as the preliminary processing of cases, procedural matters to get cases ready for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.968" offset="3024078">And the specific duties that it referred to in the legislative reports were all of this nature: ruling on continuances, holding scheduling conferences, ruling on matters of discovery, ruling on motions directed to the sufficiency of the pleadings and holding pretrial conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.101" offset="3092624">I suggest that jury selection, even in Congress' understanding, could not possibly have been considered comparable to these more procedural and less constitutionally-significant functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.947" offset="3135987">Turning to the additional duties clause, Justice O'Connor, the absence of any provision for review with respect to duties under the additional duties clause I think says a lot about the limited scope of duties that Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.352" offset="3221564">As I said before, wherever Congress had in mind constitutionally-significant functions, Congress provided for structure of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.078" offset="3256464">Yet with additional duties, there's absolutely no structure of review, no standard of review which suggests that what Congress had in mind for additional duties was more limited ministerial or administrative tasks; and those, in fact, are the kinds of duties that Congress listed in the committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.659" offset="3322815">Congress listed such things as reviewing default judgments, appointing CJA counsel, exonerating or forfeiting ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.904" offset="3347788">There was absolutely no statement of an... an intention to enhance the jurisdiction of magistrates using the vehicle of the additional duties clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.476" offset="6470047">I think it's significant that there's absolutely no discussion of it in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.871" offset="6487706">It... it's inconceivable to me that Congress would have intended the function of jury selection not to be viewed as part of trial without any such discussion, and the most logical explanation for why there was no discussion is because Congress assumed, like this Court, like the Federal Rules, that it was part of trial and therefore it's not... that function is precluded under the trial provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.926" offset="6583837">Finally, I would just like to note concerning the question of harmless error, that in Wingo v. Wedding, involving the construction of the Magistrate's Act in connection with the Habeas Corpus Act, after holding that the Magistrate... that assigning the function of holding an evidentiary hearing was inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Act, this Court reversed without conducting any harmless error analysis, presumably because the Court reasoned that Congress had not empowered magistrates to conduct habeas corpus hearings, and for the same reason we believe there should be a reversal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.939" offset="6715912">Congress did not empower magistrates to conduct jury selection in a felony trial, which is the other point I wanted to make in response to Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.286" offset="6869303">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.268" offset="6885290">Congress designed the Magistrates Act to help district court judges cope with their overwhelming case loads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.582" offset="6910472">Congress wrote the statute in broad terms and specifically stated both in passing and in amending the act that its purpose was to encourage experimentation in the use of magistrates up to the limits of Article III in order to help district court judges dispense justice more efficiently and expeditiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.955" offset="6984033">There should be little question in this case but that the plain terms of the statute permit district court judges to delegate jury selection to magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.891" offset="7019768">Technically there are two separate provisions of the Act which permit that delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.144" offset="7040771">First, Section 636(b)(1) permits district court judges to delegate pretrial matters to magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.250" offset="7077133">Now, as Justice Scalia pointed out, the term pretrial is subject to different interpretations, and the commencement of trial has been fixed at different points for different purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.888" offset="7119765">Well, what I was thinking of when I was when I was making that comment earlier is that this (b)(1)(a), which is what you're now referring to, says a judge may designate a magistrate... it just doesn't say pretrial matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.995" offset="7164173">It says a magistrate to hear and determine any pretrial matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.050" offset="7184339">Does anybody hear and determine the seating of a jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.682" offset="7202939">It's a very strange terminology to apply to that, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.374" offset="7377646">We think the better argument is that jury selection is logically distinct from and prior to the trial itself for this purpose, which begins with the swearing in of the jury, introductory arguments and presentation of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.413" offset="7433861">However, Congress anticipated the ambiguity and therefore provided in a separate subsection, Section 636 &lt;b@l three&gt; [= (b)(3)], that magistrates may be delegated</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.249" offset="7477224">"such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.195" offset="7504914">Congress expressly stated in both the House and Senate reports that the purpose of this provision was to permit district courts to</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.959" offset="7759974">But merely because one thinks the experiment may be a less good idea or a bad idea, even, is not sufficient grounds given that Congress has expressly authorized it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.782" offset="7959340">For example, we don't suggest that the additional duties clause allows magistrates to try felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.278" offset="7989329">Congress specifically provided in the Act that magistrates could try misdemeanors and civil trials with the consent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.062" offset="8020467">It did not go on and say that they could try felony cases with or without the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.486" offset="8042096">So the additional duties provision does not make superfluous what went before, either in terms of the matters that can be heard or the specific standard of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.004" offset="13460206">In footnote number 11 of my reply brief I quote the government stating in Raddatz that the pretrial suppression hearing involves deterrence of official misconduct and... and the exclusion of inherently reliable evidence as opposed to the accused's paramount interest in his liberty at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.386" offset="13525721">The government argued in Raddatz, indeed, the Defendant's stake in the outcome of a suppression hearing is significantly less than the individual interest implicated by various civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.392" offset="13561770">Now the government comes before this Court and argues that somehow the Defendant's interest in a suppression hearing is more important than his interest in jury selection, which in case after case after case, this Court has held is vitally important to the fairness of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.342" offset="13621538">I would suggest that... that the... I would also say that this Court has repeatedly stated, for example in Wainwright v. Witt that de novo review is impossible in the jury selection context because of the importance of the fact-finder being present and observing the demeanor of jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.332" offset="13681515">Where a juror is erroneously excluded by a magistrate, that juror is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.303" offset="13697397">He can't be requestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.365" offset="13701682">Where defense counsel exercises a peremptory challenge because the magistrate has erroneously denied his challenge for cause, that juror has gone as well.</text>
