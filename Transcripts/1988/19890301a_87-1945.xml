            <text syncTime="15.660" offset="207591">Does the Free Exercise Clause extend protection only to persons who are members of established religious organizations and who exercise the beliefs of those organizations?</text>
            <text syncTime="26.365" offset="250432">That's the issue this case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.583" offset="259314">William A. Frazee believes it's wrong to perform nonessential work on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="275510">His beliefs are based on his religious convictions as a Christian.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.339" offset="290347">Now, nonessential to Mr. Frazee means any work that does not directly relate to the preservation of human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.077" offset="317306">In 1984, he worked for the State of Illinois and was laid off, and during that time he remained on call to return to his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.183" offset="349698">In addition, he performed temporary employment through Kelly Services, Incorporated, and performed all assignments that were given to him until April of 198--</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. French</label>
            <text syncTime="63.423" offset="398599">--Well, the record shows that he had... he testified during the hearing that he had one assignment previous to the job that came up in April of 1984, and then there was one afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.964" offset="448858">So, in fact, the... he had two assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="463800">In... on April of 1984, he was given a five... an offer of a five-day position beginning, he was told, Wednesday, May 9, and going through Sunday, May 13, 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.843" offset="512284">The position was a retail clothing position, salesman.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.062" offset="529211">When he was informed that the work included Sunday work, he inquired as to whether the work could be limited from Wednesday through Saturday, and was informed that unless the... he was available for Sunday work, he wouldn't be considered for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.935" offset="580724">At that time, he declined the employment, citing his religious belief against Sunday labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.506" offset="599010">Now, after that, Mr. Frazee attempted to obtain continuing unemployment benefits from the Department of Employment Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.112" offset="629417">During the proceedings, he at all times acted pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.647" offset="643523">The first... and I should say the Illinois statute that we have before the Court today is very similar to the statutes that this Court considered in the Sherbert and the Thomas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.872" offset="688453">In order to remain eligible for unemployment benefits under the Illinois statute, a person must not refuse an offer of suitable work without good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.442" offset="722726">It's almost the exact language of the statute in Thomas.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="148.262" offset="737982">Mr. French, I'm afraid we're going to have a very disappointing argument here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.881" offset="756476">As I read the briefs, I'm not sure your opponent wants to argue about the question as you so well expressed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.654" offset="783539">You did, indeed, express the question that was presented in the petition for cert at the outset of your brief, whether you have to be a member of an organized religion in order to claim the benefit of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.295" offset="834112">But as I understand the position being... being taken here by... by the Appellees, they concede that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.318" offset="866191">And all they want to argue about is whether... whether, indeed, your client adequately established the sincerity of his religious conviction as opposed to whether it was part of an organized religion or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_french" startTime="194.208" stopTime="227.012">
            <label>Mr. David A. French</label>
            <text syncTime="194.208" offset="921779">That's correct, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.910" offset="924600">I would make two points in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.560" offset="931183">First of all, this was the first time the Department has raised this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.212" offset="945812">Throughout the lower court proceedings, they urged the lower courts to take the position that the Illinois appellate court ultimately took, first of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.068" offset="981234">And secondly, I would say... and I'd like to address this more completely as I get into the argument, but for now I would say that their position both mischaracterizes the record in this case and confuses the issues of the fact and law that are before this Court for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.645" offset="1039539">But that's the short answer to your question, and I would like to explore it more fully.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="227.012" stopTime="238.187">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="227.012" offset="1053018">I would hate to think we took this case just... just to decide whether... whether your client proved with adequate... with adequate force the sincerity of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.737" offset="1091889">That's really not the kind of--</text>

            <text syncTime="238.187" offset="1097740">Well--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="238.704" stopTime="239.537">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="238.704" offset="1099725">--we usually take up here, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_french" startTime="239.537" stopTime="405.178">
            <label>Mr. David A. French</label>
            <text syncTime="239.537" offset="1103069">--That's right, but I would say that, first of all, there's... and I'll reach that directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.191" offset="1129714">The fact of the matter is that... that this Court would not have to overturn any factual determination that was made by the administrative agency in order to overturn the... the decision of the Illinois appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.314" offset="1170256">The courts... the agency and the... the Illinois appellate court both made clear that Mr. Frazee's belief were... beliefs were religious in nature and that they were sincere.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.771" offset="1208081">And I will demonstrate that as we proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.223" offset="1221874">And that gets directly to the point that throughout the administrative proceedings, Mr. Frazee's sincerity was never questioned in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.031" offset="1265028">The first person that he presented his claim to under... under the statute was the claims adjudicator, and that claims adjudicator made this express finding that was the determination he was required to make under the Illinois statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.387" offset="1310481">"On April 30, 1984, the claimant refused an offer of work with Kelly Services, Incorporated, because he did not want to work on Sunday due to his religious conviction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="301.944" offset="1352695">The claims adjudicator didn't have any problem identifying Mr. Frazee's beliefs as being religiously based.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.764" offset="1375996">And when Mr. Frazee's claim was rejected by the claims adjudicator, he appealed to the referee and had a hearing before the referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.752" offset="1404000">The referee affirmed the decision of the claims adjudicator on all issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.572" offset="1423226">And at that hearing Mr. Frazee responded to the questions of the referee without benefit of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.393" offset="1446527">Now, the transcript will show that the referee wasn't concerned about Mr. Frazee's sincerity at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.095" offset="1469306">He was only concerned about two issues: first, whether Mr. Frazee was a member of an established religious organization; and secondly, whether he was exercising the beliefs of an established religious organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.319" offset="1510266">That was the entire focus of the referee's questioning during the hearing about Mr. Frazee's religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.472" offset="1534821">When that was... when the... or excuse me... when the referee upheld the decision of the claims adjudicator, Mr. Frazee appealed to the Board of Review, and once again his sincerity was not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.816" offset="1592186">The board specifically ruled that Mr. Frazee's beliefs were not protected no matter how strong or sincerely held.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.970" offset="1620816">And I'd emphasize here that what the board had in front of it at the time it made its determination was more than just the testimony that Mr. Frazee presented at the... at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.361" offset="1662403">It had two written statements that Mr. Frazee presented during the course of the administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.932" offset="1684659">And contrary to the claims of the Department here, what that evidence showed is a lot more than Mr. Frazee just saying I'm a Christian and... and I can't work on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.018" offset="1717051">In fact, the two written statements showed that his beliefs were derived from his own personal reading of the Bible, relying first on the Commandments contained in the Decalogue and secondly on the actions of Christ in the New Testament.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.309" offset="1762191">There is no--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="405.178" stopTime="417.919">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="405.178" offset="1765639">But, Mr. French, it... it is true that the Board of Review ended up its opinion saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="413.165" offset="1797613">"however, other than his own self-serving testimony, the claimant has presented no corroborative evidence to establish that working on a Sunday was unsuitable for him. "</text>

          <turn speaker="david_a_french" startTime="417.919" stopTime="523.172">
            <label>Mr. David A. French</label>
            <text syncTime="417.919" offset="1816630">--That's correct, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.169" offset="1821645">And actually that's kind of a puzzling statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.605" offset="1835333">Until... I think when you read it in context, what it's referring to when they're saying there he didn't produce any evidence corroborating his beliefs, it's referring... the corroboration that they were asking for and were looking for was that... the corroboration of the... of a established religious organization that that tenet was found in an established organization didn't refer specifically to the evidence he was presenting in my... in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.005" offset="1940973">I think that's the fair reading of... of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.874" offset="1948496">Or, otherwise, if in fact that was the basis of the board's decision, there would have been no need for the board to... to say whatsoever that in order to... for a claimant to get the protection of the First Amendment, that you have to show that you're a member of... of a denomination or church organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.851" offset="2016310">And they made that ruling specifically and expressly that when a refusal to work is based on religious convictions, it must be based solely on the fact that the person is exercising the beliefs of an established religious organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.845" offset="2072316">So, I think when... when read properly in context, what that statement by the board is referring to is the fact that Mr. Frazee didn't establish that he was exercising the belief of an established religious organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.153" offset="2121531">But this was the evidence, the evidence that I've mentioned, the evidence contained in the transcript and the two written statements of Mr. Frazee is what the board had in front of it when it passed on Mr. Frazee's beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.461" offset="2170746">And certainly the Board of Review didn't have any problem identifying the religious basis of Mr. Frazee's beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.447" offset="2194778">It termed them "religious convictions".</text>
            <text syncTime="513.964" offset="2200839">The sole ground for denial, as I mentioned, was that Mr. Frazee did not show that he was exercising a belief of an established religious organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.096" offset="2293312">Justice Scalia... excuse me... I'd like to just respond a little more fully to your question about what the issue in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.002" offset="2324973">I'm not so sure that the Department here has conceded for the purpose of this oral argument that the position of the Illinois appellate court was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.239" offset="2349946">In their motion to dismiss and... dismiss or affirm, the Department took the position on the question presented as follows: whether a state agency violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by denying an... an individual unemployment benefits due to his refusal to work on a Sunday when that refusal is not based upon any specific religious or church tenet, but rather upon his allegation of a personal feeling that as a Christian it was wrong for him to work on Sundays.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.561" offset="2475229">Now, the first time that the... the Department had changed the focus of its argument at all in this case was after we submitted our brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.649" offset="2511591">But I'm not so sure even in their brief on the merits that they've taken the position that the... that they've conceded that the test adopted by the Illinois appellate court is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.720" offset="2543879">On page 20 of their brief they say,</text>
            <text syncTime="602.957" offset="2556731">"Congress cannot know and the courts cannot measure a statute's impact on religion unless the salient points of the religion are objectively measurable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="610.611" offset="2587346">"The need to identify some tangible evidence of a religion and its beliefs leads both courts and legislative bodies into invoking "dogma and tenets" as a shorthand way to measure the breadth and scope of religious beliefs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="623.871" offset="2640427">I'd like to know myself from the Department whether they are defending, in fact, the test adopted by the Illinois and if so, what the... what the basis of that is because I don't think it's contained in their brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.558" offset="3311147">Now, just getting back briefly to what transpired in this case, as I mentioned, the Board of Review did, in fact, pass on a broad range of evidence that was before it, not just the transcript that was presented by Mr. Frazee.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.568" offset="3379170">They had the two statements and on the basis of that testimony, determined that his belief was not protected because he was not exercising a belief or tenet of a... of a church or denomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.911" offset="3428594">That was the sole ground given for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.780" offset="3440088">When Mr. Frazee... when that decision was given, he filed a complaint then for administrative review in the Illinois circuit court and that court affirmed the decision of the Board of Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.885" offset="3480525">Mr. Frazee then appealed to the Illinois appellate court and once again, that court had no problem determining either the sincerity of Mr. Frazee's belief or the religious nature of that belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.324" offset="3522217">First of all, the court specifically stated:</text>
            <text syncTime="846.526" offset="3531098">"We do not question the sincerity of plaintiff. "</text>
            <text syncTime="849.442" offset="3542697">Secondly, the court also discussed in detail the historic Christian practice against Sunday labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.298" offset="3570178">So, there's no question they were understanding that this was a... a belief based on religious conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.869" offset="3592434">And, in fact, they termed Mr. Frazee's belief a personal professed religious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.355" offset="3614377">The sole ground for the rejection of Mr. Frazee's claim that the Illinois appellate court gave was that that court believed that the Constitution extended protection to individuals only, number one, when they're a member of an established religious organization and, number two, when they're exercising a tenet of that organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.234" offset="3693893">That was the sole ground given by that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.869" offset="3700476">Now, it must be emphasized that the Illinois court's understanding of the scope of the Free Exercise Clause is not isolated.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.590" offset="3731301">Recently four state courts in Vermont, New Jersey, Arkansas and Indiana have rejected Free Exercise Clause claims on very similar grounds to that advanced by the Illinois appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.831" offset="3776231">But that court's understanding of the scope of the Free Exercise Clause is inconsistent with important principles of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.586" offset="3803294">Firstly, on its face, the test grants an unconstitutional preference to established religious organizations and disadvantages religious dissenters and adherence of emerging new sects.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.061" offset="3857211">The court's test by its own terms makes protection for individual belief dependent on the acceptance of that belief by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.267" offset="3893991">That's precisely what this Court said in Thomas the Free Exercise Clause did not require.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.154" offset="3913531">In addition, that... the test would operate to create a de facto preference to certain religions that are highly organized in credo.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.224" offset="3941848">For instance, a Buddhist or a Hindu would not qualify for protection under this test no matter what their beliefs they advance because neither Buddhism nor Hinduism, as a matter of fact, maintain a uniform body or practices of beliefs... a uniform body of practices or beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.453" offset="4014782">So, none of those claim... adherence to those religions would qualify for protection under this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.542" offset="4039128">In addition, the test requires the court to scrutinize both the individual religious belief and compare it to the tenets of an established religious organization, and that would involve courts in questions of religious doctrine which is what the... what the First Amendment also does not permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.586" offset="4111330">The test by its own terms requires courts to determine who members of established religious sects are and also what is the relevant established religious organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.276" offset="4154066">Both of those questions often involve issues of religious doctrine and would present the problem of excessive... courts' excessive entanglement in religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.000" offset="4192937">It appears that the Illinois appellate court believed that Sherbert, Thomas and Hobble required that an individual be a member of an established sect in order to obtain the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.558" offset="4243196">But that goes far beyond what this Court's holdings in... in those cases and other cases have required for a belief to qualify for protection under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.096" offset="4285306">Instead of requiring an individual to be a member of such a sect, what this Court has said in those cases is the only thing is required that the individual have an honest conviction that the work is forbidden by his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.302" offset="4330132">So, in short, we have two requirements: first, that the belief is sincerely held by the individual and, secondly, that the belief must be rooted in religion as opposed to purely philosophical or secular concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.287" offset="12206050">I think that would be a... an appropriate holding if the Court so wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.906" offset="12224545">We would suggest that applying several of the tests that this Court and other courts have used to determine the presence or the existence of a religious belief, that it can be determined that in this particular set of facts, Mr. Frazee did not raise claim that implicates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.223" offset="12321825">If the belief must be stated in a manner that can be objectively understood to be religious, what we have in this instance is Mr. Frazee claiming a mantle of Christianity and simply saying that he expects the finder of fact to make a determination that the certain body of beliefs associated with that and that his sincerity as to those beliefs should go unquestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.791" offset="12428091">It's incumbent upon the fact finder in that instance to be presumed to have a certain body of knowledge as to what all of the... the rights, responsibilities and duties of an adherent to Christianity are and, number one, what this particular individual holds as his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.156" offset="12525580">Secondly, that the belief must be relevant to the purpose that it is invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.108" offset="12545433">All that we would suggest is that one recognizes that there are a variety of beliefs that may be suggested under the term "Christianity".</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.499" offset="12586915">Not all sects to Christianity hold the sabbath or the Sunday sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.070" offset="12605201">We must look to see whether or not this particular individual claims to have that as his important tenet of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.342" offset="12642295">Thirdly, and this is in response perhaps to something raised earlier, that if you don't have something that is identifiable as a religious organization familiar to the Judeo-Christian ethic, that you look at what place this body of beliefs holds in the life of this individual, whether it occupies a place that would be similar to the belief in God in someone else, and make a determination that there is a religious belief even though it does not look like the familiar religions that we may be accustomed to seeing, thereby allowing minority religions to have the same evenhanded treatment as majority religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.853" offset="12816375">If the Free Exercise Clause is to be preserved, then one must accept the notion that it is not self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.310" offset="12854200">Those seeking free exercise protection are not burdened, nor their rights diminished if they are asked that they assert those rights in terms that are sufficiently clear and in a context consistent with their established purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.653" offset="12915536">What Frazee would like the fact finder to do in this instance on the basis of an insufficient record is to infer facts, assume beliefs and then apply his subjective understanding to the terms "I am a Christian".</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.128" offset="12969453">This result should be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.346" offset="12982305">To do so would mean that it would deprive individuals who are entitled to First Amendment protection of that protection and wrongfully bestow it on others who would not qualify for it.</text>
