            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="62.240" offset="384434">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the State of Iowa may tax the income earned by Shell Oil Company in the extraction of oil and gas from the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.398" offset="437097">Simply stated, Iowa requires Shell to take its OCS earnings into account in figuring out its Iowa income tax liability, with the result being that the more money Shell earns on the outer continental shelf, the more Iowa income tax it generally pays.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.860" offset="506896">It's our position that State taxation of this sort is prohibited by the language, the legislative history, and the purposes and policies of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which demonstrate, we believe, that Congress meant to prohibit the States from taxing any portion of OCS revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="576381">Iowa, on the other hand, contends that the Act contains an implied exception for apportioned income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.875" offset="603026">Let me begin by briefly explaining the background of this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.362" offset="620894">Shell engages in substantial exploration for oil and gas on the outer continental shelf, pursuant to Federal leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.533" offset="649629">Now, it's relatively easy for Shell to figure out its net income from these OCS operations, because the oil and gas has a definite and easily ascertainable fair market value at the wellhead, and Shell also knows what its expenses are in extracting the oil and gas from the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.227" offset="716398">In fact, Shell has to figure out, make these precise calculations for a number of Federal purposes, such as the windfall profits tax, the oil depletion allowances, and most importantly, in figuring out the amount it owes to the Federal Government as royalties on these Federal leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.487" offset="773449">Now, Shell also does business in Iowa, and as a result, it's subject to Iowa's corporate income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.474" offset="797377">Now, Iowa, like virtually every State, determines the Income tax liability for a multi-state business through use of a formula apportionment method.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.580" offset="837815">It starts with the corporation's Federal income tax base, its net income for Federal income tax purposes, and it then subtracts from that Federal income tax amounts that it either can't Constitutionally tax, such as items that may not be part of the unitary business, or items that Congress by statute has prohibited it from taxing, such as, for example, the interest on Federal securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.647" offset="942096">Now, what is left then is the Iowa income tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.699" offset="958292">Then multiplies that by a percentage... in most States, that percentage is based on three factors of payroll, property and sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.455" offset="993296">As the Court is aware from its decision in Poorman, Iowa uses a one factor sales formula with the numerator being sales in Iowa, and the denominator being sales everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.929" offset="1043242">Then multiplies that Iowa income base by this fraction, and it comes up with the corporation's Iowa taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.202" offset="1072290">Now, when Shell computed its Iowa income for the years in question, it subtracted from its Federal income base the amounts it earned from the extraction of oil and gas from the outer continental shelf, and it did that based on the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which provide</text>
            <text syncTime="253.264" offset="1148568">"State taxation laws shall not apply to the outer continental shelf. "</text>
            <text syncTime="257.901" offset="1167062">And as the Court will know from the table reproduced at footnote seven at page 10 of our brief, when Shell's OCS income was not subjected to the provisions of Iowa's income tax laws, it made a substantial difference in Shell's Iowa income tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.147" offset="1248042">Now, the State challenged the way in which--</text>

            <text syncTime="537.914" offset="2287193">We believe that this conclusion follows from three crucial pieces of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.235" offset="2312479">And the first, of course, is the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.687" offset="2326272">And As I mentioned a moment ago, Section 1333(a)(2) of Title 43 provides... and I quote...</text>

            <text syncTime="558.661" offset="2370158">And this language is reinforced by section 1333(a)(3) of the statute, which states that subsection (a)(2), which I just read to you, shall never be interpreted in such a way as to allow the States to claim any share of the revenues from OCS mineral production.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.206" offset="2444346">But that of course is precisely what Iowa is trying to do here by insisting that Shell include its OCS earning in its Iowa income base.</text>

            <text syncTime="638.010" offset="2687493">The first, as I was just referring to, is the language of the statute, which is categorical.</text>

            <text syncTime="699.596" offset="2933880">Decisions of this Court between 1947 and 1950 had held that the OCS was in fact not State land, but exclusively Federal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.184" offset="2968257">And Therefore, much of the debates in the legislative history were attempts by the coastal States to reassert the jurisdiction that they had previously exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.826" offset="3010785">But every one of those attempts was beaten back.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.211" offset="3020293">And of course, if we are right that Congress comprehensively prohibited the States from imposing any income tax, any tax whatsoever, including income tax, then of course it serves to reason that that prohibition would apply to all States, and not just the coastal States.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.204" offset="3608257">But there are two things to be said about that, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.906" offset="3619124">The first is that the statue doesn't say</text>
            <text syncTime="873.358" offset="3628946">"State taxation laws shall not apply on the outer continental shelf. "</text>
            <text syncTime="877.560" offset="3645769">it says</text>
            <text syncTime="878.143" offset="3648068">"State taxation laws shall not apply to the outer continental shelf. "</text>
            <text syncTime="881.195" offset="3660293">It seems to us that what Congress was getting at is that they didn't want the States to tax any activities that occurred on the outer continental shelf, and in any meaningful sense of the term, it seems to us, Congress meant to say that if profits were made on the outer continental... after all, let me answer it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.926" offset="3735212">Congress knew that profits were going... at least hoped... profits were going to be made on the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.228" offset="3756424">That's how it attempted to encourage companies to go out and develop the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.197" offset="3776277">Now, it's crystal clear from the legislative history... and Iowa doesn't dispute this... that Congress sale, we do not want the States to grab any share of those profits, through a severance tax, through a sales tax, through an excise tax, through a property tax or even through an unapportioned income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.493" offset="3845449">So the question really becomes why would Congress have meant to make an exception for apportioned income taxes, if the result of allowing the States to impose apportioned income taxes would be the same as allowing them to impose these other types of taxes, which is to make operations on the shelf less profitable, which they clearly do.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.406" offset="3925070">It's undisputed in this case, as the figures I referred to earlier suggest, that the more profit that a company makes on the outer continental shelf, the more State tax it has to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.262" offset="3968538">Therefore, operations on the outer continental shelf are less profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.249" offset="3984525">If they're less profitable because the States impose a severance tax, or an excise tax, or a sales tax, Congress said they can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.986" offset="4015454">The question remains, given the policies of the Act, which were to encourage development on the shelf, by in fact immunizing the income earned out there, and to maximize Federal revenues, why would Congress have meant to exclude this one type of taxation, apportioned income taxation, from the universe of taxes that they meant to prohibit the States from enforcing as to OCS revenues?</text>
            <text syncTime="993.601" offset="4109913">Now, Iowa never explains why.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.320" offset="4120780">It never explains why its theory is consistent with the categorical language of the statute, which says State taxation laws shall not apply to the outer continental shelf--</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.299" offset="4936636">We have to look at what Congress meant to do in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.584" offset="4945831">This section 1331(a)(3) is quite clear as to the extent of the immunity that Congress meant to grant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.405" offset="4973103">And what they said is that the States are not to claim any interest in any revenues from the natural resources from the shelf.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.700" offset="5042275">Now, Congress did not say... and it wouldn't have been consistent with what it was trying to do here... that this oil and gas would be given an immunity as it went through life, if it was turned into some other product, like petroleum, and it was subject to some transaction in some State, and the transaction tax was generally imposed in that State, it would make no sense, given the purposes here, to carry the immunity that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.962" offset="5331294">But what Congress had in mind is that the increment of income earned from the extraction of oil and gas on the shelf... which is easily determinable, and it all accrues on the shelf itself... is what is not to be included in the State income tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.436" offset="5381240">All of that income is earned on an exclusively Federal enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.388" offset="5393048">It's not a transaction tax such as you're referring to now, which the States generally can tax because it occurs within their jurisdiction and they generally tax transactions of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.910" offset="5427111">We're dealing with something quite different here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.193" offset="5436306">Now, Iowa's position, as I believe Justice O'Connor referred to earlier, is to suggest that the statute only involves jurisdiction-based taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.885" offset="5483013">Now, there are a number of problems, we think, with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.055" offset="5499732">The first, of course, is that it render the statute largely superfluous and redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.126" offset="5523973">After all, there would have been no reason to pass a statute to prevent the States from imposing jurisdiction-based taxes on the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.263" offset="5552499">This Court had held in a series of cases between 1947 and 1950 that the OCS was an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.702" offset="5590324">Therefore, the Due Process clause and the Commerce clause already prevented the States from imposing any jurisdiction-based taxes on the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.391" offset="5625015">So there really wouldn't have been any reason, if that had been Congress' intention, to pass a separate, two separate statutory provisions providing that the States could not impose jurisdiction based taxes on the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.084" offset="5683843">The second point that Iowa makes is, as I said earlier, a bit of a linguistic point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.090" offset="5711846">They suggest that even if Section 1333(a)(2) means what it seems to say, which is that State taxation laws shall not apply to the outer continental shelf, that they are not really "applying" their State taxation laws to the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.218" offset="5780391">And for this, they rely, as I said earlier, on a series of decisions from this Court involving Constitutional or Due Process objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.705" offset="5810275">Now it's true that this Court has said in a number of cases that apportioned taxation generally doesn't violate the due process clause, because it's really meant only to measure in-State taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.530" offset="5861580">There's no sort of extraterritorial taxation going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.917" offset="5875163">And we don't challenge Iowa's right to tax OCS revenues under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.286" offset="5896584">We think Congress meant something more than that when it passed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.106" offset="5915915">We think that Congress didn't have to be satisfied with the "rough approximations" that occur under the Due Process laws when apportioned State income taxation is attacked as violating rules against extraterritorial taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.568" offset="5985714">Congress had something more in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.968" offset="5991356">We believe it could require, and in our view it plainly did require, more precision than the Constitution requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.440" offset="6021240">It required that the States not include any OCS values in figuring out their State income taxes, just as, for example, Congress in passing Section 3124(a) of Title 31 prohibited the States from including any income earned from Federal securities in the income base subject to State taxation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry M. Griger</label>
            <text syncTime="1717.778" offset="7006579">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, my argument discusses three points as to why Iowa's apportioned tax is not in conflict with the Cuter Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.007" offset="7071467">First, absent extraterritorial taxation that violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process clause, or the Commerce clause, State unitary apportioned taxation is not the exercise of State political jurisdiction outside the taxing State, but only inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.503" offset="7157462">Second, 43 U.S.C. Section 1331(a) which is found on pages 94(a) to 95(a) of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement precludes State political jurisdiction in the outer continental shelf by a taxing State, but not inside the taxing State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.505" offset="7257459">And third, the 1978 Outer Continental Shelf Amendments are inapplicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.558" offset="7289746">With respect to my first point, the unitary business formal apportionment method is a method for division of multi-state unitary income within and without the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.901" offset="7339066">It is designed to tax that income which is reasonably attributable to the taxing State as a result of the taxpayers' activities that occur there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.090" offset="7379817">Unlike separate accounting, it recognizes that there are unquantifiable factors of profitability which arise from the unitary business as a whole, rather than from merely any particular segment, and that these factors of profitability contribute as a whole to the earnings of the entire unitary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.705" offset="7478350">Its design is to value the income-producing activities in the taxing State, not outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.811" offset="7506772">My second point is with respect to section 1333, subparagraph (a), which obviously is a key statute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.251" offset="7548463">We contend that the statute precludes State political jurisdiction over the shelf, but not off the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.873" offset="7582945">Section 1333(a), subparagraph (1) provides for exclusive Federal jurisdiction on the outer continental shelf, but such language does not preclude reasonable apportionment income attribution to the taxing State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.568" offset="7649714">The second subsection, which is subsection (a), sub (2), sub (A), provides that applicable and not inconsistent adjacent State law is adopted as surrogate Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.594" offset="7713870">Within the context of that paragraph that says that, the last sentence states that State taxation laws shall not apply to the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.319" offset="7756711">Now, one who reads that for the first time could understandably get the impression that that simply means that adjacent State tax laws shall not be adopted as surrogate Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.013" offset="7823585">However, one could also read the language to confirm that there is no State political jurisdiction to be exercised in the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.886" offset="7867052">The language does not preclude a State from exercising its taxing jurisdiction off the shelf, which has occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.177" offset="7908221">The legislative history with respect to this taxation language denotes that there was a battle in the Congress between proponents, primarily from Louisiana and from Texas who wanted to extend their territorial jurisdiction to the outer continental shelf to impose primarily their severance taxes there, and opponents of State taxation who resisted such extension as unconstitutional extraterritorial taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.415" offset="8045103">Senator Cordon in explaining the conference bill to the Senate, stated that the language [inaudible] State taxation laws do not apply to the outer continental shelf really added nothing to the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.055" offset="8099751">It was already covered in other provisions of the statute with respect to absence of State political jurisdiction on the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.880" offset="8146981">Indeed, this Court in the Gulf Offshore case stated with respect to the third subsection here, section 1333(a)(3), that provides that nothing in the prior subsection, which provides for adoption of adjacent State law as Federal law, can be used by a State to exercise jurisdiction over the outer continental shelf of itself precluded any State taxation laws from being extended to the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.869" offset="8286997">Therefore, the language</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.773" offset="8306537">really added nothing to the bill, but according to Senator Cordon, was insisted by the House conferees out of a superabundance of caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.546" offset="8341645">And my third point is that the 1978 Cuter Continental Shelf Act Amendments are simply inapplicable to the issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.427" offset="9261155">As a matter of fact, Mr. Geller has conceded, in page 6 of his reply brief, that Iowa could impose such a property tax in Iowa, impose that on outer continental shelf oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.319" offset="9316744">The concepts are no different, because the problem is, you have a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.238" offset="9340463">And because it's a unitary business, formula apportionment is generally an acceptable way of attributing the income within the State, recognizing that activities from the entire business contribute to the earning of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.232" offset="9400440">But what we are trying to do is simply attribute income in reasonable proportions to Shell's activities in Iowa, and as Mr. Geller has stated, they don't contend that we've done otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.123" offset="9439937">My third point is with respect to the 1978 OCS amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.194" offset="9464283">Those amendments were designed to procure a fair return to the Federal Government while at the same time be fair to oil producers in increasing funds for exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.965" offset="9503363">Now, the problem that these amendments were dealing with was the cash bonus, fixed royalty method of leasing in the outer continental shelf by the Federal Government with huge front-end payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.159" offset="9568146">These payments were so large that they literally kept down competition in the shelf for lease bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.581" offset="9601792">Only a few of the major oil companies could afford the bids, and indeed, the legislative history shows at the Senate hearings they complained... even some of the majors complained, such as Humble, Standard Oil... complained that the amounts that they had to pay in terms of the front-end costs were very high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.696" offset="9694266">It also led to low bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.362" offset="9704923">There was an example in the legislative history where one company bid $144,000 for a tract that had a potential value of $20 million,--</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.301" offset="9748705">Finally, it kept small producers off the shelf entirely, because they couldn't afford the huge, front-end bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.407" offset="9781097">The Congressional response to that was to amend section 1337 to provide for alternative bidding, which is discussed by this Court in the watt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.833" offset="9834804">Now note that State taxes were never mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.785" offset="9846612">They're not mentioned in the statute, the 1978 amendments, they're not mentioned in the legislative history, and OCS producers at this time had been paying apportioned State taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.193" offset="9904290">In fact, Shell had, as denoted on page 47 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.597" offset="9933861">Therefore, in conclusion, Shell's challenge to the makeup of the unitary net income base subject to apportionment as in conflict with the Cuter Continental Shelf Lands Act should be rejected, and the decision of the Iowa Supreme Court should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.737" offset="10098432">In our view, the fundamental and dispositive flaw in Petitioner's claim is that it is based and was based in the State courts solely on a Federal statute that does not address, and was not intended to address, the subject matter of Petitioner's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.186" offset="10196235">Certainly none of the statutory language on which Petitioner relies in terms speaks to the question of apportionment methods in the State taxation of the in-state income of a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.433" offset="10273243">We may assume, for purposes of this case, that the language that Congress enacted would suffice, and this is questionable, but we may assume it would suffice, to have some effect on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.711" offset="10342311">If the legislative history clearly showed that that was what Congress intended... but the conspicuous thins about the legislative history, for our purposes, is that no one discussed or even adverted to the question of apportionment methods in determining the amount of a unitary business' income that is properly attributable to its in-state activities for State income taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.628" offset="10657975">Yes, but this Court's decisions dealing with the subject of unitary taxation are all premised on the notion that the taxes are not being applied extraterritorially, to something outside the States's borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.505" offset="10737492">It is just a method of more accurately determining how much of a unitary business' income is properly attributable to its in-state activities, because of what the Court has called the theoretical weaknesses of separate geographical accounting in trying to apportion the income of a unitary business, where it would be subject to imprecisions and manipulation... these are words that the Court has used... were it not considered as a unit and apportioned according to the common apportioned formula methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.166" offset="10896107">Now, that is a subject that has occupied tens of pages in the United States Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.070" offset="10919722">It's a subject of some complexity, and no one discussed it in the course of the legislative history of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.307" offset="10952741">Instead, the entire controversy in the evolution and enactment of the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, that are at Issue here, concern the question of the proper relation between Federal law and the law of the immediately adjacent State in territorial governance of the outer continental shelf, a question to which Congress turned in the wake of this Court's decisions, holding that that was Federal, rather than State, territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.563" offset="11089727">And with respect to the particular subject of income taxation, the controversy before Congress never extended beyond the question whether the adjacent State should be allowed to tax income from activities on the outer continental shelf as if those activities had occurred within the State itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.428" offset="11185230">That is not what Iowa has done, and is not the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.630" offset="11206024">And, I specifically include the one snippet of the legislative history that Shell particularly relies on... Senator Long's statement on the Floor... and I'm perfectly willing to look at it as quoted in the Appellant's blue brief, on the merits, page 31, at the bottom of the page of text.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.298" offset="11312708">Senator Long... this is the fourth line from the bottom of that page... Senator Long recognized that OCS lessees would be</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.361" offset="11392956">For all that appears, all he was referring to were three categories of tax that proponents of alternative bills wanted the adjacent State to be able to apply directly to the outer continental shelf, as if that were part of their territory, as many States had treated it prior to this Court's decisions holding it to be Federal territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.929" offset="11491177">That was what the controversy was about... whether they should be allowed to exercise taxing jurisdiction over this territory by grant of that authority by Congress, whether the effect on the State power to tax that followed from this Court's decisions would be overruled by legislation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2869.528" offset="11613639">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.630" offset="11621998">But in context, there's nothing to indicate that Senator Long was talking about anything other than a tax being imposed by the adjacent State, either a severance tax, a property tax, or an income tax, on the activities on the shelf, as if those were still to be considered part of the State's territory, subject to the State's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.066" offset="11735787">So, our conclusion is that the Iowa Supreme Court correctly held that the Federal statute does not address the apportionment issue that was before that court, and that that issue therefore continues to be governed only by this Court's decisions under the Due Process and Commerce clauses, and by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.716" offset="11842367">And I might say, about State law, that many of the States, including Iowa and Florida, whose case is being held for this one, in applying their apportionment formulas start, in basing the total income subject to the formula, with Federal taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.266" offset="11940587">And that, we know from the Internal Revenue Service, includes income derived from all portions of United States territory, including Federal enclaves within the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.627" offset="12018014">If oil is produced on an Indian reservation or a Federal petroleum reserve, all of that would normally be included in the apportionment formula, and income derived from operations on the outer continental shelf would ordinarily be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.589" offset="12085828">So, this statute, in our view, does not address that question, and since no Constitutional claim has been raised, the judgement of the Supreme Court of Iowa should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3004.984" offset="12155418">Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.668" offset="12166181">First, I'd like to address the statement that Justice Scalia made earlier about the possible interpretation of the phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.072" offset="12191781">"State taxation laws shall not apply to the outer continental shelf. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.691" offset="12202230">Justice Scalia suggested that maybe that was simply meant to exclude State tax laws from the State laws that were being adopted as Federal law, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.147" offset="12240055">But I think that that makes absolutely no sense, when you look at the legislative debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.199" offset="12256251">The whole purpose of the debates was over whether the States would be able to share in any OCS revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.753" offset="12278507">That's crystal clear, that this was intended to be a restriction on the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.871" offset="12290941">But if State tax laws had been adopted as Federal law, under the first part of Section 1333(a)(2), then the revenues from those State taxes would have gone to the Federal Government, not to the States, and those State taxes would have been administered by the Federal Government, not by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.297" offset="12356666">So therefore, I think that reading of the State tax prohibition would make it a restriction on the powers of the Federal Government, not on the powers of the States, which makes very little sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.872" offset="12395013">Congress must have had something more in mind than not adopting State tax laws as Federal law, I believe, when it passed the State tax prohibition in section 1333(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.128" offset="12432003">Now, I didn't hear anything in Iowa's statements here today, or either from the Solicitor General, explaining why it would make any sense, given the policies and purposes of the Act, to allow the States to diminish OCS profits through this one form of State taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.387" offset="12493025">They have some arguments about there being nothing on the face of the statute about apportionment methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.041" offset="12511624">Of course there's nothing on the face of the statute that talks about property taxes or severance taxes either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.343" offset="12532835">As Justice O'Connor said, Congress spoke quite categorically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.628" offset="12546001">It said State taxation laws as a group.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.438" offset="12613188">We have said... I think I said earlier in response to Justice Scalia's question, transaction-based taxes of this sort, that are imposed well after any profits are earned on the OCS, are not within the intent of Congress in passing this immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.313" offset="12664701">We don't suggest the statute goes that far.</text>
