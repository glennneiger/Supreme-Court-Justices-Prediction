            <text syncTime="10.879" offset="192732">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.561" offset="211435">This case is before the Court on appeal from a final judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.344" offset="234632">Appellants, as certified by the courts below, are a class comprising all registered voters of the State of Missouri who do not also own real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.101" offset="265666">At issue is Section 30 of Article VI of the Constitution of the State of Missouri, a provision authorizing the creation and operation of a Board of Freeholders, which is an ad hoc, tax-supported, public governmental body authorized the exclusive authority to prepare and submit to the electorate of the St. Louis Metropolitan Area a plan for local government reorganization including the partial or complete government of all or any part of the City of St. Louis and St. Louis County.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.010" offset="381231">The case was originally submitted on cross-motions for summary judgment and stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.143" offset="405786">The challenge to the Section 30, both on its face and as applied, in the instance of the creation of the present Board of Freeholders in this area, was overruled by the Missouri Supreme Court on the grounds that the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment are irrelevant to the discrimination suffered by the appellant class because, in the court's words, the Board of Freeholders fails to exercise "general governmental power".</text>
            <text syncTime="89.440" offset="506933">The question thus presented in the Court this afternoon is whether the State of Missouri may, by the operation of its State Constitution and the activities of appointing authorities operating under that provision, extend to one class of citizens... to wit, property owners, the owners of real property... the opportunity for public service and participation in a critical aspect of state and local governmental operation and, at the same time, withhold an equivalent opportunity for service and participation to the members of the appellant class solely because the appellants do not own an interest in real property.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.480" offset="1399171">Well, but there are two quite different lines of reasoning I would have thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.484" offset="1415158">One is what you said earlier, the right to serve in a governmental capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.228" offset="1434175">And the other is the right to vote on matters that have a good deal of concern to you.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.572" offset="1459462">Your Honor, first of all, the subsequent opportunity to vote does not overcome the discrimination which occurs when the Board is first put into place.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.539" offset="1503347">That is the act of discrimination.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="340.699" offset="1512020">Well, it may not overcome the discrimination insofar as the opportunity to serve is concerned, but it very likely would overcome any discrimination insofar as the adoption of the plan is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.858" offset="1560608">If all the voters have a right to vote, it's hard to see they are discriminated against as voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.084" offset="1581506">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the reasoning articulated by this Court in Bullock and Lubin which concerned candidate restrictions, qualifications restricting candidates seeking an access to the ballot in a primary election, recognized that when an identifiable segment of the voting public has their perspective artificially barred from the ballot, that they suffer a diminution of the right of franchise and suffer an abridgement of their right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.920" offset="1692892">The concomitant effect of an exclusion of a segment of society from one level of participation has an impact on the exercise of the right to vote, and that it is this exercise which in fact elevates the concern in the constitutional failure of Section 30, that those who do not own real property are allowed to participate only at the back end of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.637" offset="1791739">They may be naysayers, they may be able to vote down a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.669" offset="1803860">And if they do, and if they, along with the rest of society, still seek to improve the operations of their government, they can only do so if another Board of Freeholders would propose a plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.296" offset="5130397">And when... as in the cases of Bullock v. Carter and Lubin v. Panish... candidates seeking nearly access to the ballot for a primary election, never to exercise any "general governmental power" or any power whatsoever, other than the opportunity to stand again for election, when this Court has considered restrictions which impede the opportunity of citizens to seek access to the ballot, you have found... and I think quite appropriately... that no such standard can survive constitutional scrutiny absent it being reasonably necessary, and, therefore, surviving a heightened level of constitutional scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.280" offset="5274384">There is no difference between the opportunity for service on the Board of Freeholders so that you can dictate access to the ballot for the proposition, and the opportunity for service... opportunity to stand for election in the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.191" offset="5321927">I think that that factor also would indicate that the standard to be applied should be heightened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.832" offset="5440523">The state, perhaps not surprisingly, has a slightly different perspective on this case than that enunciated by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.988" offset="5469153">What's important to remember is that 65 years ago the people of the state, that is, the whole State of Missouri, decided that there might come a time when the people of St. Louis City and County would want to reorganize the metropolitan government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.178" offset="5529966">To that end, the people of the state invoked the state initiative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.459" offset="5546998">They passed petitions throughout the state, gathered signatures from every congressional district in the state, and voted to adopt a process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.907" offset="5588794">This was the only thing on the ballot... or, pardon me... it wasn't like adopting a constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.371" offset="5606662">It was one issue and the people of the state voted to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.034" offset="5621395">They voted to adopt a process whereby the Mayor of St. Louis City, the County Executive of St. Louis County, and the Governor, each appointed a number of people to a board, a committee, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.694" offset="5680013">In this case it was called the Board of Freeholders, and this group of people have exactly one function, and that is to propose a plan for the reorganization of Metropolitan St. Louis government.</text>
