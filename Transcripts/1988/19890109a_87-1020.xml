            <text syncTime="129.266" offset="649576">After the decision of this Court in Memphis Bank &amp; Trust Company v. Garner, which was in 1983, Appellant filed amended returns for several years, starting in the year... tax year starting in 1979 and sought refunds of the income taxes which he had paid on his federal retirement benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.754" offset="779561">Appellant then filed a suit in the Michigan Court of Claims seeking a refund of those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.712" offset="819371">The court of claims ruled against Appellant, and Appellant then appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.705" offset="1707326">I think the statute by implication says that it consents to the taxation if the tax is nondiscriminatory, but does not consent if the tax is discriminatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.738" offset="1799486">I think the two should be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.405" offset="1806173">In, in other words, the constitutional provision is important in defining what's meant by nondiscriminatory as in the light of intergovernmental tax relations between the federal and state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.712" offset="1855388">The Memphis Bank &amp; Trust case in... involved a somewhat similar situation in the context of taxation on banks as distinguished from taxation on employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.840" offset="1923829">And in that case, the State of Tennessee taxed bank earnings under a formula where earnings from... which in... included interest on federal securities but excluded interest on state securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.687" offset="2003241">And this Court held that that was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.055" offset="2020691">And we had the same situation in Michigan, and Michigan had to make refunds of substantial amounts to Michigan banks as a result of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.311" offset="2057784">The Public Salary Tax Act, as I say, was pending at the time the Graves case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.129" offset="2161020">The State of Michigan takes the position that 4 U.S.C. 111 applies by its terms only to present federal officers and employees, and the state asserts that Appellant is a retiree and not a federal employee, which of course is conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.946" offset="2264256">But the statute is not limited to compensation of present employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.684" offset="2283273">It expressly covers pay or compensation for personal services as an officer or employee of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.854" offset="2315874">Appellant submits that his compensation is clearly part of his compensation as a federal employee and the cases which we've cited in our brief show that the courts consider retirement compensation as... or retirement benefits as deferred compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.850" offset="2399884">And one of the cases refers to the federal retirement system as a deferred compensation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.170" offset="2429141">The brief of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees, filed as an amicus brief in this case, discusses the legislative history of the Retirement Act, and spells out various statements by the sponsors of that Act indicating that the retirement benefits are considered part of compensation and are matters of right and not matters of grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.822" offset="2535825">And the Treasury regulations which were enforced before 1933 also treated compensation... treated retirement benefits as compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.116" offset="2600922">They also exempted... specifically exempted retirement benefits of state employees during that period, and that of course was in accordance with the intergovernmental tax immunities, which started with McCullogh v. Maryland.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.807" offset="5291744">The first is the point Justice Stevens was inquiring about that the federal retirees are not singled out for a tax imposed upon them alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.429" offset="5334271">As I noted, the Court has already unanimously rejected that argument in both the Memphis Bank case and in the Phillips Chemical case in which private parties dealing with the federal government, as well as federal employees, were taxed in a similar way whereas the state got a special tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.778" offset="5427580">In both cases, the Court stressed that however it treats private entities, the state cannot impose a heavier tax burden on those who deal with the federal government than on those with whom it deals itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.459" offset="5610333">In the County of Fresno case, in Justice Stevens in his dissent made an argument as to why such a tax would be constitutionally suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.198" offset="5649308">The majority did not have to deal with that question in that case, however, because the Court specifically found that private parties, state employees and federal employees were all treated in a similar way, that there was no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.290" offset="5709703">I would note that there is one case in 1962 in which the Court summarily affirmed a district court decision upholding a tax exemption given to charitable organizations that did not apply to either the states or the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.788" offset="5783682">And the reasoning of the district court in that case was that the charitable organizations, because they have no power to tax and are dependent upon voluntary contributions, are not similarly situated with the state and federal governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.499" offset="5858496">Now, because that was a summary affirmance, it's not clear to what extent the precedential value of that would... would exist now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.455" offset="5890366">A final argument that the State of Michigan makes is that the economic burden on the United States is simply not sufficient... significant enough to interfere with essential government functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.013" offset="5948567">But it's precisely that sort of amorphous inquiry into the degree of interference with governmental functions that has been long since abandoned by this Court and has been replaced by the principle of nondiscrimination, which makes such an inquiry unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.874" offset="6015962">Once it is shown that the state's system of taxation viewed as a whole treats those who deal with the states more favorably, no further inquiry is necessary into the economic effects of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.234" offset="6073432">Simply put, the State of Michigan must make a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.704" offset="6091300">They can tax both federal and state pensions, or they can make both federal and state pensions nontaxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.275" offset="6121602">But they cannot impose a tax on federal pensions that does not imply to state pensions, a tax that increases the costs and decreases the revenues of the federal government while simultaneously decreasing the costs and increasing the revenues of the federal... of the state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.236" offset="6193491">It's precisely that sort of disparity in treatment that the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity was designed to prevent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas L. Casey</label>
            <text syncTime="1574.822" offset="6431832">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.893" offset="6448132">Michigan courts held that Mr. Davis is not an employee within the meaning of the... Section 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.914" offset="6480211">We believe that judgment is correct and should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.866" offset="6492018">Alternatively, we believe that even if he is covered by this statute, the Michigan classification system is permissible, because if you look at the legislative history of that statute, it is clear that the only type of discrimination which is prohibited is discrimination which is aimed at or which threatens the efficient operation of the federal government itself, not the individual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.197" offset="6585327">Finally, we submit that if the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity applies, the Michigan classification is still permissible because that doctrine also, when properly interpreted according to its constitutional foundations, only prohibits discrimination which substantially interferes with the federal government's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.895" offset="6672054">They are directed at the sovereigns not at the individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.514" offset="6686578">The Michigan courts decided this case on a preliminary statutory interpretation question: is Mr. Davis, a retiree, an employee within the meaning of Section 111?</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.274" offset="6749585">They found that he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.809" offset="6755750">We believe that decision is absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.928" offset="6768184">It is consistent with the definition of employee and annuitant in the civil service statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.331" offset="6789814">It's consistent with the definitions in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.116" offset="6804965">It's consistent with definitions in the Michigan Income Tax Act and the Michigan Administrative Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.454" offset="6826281">For those reasons, the judgment should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.889" offset="6840073">If, however, the Court finds that Mr. Davis is deemed to be an employee and may assert the protections of this statute, we must look further into the background of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.280" offset="6889602">Unlike Mr. Davis and the federal government, we submit that this statute is more than merely a codification of the constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.422" offset="6930248">We believe when you look at the, the congressional history and the context of the times and the evolution of the doctrine, it's clear that the statute does two things, both of which are designed to narrow the preexisting constitutional doctrine as it existed before Graves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.133" offset="7001092">The first thing the statute does is it contains a broad waiver of immunity for employees, and the other thing that the statute does, it contains a narrow exception to that immunity for taxation which discriminates against employees because of the source of the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.178" offset="7073190">As we'll show, the legislative history indicates that that portion of the statute was intended to preserve the immunity of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.328" offset="7185830">The text of the bills was debated on the House and Senate floors, but there... there was no debate that I've been able to locate dealing with this discrimination question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.803" offset="7231701">Those reports from the House and Senate committees clearly indicate... we've quoted them on... in our brief on page 34 and 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.759" offset="7271512">There's an extensive quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.028" offset="7276632">It's from the Senate report pages 11 and 12, and the first sentence there reads:</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.966" offset="7308397">"The consent is not intended to operate, nor could it operate, as a consent to any taxation to which as individuals these officers and employees are entitled to object. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.589" offset="7354895">And it goes on to indicate that an individual employee may assert whatever individual constitutional rights he or she may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.195" offset="7389272">If Mr. Davis feels this classification in the Michigan tax system violates his own equal protection rights, he may assert that as an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.701" offset="7423336">We submit that it does not violate those rights since there is substantial rational basis for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.871" offset="7447995">The last line of that quotation indicates the true extent of are... the narrowness of the exception to the broad waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.828" offset="7491776">Quoting from the Senate and House reports,</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.380" offset="7505987">"To protect the Federal Government against the unlikely possibility of State and local taxation of compensation of Federal officers and employees which is aimed at, or threatens the efficient operation of, the Federal Government, the consent is expressly confined to taxation which does not discriminate against such officers or employees because of the source of their compensation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.813" offset="7595744">It's clear that that narrow exception to the broad waiver of immunity was designed to protect the federal government against taxation by the states which is aimed at or threatens the efficient operation of the federal government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.577" offset="9550852">And the only basis for that exception is to protect the federal government as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.314" offset="9573736">Now, this dovetails very neatly with the economic burden cases involving the constitutional doctrine where the Court has pointed out that the... the whole basis for the doctrine is to protect the integrity of two sovereign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.610" offset="9638937">It's not designed to protect in... individual employees from having to pay a higher burden of tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.610" offset="9746980">We believe that's consistent with the congressional history of the statute and with the constitutional principles underlying the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.703" offset="10619365">That we submit is a significant group of state citizens whose votes will protect the federal retirees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.190" offset="10645278">We have argued to some extent in our brief a... we... we've made an argument about the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.331" offset="10693866">Should we lose all our substantive arguments, we admit that Mr. Davis should get his tax refund with interest, but the question arises what about these other 24,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.555" offset="10750709">I've discussed that extensively in our brief, and if the Court has no questions about it, I don't propose to argue it in detail here except to say that we suggest that the proper remedy would be to remand the case to the state to let the state courts or the state legislature make the first determination about whether the exemption should be extended or withdrawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.456" offset="10958330">We put it in more or less as a preventative measure to indicate that if the choice is between extending the exemption to the federal retirees or withdrawing it from the state retirees, we would prefer extending it to the state retirees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.818" offset="11027816">If I may briefly conclude, we suggest that Mr. Davis and the United States in this case are asking the Court for a per se rule that he as an individual retired federal employee is entitled to every tax benefit that Michigan law gives retired state employees, regardless of whether the federal government as a sovereign entity suffers any adverse effects from the state tax statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.135" offset="11133037">We urge this Court to reject such a per se rule and instead interpret the federal statute and the constitutional doctrine according to their fundamental underlying premise, which is protecting the functions of government as entities from the taxing power of other government... governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.597" offset="11206911">The, the purpose of the constitutional doctrine and the purpose of the statute is not to protect individual employees as individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.368" offset="11242020">Mr. Davis has his own individual equal protection remedy he may assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.420" offset="11258216">The purpose of the statute and the Constitution is to protect governments as sovereigns from each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.308" offset="11281726">We submit that on the facts of this case, there has been no allegation and no showing that the Michigan classification system has that kind of effect on the federal government and, therefore, the judgment of the State of Michigan Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul S. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="2810.174" offset="11373154">If the Court please, the argument with respect to the scope of the statute... the, the state takes the position that present employees are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.270" offset="11465628">But the present retirees who are no longer present employees are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.257" offset="11485585">But the statute does not limit the scope to present employees because it says... refers to compensation for personal services as an officer or employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.882" offset="11536054">And as I mentioned earlier, this is deferred compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.036" offset="11552668">So, it's our position that this is clearly within the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.171" offset="11573148">Now, with respect to the adverse effect on the United States government, both in the Phillips case and in the Memphis Bank case, the objections were made, in one case by the landowner or lessee, in the other case by the bank, not by the government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.020" offset="11656635">And those... those cases demonstrate that once discrimination is shown, that is the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.340" offset="11685892">It's not necessary to show a specific damage or economic effects to the government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.661" offset="11715149">And that's the reason for the... in effect, a blanket ban on discrimination against the federal government.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2903.767" offset="11747541">Of course, in the Phillips case, Mr. Davis, it was the government... the United States was the owner of the underlying leasehold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.789" offset="11775649">So, I suppose you can say it suffered damage by demonstration as soon as the tax was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.324" offset="11793830">Here you're a degree or two removed from that, the tax being on... on your income and not on the government.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul S. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="2921.745" offset="11819535">Well, it's a difference of degree, but still the... the impact was on somebody dealing with the United States, just as retirees are people who are former employees of the government who deal with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.155" offset="11873138">So, it's... the same principle should be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.559" offset="11894767">Now, a question was raised about this overall impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.915" offset="11932175">Now, there are several other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.298" offset="11937713">In Appellant's brief mention was made of the... I, I guess it may have been the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.770" offset="11967597">Mention was made of the fact that the State of Virginia and the State of Georgia have similar statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.090" offset="11988913">And the brief of the National Association which intervened, which has appeared as an amicus, also mentions the States of Arizona, New York and Arkansas as being states which have similar statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.933" offset="12052233">So, it may have a broad effect in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.468" offset="12062369">I don't think that's particularly relevant, but since the Court asked about it, I thought it might be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.721" offset="12091417">With, with respect to the remedy, as has been pointed out, Appellant takes the position he's entitled to a refund of the taxes which he has paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.131" offset="12145020">And for the future, it is up to the state to decide whether it should extend the exemption to... given by the state to its retirees to all federal retirees, or whether the state should tax both its own and federal retirees which is done by some other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.545" offset="12226731">If the Court has no further questions, I... I have nothing further.</text>
