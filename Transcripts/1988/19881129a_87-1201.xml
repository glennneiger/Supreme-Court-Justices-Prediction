            <label>Ms. Laurie Webb Daniel</label>
            <text syncTime="24.492" offset="233162">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="28.162" offset="247895">This case is before the Court on writ of certiorari to the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.284" offset="272346">The principal issue to be decided by this Court is whether the Osternecks' request for prejudgment interest, which was made immediately after a trial of the Osternecks' claims, is a motion falling under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.574" offset="341518">This question is crucial to this case because if the Osternecks' request for prejudgment interest is considered a Rule 59(e) motion, then under Rule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the motion would have the effect of suspending the finality of the judgment and of nullifying the Osternecks' notice of appeal which was filed within 30 days of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.814" offset="434409">The Eleventh Circuit found that the Osternecks' request for prejudgment interest is a Rule 59(e) motion which prevented it from having jurisdiction to hear the Osternecks' appeal from the judgment entered in favor of Ernst &amp; Whinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.341" offset="488535">The Osternecks are asking this Court to reverse and demand for three basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.071" offset="515493">First, the Osternecks' request simply does not fit the definition of a Rule 59(e) motion as explained by the legislative history and the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.536" offset="561364">Second, the Osternecks' request cannot be distinguished from a request for attorney's fees, which this Court has found does not fall within the scope of Rule 59(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="117.375" offset="604728">Third, to hold in the Osternecks' favor would be consistent with traditional principles of finality and appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.355" offset="644643">There are few background facts which may be helpful to this Court in deciding this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.040" offset="671392">The background facts are brief and, and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.915" offset="686857">This case was litigated for almost 10 years before a jury trial was finally reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.505" offset="717263">The jury trial lasted three-and-a-half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.503" offset="729175">Every issue was completely litigated during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.940" offset="746938">After three-and-a-half months of trial, the jury returned a verdict on all of the Osternecks' claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.203" offset="775986">The jury found that certain of the defendants were liable for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.374" offset="792705">However, the jury found that Ernst &amp; Whinney was not liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.231" offset="808169">Immediately after the jury determined the liability and damages on the Osternecks' claims, the Osternecks' asked the trial judge to add prejudgment interest to the amount awarded by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.225" offset="864071">The trial judge at that point determined that the prejudgment interest issue should be handled separately, and the trial judge instructed the Osternecks to submit briefs on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.470" offset="913077">At the same time, the trial judge instructed the clerk of the court to enter final judgment pursuant to the jury verdict determining liability and damages on all of the Osternecks' claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.132" offset="1011715">The Osternecks' request for prejudgment interest didn't affect anything that the jury decided with regard to any of the defendants as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.628" offset="1045675">The request, in fact, accepted the jury's determination of liability and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.283" offset="1072319">The request was based on the jury's determination of liability and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.999" offset="1091232">In fact, in the... in the written motion and in the briefs, the Osternecks told the trial court this is what the jury found and we want prejudgment interest based on that to be calculated.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.678" offset="1181929">So, it's under the rule that... in a 10(b)(5) case where... that prejudgment interest is not a matter of right; it is a discretionary matter for the trial judge to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.472" offset="1365100">When the prejudgment interest was added several months later, the trial court was careful in his order to make it clear that he was not changing any of the decisions embodied in the judgment that was entered on the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.621" offset="1421733">He specified that other than the addition of the prejudgment interest, the judgment entered on the jury verdict was to remain the same in all respects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.254" offset="8096228">The purpose of the rule is to combine in one review all stages of the proceeding that effectively may be reviewed and corrected if and when final judgment results.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.294" offset="8328404">A new notice of appeal must be filed from the entry of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.417" offset="8344914">As this Court recognized in Griggs, that is mandatory and jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.681" offset="8361946">By precluding appellate jurisdiction until the district court completely resolves all issues affecting the judgment, Rule 4(a)(4) and Civil Rule 59(e) implement the final judgment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.003" offset="8407190">Here until Petitioners' motion for prejudgment interest was decided, the litigation on the merits was not over and the judgment was not yet right for execution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.714" offset="8482109">To allow an appeal of a judgment before a plaintiff's entitlement to discretionary prejudgment interest is resolved by the district court, we believe would contravene the requirements of Section 1291 to effect simultaneous appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.226" offset="8536130">Thus, the traditional treatment of post-judgment requests for discretionary prejudgment interest as within 59(e) and not independently appealable is consistent with the unitary appeal rule set forth in Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.515" offset="8597257">Treating Petitioners' request for prejudgment interest as an independent proceeding and permitting a separate appeal from the judgment establishing other elements of compensation on the very same claim ignores important considerations of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.087" offset="8671549">And most importantly, Petitioners advance no cogent reason why an award of discretionary prejudgment interest should be an exception to 1291 requirement of a unified appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.567" offset="8713449">Narrow exceptions to the requirement of a single appeal exist only pursuant to statutory authorization or where certain decisions of the district court are completely separate from the merits and necessity or long tradition mandate separate appellate review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.544" offset="9717387">And that brings us directly, we believe, within Rule 59 and in the mandatory provisions of Rule A(a)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.041" offset="9739330">This case, as I said, does not comply with the very limited collateral order doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2425.282" offset="9836297">Indeed, the most recent cases from this Court seem to have narrowed the collateral order doctrine even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.171" offset="9863882">The order must conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and be so that it is effectively unreviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.462" offset="9905051">Of course, that definition does not fit this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.009" offset="9919262">As discussed earlier, the Federal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure mandate except in narrow circumstances that the district court consider post-trial motions that may affect the verdict or judgment before a unified appeal on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.784" offset="9978298">Separate review of post-verdict and post-judgment motions are even more limited than pre-verdict and judgment review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.577" offset="10009541">By statute, Rule 58, of course entry of judgment shall not be delayed for the taxing of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.824" offset="10034514">Therefore, you can have a final judgment even though tax are not... excuse me... costs are not taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.431" offset="10056979">And this Court we believe effectively importing the narrow exceptions in Cohen into the construction of Rule 59(e) held that a prevailing party's request for attorney's fees raised legal issues basically collateral to the main cause of action, put forward a bright line test that their award was separable, and that the judgment not including attorney's fees was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.203" offset="10152065">We do not believe that the Court's decisions in White or Budinich are support for prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.185" offset="10179964">As Justice Scalia mentioned, we believe that this is no different than punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.901" offset="10202847">For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act specifically states that punitive damages shall be decided by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.039" offset="10231373">If that were the case and the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, it is clear that you could not appeal from the judgment entered on that verdict until the puritive damage issue was decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.404" offset="10328862">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.139" offset="10331787">Of course, as the Court said in Budinich, a claim for attorney's fees is not a part of the merits to which the fees pertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.870" offset="10362716">It does not remedy the injury giving rise to the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.400" offset="10376822">At common law, attorney's fees were regarded as an element of costs awarded to the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.742" offset="10402213">The Court in White and Budinich also identified positive, affirmative reasons for separating attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.393" offset="10440770">To hold otherwise would have encouraged piecemeal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.031" offset="10459369">A counsel would have been filing fee requests after what appeared to be final orders in lengthy civil rights litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.214" offset="10500016">The problem also occurred because counsel would not have an opportunity to negotiate private settlements of their fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.994" offset="10531154">Now here, unlike the affirmative policy reading supporting appeals of collateral orders, there are no affirmative reasons why an award of prejudgment interest is independent of any other aspects of a plaintiff's damage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.738" offset="10586115">Here an award of prejudgment interest is not separable from fine merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.648" offset="10861759">If the court is concerned that the jury should not hear interest rates and the lost use of money, then he can hold a separate hearing outside the presence of the jury during one day of the trial, and you can have all the evidence relating to the prejudgment interest issue before the trial judge so he can make a decision on that depending on what the jury does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.575" offset="10953502">Alternatively, if the issue is protracted, he may wait until the jury returns a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.089" offset="10975549">If the jury returns a verdict for the defendants, all of them, the issue is not right for his review obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.961" offset="10999059">Otherwise, he could do what he did here and hold a very short post-judgment hearing dealing with the merits and then amend the judgment to reflect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.833" offset="11030511">So, I think there are several ways to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.411" offset="11036884">We also believe that the test suggested by the Petitioners is one which this Court has rejected and we believe that they fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.063" offset="11083487">Basically, as we understand it, Petitioners, state that any motion which will then not affect a previous judgment or ruling of the court is not a Rule 59(e) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.542" offset="11129358">Of course, that clashes with the Court's interpretation of 1291 and would render such things a partial summary judgment on liability appealable because then compensatory damages would not affect that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.099" offset="11191634">And, of course, it would permit summary judgment for one defendant in a multiparty action to be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.785" offset="11210337">Of course, the drafters of Rule 54(b) preclude this result as well as decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.299" offset="11232385">Finally, we believe that the unique circumstances in Thompson do not merit reversal of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.937" offset="11263000">That decision we believe should be strictly limited to its facts where a judge affirmatively misled a party believing that a post-trial motion was timely filed, therefore, indicating to the party that it did not file a notice of appeal within 30 days but rather file it within the time period after the pretrial motion was disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.630" offset="11353697">In that case, four judges dissented, we believe quite correctly, pointing cut that to... the more exceptions we have to the rules, the more mischief we'll have in our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.345" offset="11396538">The rules are technical and they need to be to ensure accuracy in appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.256" offset="11496222">That deals with pretrial collateral issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.863" offset="11510641">We're in this case dealing with a post-trial motion when all other issues had been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.080" offset="11535510">And as a practical matter, the concern for piecemeal appeals is not great where you have... you have resolved the main issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.452" offset="11580963">In this situation where you've had a trial, all the other issues have been decided, a post-judgment motion like this could easily be consolidated with the prior appeal as it was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.930" offset="11630909">The Eleventh Circuit heard oral argument on the merits of the Osternecks' appeal against Ernst &amp; Whinney along with the prejudgment interest questions.</text>
