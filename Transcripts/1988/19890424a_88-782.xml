            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142212">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-782, United States Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.038" offset="182336">Mr. Wallace?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="11.100" offset="186516">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.351" offset="203548">This Freedom of Information Act case reflects the not unique circumstance that the Federal Government is a party to all federal tax litigation, as it is to a number of other categories of litigation, such as Federal Tort Claims Act cases, government contracts, mall fraud prosecutions, FOIA cases, and others that might occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.010" offset="310232">Since 1972, the Respondent has published a weekly report of developments in federal taxation for which it charges its subscribers an annual fee of $595.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.392" offset="375747">And since 1979, the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, pursuant to FOIA, has provided to Respondent and other commercial tax services weekly logs of court decisions of which the Department has been informed in federal tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.969" offset="474072">This controversy arises out of 26 weekly requests that Respondent made beginning in November of 1984 for the United States district court opinions, orders and decisions in tax cases identified in the log released during the previous week.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.329" offset="587443">It apparently occurred to Respondent that the Department of Justice, which receives these orders and decisions as a litigator, might be a either more reliable, or at least more convenient, source of these decisions than the courts issuing them and perhaps part of the convenience would be a less expensive source, since the rather elaborate fee provisions under FOIA are designed in large part to keep the costs down in order to facilitate access to information about what the government is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.564" offset="792452">This type of request, whatever its convenience to the requester, is quite inconvenient and burdensome to the government as a litigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.355" offset="855564">These opinions and orders are not collected in any one place for the government's convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.741" offset="893076">They come in in a mass of paper flow and by various routes, and the managerial problem is to get them routed with reasonable promptness to the lawyer assigned or the lawyer now assigned to the case, since there is considerable turnover in the government, so that the government can perform its responsibilities as a litigator in the cases, decide whether to take an appeal if the case has been lost, proceed to enforce the judgment, what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.518" offset="1048243">These are not used by the Department as a research tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.982" offset="1082098">They are used for purposes of conducting the litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.647" offset="1108743">Mr. Wallace, as far as the inconvenience is concerned, though, the Respondents suggest that maybe that's the way you do it now, but it would be no great inconvenience to simply instruct each attorney in the field that when the court opinion is issued and he forwards a copy to wherever he now forwards it, another copy also be sent to some central repository where you would have all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.892" offset="1201739">Would that be... that seems plausible to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.971" offset="1314065">The attorneys receive them in two or three days time typically.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.516" offset="1348233">It takes a while to distribute them.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.620" offset="1364638">If there were routine duplication, which does not occur now, at the clerical level, further delay would be added inevitably.</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.178" offset="9098868">This Court has had to deal with that question with respect to three kinds of documents: pre-sentence reports in the case of U.S. v.

Julian; consultants' records that the agency never got, as in Forsham; and White House records that were stored at the agency, but which were never controlled or used by the agency in pertinent part here, and that was the Kissinger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.165" offset="9198865">The Court has looked to five characteristics in those cases to determine what... whether the documents were agency records.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.101" offset="9294578">Fourth, does the agency incorporate the papers in its own files?</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.714" offset="9312968">And fifth, do the papers include information about the agency's operations?</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.614" offset="13216602">We have to be concerned here not merely with publishers' requests, but with requests of law firms, academic researchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.520" offset="13256204">Some of the law firms may be Tax Analysts subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.914" offset="13277833">And, of course, if we receive Tax Analysts publication, the lawyers in the Department use the analysis that Tax Analysts has furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.900" offset="13313778">I think that this Court's decision 33 days ago in describing the purposes of FOIA and the limitations on those purposes goes far toward providing the answer in this case, the decision in the Reporters Committee case involving rap sheets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.188" offset="13414924">The basic policy of FOIA, the Court said, was focused on the citizen's right to be informed about what the agency is doing, what the government is up to, not to receive information that may be accumulated in the agency's files or other resources that reflects what somebody else has done, in that case information about a private citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.479" offset="13528086">And quite tellingly, the Court quoted with approval, among various commentators about the act a... a comment in the Harvard Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Law Review after saying that the Act was designed to expose official conduct to public scrutiny, and the two sentences quoted, with apparent approval by the Court from this comment, was that no statement was made in Congress that the Act was designed for a broader purpose, such as making the government's collection of data available to anyone who has any socially useful purpose for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.727" offset="13689105">For example, it was never suggested that the FOIA would be a boon to academic researchers by eliminating their need to assemble on their own data which the government has already collected.</text>
