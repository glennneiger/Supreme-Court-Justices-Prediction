            <text syncTime="12.683" offset="189353">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.696" offset="217356">In 1969, fourteen years before the Korean Air Lines airplane disaster, Korean Air Lines was warned by the existing state of the law that it would be liable under the circumstances claimed before this court for actual compensatory damages sustained by the families of the deceased passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.621" offset="341072">At that time the state of the law had been articulated by three appellate court decisions of the federal circuits and one of the high court of one state.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="410244">In addition, the United States government through the Solicitor General, in Lisi against Alitalia Airlines in which the Second Circuit held the airline liable for failing to give the passenger adequate notice of the damage limitation, this court equally divided and therefore affirmed, Justice Marshall not participating.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.572" offset="524869">The rationale of the appellate court decisions existing at the time Korean Airlines in 1969 signed the Montreal Agreement and obligated itself to certain responsibilities, the state of the law at that time was rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.282" offset="615775">It held that both the language, the literal language of the Warsaw Treaty required adequate notice by the airline to each passenger of the damage limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.947" offset="686411">At that time the Warsaw Treaty provided for a $&lt;ten thousand&gt; [= 10,000] damage limitation for each passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.147" offset="723191">In order to obtain the benefit of that limit, these courts uniformly held that there must be adequate notice warning the passenger of the limitation so that each passenger would have choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.169" offset="803335">A passenger could choose to obtain protection by insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.276" offset="827681">Some passenger might choose not to fly.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.369" offset="844086">The choice was to be given to each passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.164" offset="863312">In addition, these cases uniformly held that the history, the drafting history of the treaty corroborated the language of the history in dictating that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.283" offset="923707">And those cases were Lisi against Alitalia Airlines, Warren and Mertens against Flying Tiger Airline, involving the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="407.899" offset="1770179">There is a passage on that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.804" offset="1785852">It is part of the report of Mr. Henry De Vos, the "reporter"... the reporter was the person in charge of the drafting committee, its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.174" offset="1843322">And on page A-86 under Section 1, passenger ticket, the third paragraph makes it clear, I believe, that the sanction and throughout the history the sanction is the loss of the damage limitation, was linked to the delivery of the ticket without a statement or the nondelivery of a ticket to the forfeiture of the damage limitation, as they put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.346" offset="1992011">And that same principle applied whether we dealt with a passenger ticket, a baggage check or cargo involving an air waybill.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="475.794" stopTime="481.526">

            <text syncTime="481.886" offset="2066198">And the reason for that, Justice O'Connor, is that when it came to baggage checks and air waybills for cargo, the drafters, unlike the passenger ticket, considered some of those provisions to be compulsory, mandatory, invoking the sanction, whereas other provisions, the mere form that would be nonsubstantive, were not considered to be compulsory and, consequently, the language used in drafting the terms, Article 4 and 8 and 9 for the cargo and baggage, made the distinction between the important document requirements and the unimportant ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.083" offset="2278939">And there the statement that's the subject of this appeal is commonly considered to be a very important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.078" offset="2326900">It's the only one that is common to all of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.061" offset="2342887">Each of the three documents have individual items that are peculiar to the passenger or the baggage or the cargo, but the one common ingredient for all of the documents, including the passenger ticket, is the warning statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.912" offset="2414254">And throughout the history, a large part of the debate focused about these noncompulsory items.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.409" offset="2452288">There never was any argument or debate controverting the significance of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.485" offset="2480605">The statement was always considered to be the essential ingredient for the airline to gain the benefit of the limitation--</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.127" offset="6931139">And the rules of the convention, Justice Scalia, include the sanctions for not meeting certain points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.125" offset="6955171">The second... there are basically two arguments in front of their position, and the second depends upon the comparing of the language of Article 3 and Article 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.668" offset="6993310">There, too, we believe that if you look at the history of the treaty's drafting, it's apparent that the wording, the difference in wording between Articles 3 and 4 was bottomed on two amendments to Article 3 adopted at the convention itself, the Greek and the Japanese amendment, neither of which was intended to allow the liability limitation to apply in the absence of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.613" offset="7077111">The second question presented by this case, even assuming that sanction applies, concerns the accuracy of the notice that, in fact, appeared on the passenger tickets in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.062" offset="7118907">We agree there with petitioners that type size is relevant to that inquiry and that the notice given on respondent's ticket was inadequate to the extent that it was only eight point notice, eight point type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.635" offset="7169166">The executive branch long ago announced its view that ten point type notice was required on airline passenger tickets to give the public adequate notice of a liability limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.599" offset="7217023">Now, we recognize that the selection of any one type size obviously contains some elements of arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.925" offset="7246280">The problem is that individuals, individual human beings, don't react to varying type size the way that chemical compounds such as water react the varying temperatures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.030" offset="7294763">But the necessity of such inevitable uncertainty, the fact that it will exist, does not cause us to shy away in other areas of the law to come up with a clear standard, and we don't believe it should here either.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.210" offset="11415423">In 1953, as a result, I submit, of the famous Jane Froman case, arising out of the USO tour accident in Lisbon in 1943 in 19... which resulted in litigation ending in 1949 where Jane Froman, who had been with the USO troupe recovered the sum of $8,300 for her substantial injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.420" offset="11512285">The United States suddenly became aware at the government level there's something wrong here because she never saw her ticket, she never agreed to a limitation on liability, and she didn't even know she was going to Lisbon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.211" offset="11563485">Now in 1953 the United States decided to take steps at the diplomatic level to amend the treaty, and one of those steps was to require notice of the limitation of liability in the convention amount, specifically in the notice, in contrasting color, in a minimum type size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.327" offset="11651883">And in 1955 the United States was able to persuade the rest of the international community to agree to the notice, but not the color, not the type size, and not the amount, just the notice, in the Hague Protocol.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.824" offset="13849931">The United States is considering further amendments to the treaty to perpetuate its existence as the supreme law of this land, and I submit that it is very important for the rest of the world to knew that when the United States commits itself to a treaty, it will be applied as intended by the lower courts of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.613" offset="13921088">And I urge for that reason that the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</text>
