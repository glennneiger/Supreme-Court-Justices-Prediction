            <text syncTime="16.426" offset="209874">Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="24.948" offset="244042">Although I appear here today on behalf of taxpayers in these cases, my position is quite unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.471" offset="278105">My purpose is to convince you to endorse the interpretation of Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code first announced by the IRS in 1919 and, with the exception of this litigation, maintained consistently by the IRS since that time, at least through September 22nd of this year, when IRS Assistant Commissioner Brower restated what he described as the cumulative IRS position in these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.227" offset="421152">And I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="71.512" offset="430243">"Religious observances generally are not regarded as yielding private benefits when attending the observances. "</text>
            <text syncTime="80.868" offset="467650">"The primary beneficiaries are viewed as being the general public and members of the faith. "</text>
            <text syncTime="87.356" offset="493668">"Thus, payments for saying masses, pew rents, tithes, and other payments involving fixed donations for similar religious services are fully deductible contributions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="105.567" offset="566497">This case, Your honor, involves fixed donations for religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.023" offset="600247">And under the position of the IRS for the last 70 years, the payments should be fully deductible contributions.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.635" offset="670778">But in the case of making distinctions among religions for disallowing deductions by the participants and members of that faith to participate in religious observances, I think that the IRS and this Court should await guidance from Congress about what it means to distinguish among religions on these grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.737" offset="791150">Well, Mr. Graetz, what flexibility does the IRS have to change its view in its regulations from time to time?</text>
            <text syncTime="168.760" offset="819258">And doesn't it do so in other instances?</text>
            <text syncTime="172.812" offset="835454">And has this Court ever taken the view that it can't change its mind?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Graetz</label>
            <text syncTime="178.032" offset="856352">Justice O'Connor, this Court has in numerous opinions expressed that in the tax law there is a need for clarity, particularity, predictability, and special deference to the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.593" offset="934615">There are only two cases in the last decade that this Court has endorsed a change in administrative position by the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.433" offset="969932">The first is the Bob Jones University case, and in that instance the majority of the Court found considerable evidence in the legislature that the change in IRS position was one that Congress intended the IRS to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.262" offset="1049240">The other instance was a case involving interest-free loans under the Gift Tax, and the treatment of interest-free loans under the Gift Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.570" offset="1090514">And there you had a dramatic change in economic circumstances... it's the Dicksan case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.474" offset="1114128">You had a dramatic change in economic circumstances that made Gift Tax avoidance possible through the use of interest-free loans where no such avoidance had been possible in prior years until the change in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.270" offset="1185286">Those are the only two instances that I'm aware of in the last decade that this Court has endorsed such a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.173" offset="1208901">Here the IRS has not expressed a change in position through regulation, it has not withdrawn rulings to the contrary, it has not announced a general principle for churches and synagogues, and their members to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.183" offset="1276923">It in fact doesn't seem to have changed its administrative position, if, if Commissioner Brower is stating the position correctly.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="292.289" offset="1313390">Well, Mr. Graetz, even if we accent your approach to the deductibility for auditing, what about training?</text>
            <text syncTime="299.776" offset="1343274">And why isn't that like tuition and non-deductible?</text>

            <text syncTime="309.464" offset="1382040">One is, I think that the case law and the precedents clearly distinguish tuition at religious schools, which involve a secular--</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Graetz</label>
            <text syncTime="326.343" offset="1449541">Well, the Court below did not distinguish auditing and training.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.914" offset="1467826">The stipulations indicate that training involves an educational component that is not involved in auditing.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.818" offset="1499487">However, the testimony, the uncontradicted testimony below, was that training Is similar to the study of sacred texts, in various other religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.712" offset="1571062">And the court, the tax court, which made the factual findings, found that these were payments for religious services without distinguishing the payments for training and the payments for auditing, although I think that there may be some--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="376.526" stopTime="379.811">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="376.526" offset="1650265">But you concede there may be a basis for making that distinction?</text>

            <text syncTime="379.811" offset="1663431">--Well, I think, Your Honor, that the only basis that I, that I can see in the record for making that distinction is where the training is undertaken for the purpose of, of becoming a minister, that is of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.106" offset="1728633">And the taxpayers in the cases below did not undertake the training for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.593" offset="1758621">They only undertook the training for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.164" offset="1772832">And in that case I think it's like Sunday School that's normally included in the dues of a church--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="414.651" offset="1802821">Would the deductibility of tuition at a theology school be dependent on whether you want to be a minister when you get through?</text>

            <text syncTime="422.424" offset="1833854">--No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.407" offset="1837825">I think that here the test is one that needs to be limited to the conduct of religious worship, and in limited cases perhaps, religious instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.349" offset="1893622">But I would not go beyond that, and it is really the fact that the tax court below did not make any factual findings that are different about the two services, that it clearly regarded training in these cases as a form of religious worship, and not a form of religious education, or a form of secular education with religious components.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.299" offset="1993410">The crucial issue, I think, below was that the payments here are fixed and mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.693" offset="2066971">And I think that is the basis of the appellate court's decisions that affirmed the tax court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.866" offset="2095705">And I think that that issue is one that has been terribly confused in, in the courts and in which some clarification is necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.924" offset="2143875">Before you move on, just something you said.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.924" offset="2151921">Is it conceded that this was religious worship as opposed to religious instruction?</text>
            <text syncTime="509.279" offset="2181283">Is that part of the stipulation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_j_graetz" startTime="510.945" stopTime="564.866">
            <label>Mr. Michael J. Graetz</label>
            <text syncTime="510.945" offset="2187970">The finding of fact and the stipulations are that with respect to auditing, there is no educational component.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.670" offset="2226840">With respect to training there is an educational component.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.372" offset="2241678">And the tax court found that the taxpayers had made their payments to participate in religious services, so that the tax court, did not distinguish the educational component of training.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.299" offset="2301446">And these taxpayers, the taxpayers who undertook training in this case, all testified that they did so as a study of sacred text and the expert witness who testified testified the same things.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.843" offset="2375529">So it seems to me that the tax court's finding of fact in this case is a reasonable finding of fact.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="564.866" offset="2403637">One can study a sacred text without, without worshiping.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.318" offset="2417430">I mean, one could go to, you know, theology school and study sacred text, and that's not necessarily an act of worship, as are many of the other examples that you, that you raise in your brief, such as high holy day services and so forth.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Graetz</label>
            <text syncTime="581.959" offset="2472078">No, Your Honor, and all, all that we are asking is that, that religious observances, the conduct of religious worship, which is a phrase that appears In the Internal Revenue Code regulations numerous times, is not the sort of quo... to use the government's repetitive phrase of quid pro quo... is not the sort of quo that will disqualify charitable contribution deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.609" offset="2578657">And we do not take the position that education is deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.715" offset="2611049">There are cases, there's a long line of authority that says that payments to a parochial school, or a religious school, are non-deductible, and I think that would apply to a divinity school as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.991" offset="2668205">It is here that the, that the act of studying the sacred text is in fact an act of worship, and it can be an act of worship, and the tax court seems to have so found, although its opinion here does not, is not a model of clarity on this point, because it did not distinguish the auditing from the training in, in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.590" offset="2758589">It is... it is also important to note, however, that in all of the cases that the government relies upon, that deductions have been disallowed in whole or in part, and they almost always are in part, for payments In order to participate in religious education.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.801" offset="2839359">That... those cases, and here I'm talking about Oppewal and DeJong and Haak and the cases the government cites, those cases involve voluntary payments, not fixed payments, and not mandatory payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.263" offset="2905292">In fact, the Oppewal case, which the IRS addresses in a revenue ruling that the government relies upon, in a 1983 revenue ruling, is described in a, in a situation in that ruling, as situation four, and in that situation the, the person in charge of the school came and sat down with each parent and discussed what would be an appropriate contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.616" offset="3018664">And that's very similar to the kind of fundraising that occurs in many churches throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.686" offset="3050951">And in that case the court said, the deduction is allowed only to the extent that it exceeds the cost of the education.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.292" offset="3081358">Now the reason for that in the Internal Revenue Cone is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.511" offset="3098285">There you had secular education that had a religious component.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.148" offset="3112809">The reason for that is that there are regulations under Section 262 that limit the ability of people to deduct their educational expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.836" offset="3155545">And the court was very concerned, and the courts have been concerned in the religious education context with not permitting people to obtain deductible education when offered by a church and not be allowed to deduct it when offered elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.667" offset="3234853">And this Court itself, in the Bob Jones case, distinguished religious education from religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.404" offset="3261812">And we have no, we have no quarrel--</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.092" offset="6748532">The question before the Court today is whether payments made by Petitioners in order to participate in auditing and training sessions sponsored by the Church of Scientology are deductible from gross income as charitable contributions under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.387" offset="6817704">The tax court, relying on the same definition of charitable contribution that this Court subsequently endorsed in the American Bar... American Bar Endowment case, concluded that the payments made by the Petitioners were not charitable contributions but rather were purchases of auditing and training services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.349" offset="6885622">We've heard a great deal from Mr. Graetz about the facts that involve other religious denominations in their fundraising practices, but I think it's appropriate to begin by stressing very briefly some of the facts that the tax court found in reaching that particular conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.762" offset="6975274">First, the tax court found that the Church of Scientology charges a fixed fee for participation in auditing and training sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.784" offset="7007353">Next, it found that the payment of these fees is a prerequisite of participation in auditing and training sessions, and that with few exceptions these services are never given for free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.759" offset="7051238">In addition, the tax court found that the church had a practice of offering discounts both for advance payment of fees and for purchases of fees in large quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.115" offset="7096692">And in addition the tax court went on to find that the church has an, an explicit policy of refunding fees paid in advance where a request for a refund is made before the services are rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.624" offset="7146742">The court went on to review the extensive advertising, marketing, and promotional activities of the church and concluded that it operates in a commercial manner in providing its religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.515" offset="7194285">Specifically, the court concluded that, and this is from page 35(a) of the petition appendix, the goal of making money permeates virtually all of the Church of Scientology's activities, its services, its pricing policies, its dissemination policies, and its management decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2684.832" offset="10883506">In the 1919 revenue ruling, in fact, the Treasury stated, is very cryptic, only two short paragraphs long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.318" offset="10917465">But it stated very cryptically that, that from a technical angle one could distinguish per rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.555" offset="10942438">And I think what was meant by that was that there was this quid pro quo element that you were paying for a particular seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.209" offset="10965008">But then they went on to say that they thought that this benefit was conjectural, that it was, that whether or not there was personal accommodation here was conjectural, noted that frequently the same type of accommodations made in an informal basis to people that give basket contributions, and decided that therefore that ordinarily and customarily the intent was probably... the real intent, was probably to make a contribution rather than to purchase that particular element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.360" offset="11077648">I think it's important before getting drawn too far into these discussions of other practices not to lose the big picture here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.899" offset="11115787">And I think the big picture is that the petitioners are arguing for a special rule, a special exemption that would apply only to one type of purchase of services, religious services, and that would in effect make any purchase of religious services per se deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.379" offset="11197707">We think that there are a number of very serious problems with this approach to interpretation of Section 17C, and let me try to list those just briefly for the Court's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.722" offset="11255072">First, there's no way to reconcile the Petitioners' proposed special rule with the language of Section 17C.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.726" offset="11279105">Section 170 establishes one standard, and only one standard, for determining when a deductible charitable contribution has been made to any type of qualifying charitable organization, whether it's engaged in religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.636" offset="11338768">The standard requires that in order to be deductible, a payment must be a contribution or gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.640" offset="11362801">And what Petitioners are proposing, in effect, is to read the gift requirement out of the statute with respect to one type of services, religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.579" offset="11398536">Second, the fact that religious activities provide a subjective and intangible benefit that can't be directly valued doesn't differentiate religious services from other types of activities that are offered by charities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.655" offset="11454856">Poetry readings, concerts, private exhibitions of art, all have a very highly subjective and tangible value to the participant, and there may be no equivalent service in the marketplace that can be used to fix a value of these particular services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.867" offset="11519640">Nevertheless, it's well-established in the Service's revenue rulings that when a charity sets a fixed admissions charge for something like a poetry reading or a private exhibition, and makes payment of that charge a prerequisite of attendance, the price of the fee is presumed to be equal to the value of the services received and hence is non-deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.780" offset="11603336">Third, the special rule that Petitioners urge would in our view aggravate rather than alleviate potential First Amendment concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.402" offset="11641789">Under the gift or contribution standard reflected in Section 170, the deductibility of a payment to a church is determined by a secular standard, whether there was an intention to make a gift rather than a purchase of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.027" offset="11692362">But under the special rule that the petitioners are arguing in favor of, the only possible inquiry that could be made by the Service is whether or not the church is providing bonafide religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.251" offset="11733217">The intrusion and entanglement that would be involved in conducting that inquiry would tar exceed anything that would be presented by looking at the external form or structure of the transaction to see it the payment is a quid pro quo for the provision of services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2925.652" offset="11846798">And I think you have to concede that certainly the IRS ruling back in 1919 and subsequent practice lends some credence to that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.780" offset="11911372">If you look at these revenue rulings that are, that are cited by the Petitioners, you will not see any reference to the proposition that any payment for the provision of religious services is deductible automatically, or any equivalent language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.206" offset="11973021">You will not see any reference to a distinction between secular services and non-secular services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.276" offset="11997263">You will not see any comment to the effect that any provision of religious services is always incidental in the legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.780" offset="12023281">In fact, if you look at something like the 1919 revenue ruling, what you will see is that the Service was applying the same standard that was applied in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.571" offset="12070510">What the Service asked in that particular case was whether the real intent was to contribute to the church or to hire a seat or a pew for personal accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.677" offset="12110948">That's the same distinction that we're being, asking the Court to apply here, the distinction between a gift or contribution and a purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.747" offset="12135190">The 1970 revenue ruling was simply an attempt to update the 1919 revenue ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.067" offset="12164447">There had been a change in statutory provisions and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.436" offset="12173955">There's no analysis in that whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.453" offset="12182001">The other revenue ruling, which is more or less or point, has to do with mass stipends, and that was a 1978 revenue ruling, which made quite clear that the facts that were presented in that case involved a mass that would have been said in any event and a mass that was open to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.564" offset="12242501">And the conclusion it reached was that in most circumstances the payment of the mass stipend was incidental and was not something that would not be deductible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.671" offset="12698912">I have... I don't know that the Internal Revenue has done anything, Justice Marshall, because we don't think that, as I've been explaining to Justice O'Connor, we don't interpret our regulations as being inconsistent with the position that was taken in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.997" offset="12756172">They are simply applications of the same position that we're taking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.615" offset="12766621">I think it's important to realize the argumentative strategy that the Petitioners adopted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.138" offset="12796714">The tax court relied upon a whole list of factors, factual findings, that were strongly indicative of an intention to purchase services rather than to make a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.660" offset="12838824">And what Petitioners have Gone is they've gone town each particular one of those factors and said, oh, but wait, we can point to another religion that has a practice somewhat analogous to that particular element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.349" offset="12881560">And then they say, as to the next factor, well, but wait, there's yet another religion that has another factor like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.253" offset="12905175">But what they haven't done is point to anyone who has all of the features, or anything even close to the features, that are presented by the Church of Scientology in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.157" offset="12932865">They haven't pointed to a case where a church is selling admission tickets at the door in order to attend religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.262" offset="12969227">If such a case did exist, and, and had beer decided differently, then there might be a problem of administrative consistency--</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.499" offset="12990230">Let me go pack just quickly to the point about religious education, because I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.551" offset="13010396">It's well-established that tuition payments for education are not deductible, it's established that that applies to a completely sectarian as well as non-sectarian church school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.192" offset="13056998">No distinction is made as to whether or not the educational instruction serves as a substitute for ordinary schooling or whether it takes place in the Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.615" offset="13086674">And finally, and I think this is the truly critical point, although virtually all the parochial school cases that are cited by Petitioners have involved the provision of purely religious services, as well as educational services, there has never been a suggestion made that there should be some apportionment between the component that reflects the education and the component that reflects the religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.730" offset="13187088">There has been apportionment in those cases, but it's apportionment between the amounts of contributions and the costs, without any differentiation between the costs of the education and the costs of the religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.705" offset="13227003">And the fact that deductions have been disallowed for the religious service component of those cases, I think, does offer substantial support for the proposition that there's nothing radical or untoward about the position that the commissions take in this, in this case, positions taken in this case that religious services should be subject to the same general standard, the same quid pro quo analysis that all types of payments are made under Section 170 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.788" offset="13339330">If the Court has no further questions, thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Graetz</label>
            <text syncTime="3305.961" offset="13368065">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.744" offset="13375170">I... I'd just like to make three points, If I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.163" offset="13384887">One is, Your Honor, that the comparison to other religions' fundraising practices appears in the tax court testimony of the expert witness ant was uncontradicted, and I refer you to page 84 of the joint appendix for that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.974" offset="13452074">So it was not something that was not in the record below, and each of the appellate courts that has decided a case here has recognized that there is a threat to the practices of other religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.849" offset="13503588">Secondly, in response to the question, what is the controlling principle here that the Chief Justice asked, what the government is doing is denying the existence of the controlling principle in all other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.359" offset="13557609">The controlling principle in all other contexts is the relationship of the amount of the payment to the value of what is received in return, and the government concedes, apparently, that you can't value religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.832" offset="13611526">And that was the point that was made by the Second Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, and the Eighth Circuit in finding for the taxpayers here, and without the ability to value then there is no standard here, there is just a, a, a selection of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.859" offset="13671607">And the government's argument makes that absolutely clear, and the prices that are set here, the tax court found, are based on average family income, and they're not in any way a measure of the value of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.388" offset="13737750">There's a footnote in the tax court opinion that points cut that these auditing fees are based on the average family income in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.909" offset="13771813">Third, Your Honor, it seems to me that the government has now made it clear that their problem here is that it's just too cumbersome under the Internal Revenue Code to litigate the tax exemption of organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.503" offset="13826252">And, and if that's the problem, if that's why they've made this dramatic change in their position, then they should be at Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.275" offset="13865332">If there's a problem in enforcing the provisions of Section 501(c)(3), then Congress is the appropriate body to, to address that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.715" offset="13899082">Commercialism, and the role of commercialism, As an extremely complicated question under Section 501(c)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.884" offset="13931787">The tax court finding here in the court below, on the tax exemption easier is a unique finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.954" offset="13959999">It was not affirmed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.173" offset="13968881">The court did not reach that issue in the Ninth Circuit appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.942" offset="13979957">And as Judge Jones said in the Sixth Circuit, the fact that the government has stipulated that this is a tax-exempt church means under the regulations that only an insubstantial amount of its function can be devoted to a non-exempt purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.504" offset="14058220">So that there is, the stipulation itself means that commercialism is irrelevant here, it's insubstantial by definition, by stipulation And that's why Judge Jones said that the finding of the tax court that this court operates in a commercial fashion is irrelevant and not controlling.</text>
