            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133566">We'll hear argument first this morning on No. 87-1428, Patricia Lorance v. AT&amp;T Technologies.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.028" offset="173586">Mr. Goldstein, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="12.669" stopTime="171.233">
            <label>Mr. Barry L. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="12.669" offset="184139">Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.292" offset="198663">The question presented by this case is may a female worker file a timely charge from the operation of a selection practice designed to discriminate against female workers when that operation causes her job demotion, as the company and the union intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.386" offset="275045">This record dramatically presents this issue because AT&amp;T and Local 1942 conspired to change the seniority system to advantage male workers over female workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.494" offset="331470">In 1982 the Petitioners were demoted to lower-paying jobs by the operation of this discriminatory seniority system, while males with less seniority remained in the higher-paying jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.552" offset="387685">Within 300 days, within the time requirement required by Title VII, the Petitioners filed charges that their Title VII rights had been violated by the operation of this discriminatory seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.020" offset="441602">Nevertheless, the lower court granted summary judgment against Petitioners since the Petitioners did not file within 300 days of first becoming subject to the discriminatory system in 1979 and 1980, although the system at that time did not operate to cause them to lose their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.865" offset="521014">Both Petitioners and Respondents argue that the lower court erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.309" offset="542748">I shall describe three reasons, based upon the projected operation of the three rules, the rules proposed by Petitioners and Respondents and the rule adopted by the Seventh Circuit as to why the Petitioners' rule is the only one consistent with the objective of Title VII to end discriminatory employment practices and the only rule consistent with the efficient judicial administration of the Fair Employment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.965" offset="645357">First, let me turn to the opportunity to challenge discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.267" offset="666568">Petitioners' rule is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.631" offset="676077">It would permit a member of a class of intended victims of a plan to discriminate to sue, as here, when they are harmed by the implementation of that discriminatory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.897" offset="721112">Petitioners' rule follows from this Court's unanimous decision in Bazemore that the pay practice at issue in Bazemore was illegal even though,</text>
            <text syncTime="157.976" offset="765416">"It is a mere continuation of the pre-1965 discriminatory pay structure. "</text>
            <text syncTime="163.860" offset="788926">Similarly, the implementation of the discriminatorily designed seniority system is an unlawful employment practice.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="171.233" offset="818497">Excuse me, but in Bazemore the violation was not the establishment of the pay structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.658" offset="852142">I mean, that was not what the plaintiff had to prove in order to make the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.192" offset="870324">All the plaintiff had to prove was a difference in pay, not that it was established discriminatorily.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.349" offset="898954">Justice Scalia, I don't think it's quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.190" offset="914314">I think in Bazemore the plaintiff had to prove, and did prove, that there was a difference in pay and that difference in pay was the result of a discriminatorily designed pay structure established prior to 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.590" offset="983904">It was the two parts, it was the continuation... as the Court said, the mere continuation of the discriminatory pay structure into the time period, as well as the fact that it had been established with a discriminatory intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.544" offset="1059659">In fact, the lower court had approved the... well, had said that the pay structure was not discriminatory because, as the lower court said and the Supreme Court credited, the system had been operated in good faith from 1965 through the 1970s when it was challenged.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.188" offset="3046219">And if there was one layoff, one woman was laid off who was senior to junior males, then even though you couldn't show through the statistical study that women as a class were being adversely affected, that... that person would be entitled to relief under a discriminatory treatment theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.192" offset="3130333">The plan old argument that there was a discriminatory plan that was established to harm women; it harmed a specific woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.868" offset="3165024">There is a second type of case in which I agree with your question in which there is a practice set up, such as a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.114" offset="3205984">It operates to have a discriminatory effect, which is established statistically.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.618" offset="3223956">At the point the plaintiffs show there is this practice, it has a discriminatory consequence.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.025" offset="3881615">But that the statute of limitations was not draw on the labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.990" offset="3909514">In fact, the legislative history is just to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.662" offset="3920172">In 1972 when Title VII... when the limitations period was extended from 90 to 180 days, 180 days being the same period under the labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.876" offset="3961027">When Congress did it in the Conference Committee Report just before the bill was voted on in both the House and the Senate, the Conference Committee said that it was the intent to have an unlawful employment practice be counted from the last occurrence rather than the first occurrence of a discriminatory practice, and to provide the maximum benefit of law to the victims of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.897" offset="4081086">That is the difference with the labor law, which was focused specifically on the collective bargaining process and not on providing individual rights to the victims of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.937" offset="4141272">In fact, Title VII... one of the reasons for Title VII was that the labor laws unfortunately had not worked to prevent discrimination in the workplace.</text>

            <label>Mr. David W. Carpenter</label>
            <text syncTime="1675.167" offset="6834183">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.712" offset="6868351">The one point of agreement in this case, I think, is that under Delaware State College v. Ricks, the determination of the timeliness of a Title VII claim requires a court to identify precisely the unfair employment practice of which the plaintiffs complain, and the 300-day limitation period is keyed to the date of that event and not to consequences, future consequences, of the event that are not themselves discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.922" offset="6981200">EEOC and Petitioners are simply refusing to face up to the consequences of this rule and the statutory policy against litigating stale claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.387" offset="7023101">Here the entire basis for Petitioners' complaint is their charge that we acted for discriminatory reasons when we took away certain plant-wide seniority rights in the 1979 collective bargaining agreement and adopted the tester system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.567" offset="7083809">If their allegations were true, the taking away of those rights could have been challenged in 1979, and the system would have been enjoined then and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.244" offset="7126441">By contrast, what Plaintiffs have alleged within the limitations period in 1982 are simply nondiscriminatory consequences of the 1979 changeover to the tester system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.665" offset="7184224">This system on its face is perfectly valid and it's the kind of system that employers and unions can adopt for perfectly legitimate reasons any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.851" offset="7228946">And Plaintiffs have not alleged that the system was discriminatorily administered or maintained during the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.384" offset="7255068">The 1982 gown... downgrades, it's conceded, were required by the terms of this collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.123" offset="7289968">There was an undisputed lack of work, and Petitioners were the low persons on the seniority totem pole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.175" offset="7314209">Down... the downgrades were for that reason, not their sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.078" offset="7329778">And under Section 703(b) that is not unlawful discrimination, and it's not unlawful discrimination even if it's correct that the system had a disparate... the downgrades had a disparate impact on women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.356" offset="7382964">This is just like Ricks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.528" offset="7391636">The claim there was time-barred because the discharge was the nondiscriminatory consequence of the denial at tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.062" offset="7421729">And the denial of tenure couldn't be challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.764" offset="7432596">Similarly, when the downgrades were because of low seniority, then... here they're most nondiscriminatory consequences of the '79 changeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.439" offset="7467287">And to litigate our motive... our motive... in 1979 and threaten to dismantle a system that's operated and has been administered nondiscriminatorily for years would epitomize the kind of litigation that the statute of limitations is designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.279" offset="7530608">Now, Petitioners' proposed way around Ricks is their argument that if the initial adoption of the system was discriminatorily motivated, then each subsequent application of it is a continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.299" offset="7586719">And that theory was rejected by the Court's 1960 decision in Machinists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.023" offset="7609602">As Justice Scalia alluded to, the critical thing there is that if it had been established that the union lacked majority support at the time the system was adopted, then each subsequent act of enforcing it would have been a continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.112" offset="7669997">But the Court said that challenges to the enforcement are suable unfair labor practices only during the six months statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.519" offset="7707613">They said it would destroy the stability of bargaining relationships and lead to the litigation... and produce litigation of stale claims if neutral systems, neutral on their face, can be a challenge on the basis of events outside the limitations period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2238.516" offset="9087610">The distinction of Machinists that Petitioners and EEOC make in their briefs is that the challenge there was to the method of execution of the collective bargaining agreement and that there was some error in the execution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.340" offset="9166918">But that is just incorrect because if the employer... if the union lacked a majority, it's unlawful discrimination and a violation of Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA for an employer to force an employee to join a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.270" offset="9226582">So, in both Machinists and this case, the claim is that a facially neutral provision of the collective bargaining agreement is unlawfully discriminate... discriminatory in violation of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.286" offset="9274647">And this isn't just the language in the Machinists case; it's the holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.219" offset="9290425">So, the only possible answer to Machinists is Petitioners' suggestion that Title VII statute of limitations should be interpreted different... should be interpreted differently than the NLRA's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.058" offset="9345700">But this Court explicitly stated in Zipes v. TWA that the time limitations under Title VII should be treated likewise as under the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.416" offset="9387182">And it refers to the legislative history of the '72 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.568" offset="9407767">And the fact is that these are both labor statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.111" offset="9729909">But if it were discriminatory on its face, if it classified employees on the basis of race or sex or some other statutorily-prohibited criterion, then you wouldn't have these staleness problems because you'd be looking at the criteria that were in fact applied during the limitations period.</text>

            <label>Mr. David W. Carpenter</label>
            <text syncTime="2423.839" offset="9828861">Yes, and that's the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.701" offset="9836279">That's exactly the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.031" offset="9841608">And, you know, apart from the NLRA cases, you know, we think Evans and Ricks simply follow the same methodology as Machinists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.949" offset="9889360">If you have neutral and otherwise lawful conduct within the limitations period, it can't be challenged solely on the basis of events outside the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.564" offset="9923737">Contrary to the EEOC's argument, we don't think the decision in Ricks rested in any way on the fact that the discharge was the inevitable consequence of denial of tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.774" offset="9976609">The point there was that if you litigated the denial of tenure outside the limitations period, you'd have staleness problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.018" offset="10001582">We submit the result would have been the same if Ricks had been allowed to continue to work as a non-tenured faculty member and there had been some change in the economy and all non-tenured faculty members had been fired five years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.304" offset="10050693">At that point, it would be inconsistent with the purpose of the limitations period to allow Ricks to come in and challenge the denial of tenure five years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.800" offset="10084756">The Bazemore case, which is the principal case on which our opponents rely, doesn't have anything to do with this case because that's a situation where blacks were paid less than whites for the same work during the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.949" offset="10145360">What that case establishes is that when there is a current violation, it's actionable, even if past violations weren't also challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.465" offset="10179424">Here there is no current violation alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.289" offset="10190709">And, moreover, in view of this Court's decision in Florida v. Long of last June, I think it's a reading of... an overly-broad reading of Bazemore that would somehow sweep in this case... it's clearly foreclosed because Long indicates that even some current violations of Title VII can't be enjoined when they would retroactively upset reasonable reliance interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.606" offset="10295930">And that's the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.116" offset="10301990">When a facially valid seniority system is adopted and not challenged within 300 days, and then nondiscriminatorily administered, employers and employees alike reasonably change their position in all sorts of fundamental ways in reliance on the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.267" offset="10374611">To allow a challenge to that system to be brought years, decades, later would upset those reliance interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.474" offset="10411391">Really, the ultimate question here is whether this is a case challenging a seniority system on the grounds that it's not entitled to protection under 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.171" offset="10458203">And the ultimate question here is whether there is any basis in the statute for exempting 703(h) challenges from the statute of limitations of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.037" offset="10497700">And it couldn't be clearer that Congress intended no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.650" offset="10512119">Section 706(e)'s limitation period applies to all claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.113" offset="10533958">There is no exception there for challenges to seniority systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.826" offset="10548795">And to exempt challenges to seniority systems from the limitations period would be absolutely irreconcilable with the purposes of 703(h)... 703(h) was part of the Mansfield-Dirksen compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.397" offset="10611071">It was the quid pro quo for the inclusion of Title VII in the '64 Civil Riqhts Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.180" offset="10634268">The whole reason for 703(h) is that Congress recognized that seniority is of critical importance in collective bargaining, and it's of critical importance to workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.948" offset="10681288">The whole purpose was to assure that Title VII wouldn't destroy the reliance interests that are built up around the routine and nondiscriminatory administration of neutral seniority systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.025" offset="10733638">A rule that permits these systems to be challenged and dismantled after they've operated for years or decades, as their rule would, is absolutely irreconcilable with that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.114" offset="10777942">And for that reason, we submit that the lower court's decision to dismiss this case was absolutely correct and that it should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.921" offset="10821200">If there's no further questions, I'll submit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2680.635" offset="10856100">Justice White is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.496" offset="10863519">The seniority system itself must illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.629" offset="10876057">And that was the distinction made in Machinists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.492" offset="10899463">Even if Machinists applied, which we don't accept, the court there said that evidence during the time-barred period could be used to illuminate the practice that occurred during the period within the time limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.163" offset="10954216">In Machinists the system itself, the clause itself, was not challenged as discriminatory, as opposed to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.137" offset="10978039">The system itself is being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.348" offset="10986921">That is precisely what the Court... how the Court approached seniority issues in Teamsters and Patterson, and, in fact in Bazemore distinguished Evans by saying that the plaintiff had made no allegation that the seniority system itself was intentionally designed to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.087" offset="11053899">Implying, of course, as in Bazemore, that if the allegation of intentional discrimination in the design had been made, then the charge would have been timely in Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.713" offset="11088381">That, of course, is the allegation that we have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.946" offset="11097262">In conclusion, I would... I think Judge Cudahy in his dissent summed up the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.310" offset="11118787">It's a simple case, as he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.819" offset="11124743">The plaintiffs filed complaints at the time they were injured by demotion in the way the Defendants allegedly intended them to be injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.515" offset="11151597">Viewed in that direct and uncluttered fashion, their complaints are timely.</text>
