            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="112065">We'll hear argument next in No. 87-7023, Tyrone Hardin v. Dennis Straub.</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas Ryan Mullkoff</label>
            <text syncTime="14.573" offset="170266">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.900" offset="187611">The question in this case is whether a federal court hearing a state prisoner's Section 1983 claim must apply that state's prisoner tolling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.722" offset="230870">We claim that the tolling statute must apply in light of this Court's previous decisions and in light of the plain language of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.734" offset="266919">The record below in this case is scant.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.514" offset="282070">In 1986, Petitioner Hardin filed a Section 1983 action claiming a due process violation by a Michigan prison official who ignored Michigan Department of Correction rules which required a hearing be held before he could be confined in a solitary segregation unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.304" offset="353227">Almost six months were spent in segregation without any hearing, much of the time in his cell 24 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.271" offset="381126">This segregation ended in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.940" offset="395755">The federal lawsuit was filed in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.548" offset="410174">The district court below dismissed this case sua sponte prior to service on the defendant finding that it was barred by Michigan's three-year general statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.825" offset="459285">Petitioner argued on appeal to the Sixth Circuit that the statute of limitations was tolled under Michigan statute of limitations law since there is a particular Michigan tolling provision which allows an inmate whose cause of action accrues during imprisonment until one year after the imprisonment ends to file any civil suit which has accrued during that imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.751" offset="563043">The Sixth Circuit rejected this argument and said that the Michigan statute of limitation tolling rule for prisoners does not apply to Section 1983 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.326" offset="605361">We believe that the Sixth Circuit was wrong and should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.058" offset="620199">The particular tolling rule in question was rewritten by the Michigan legislature in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.947" offset="655830">It was amended from a five-year tolling period after incarceration ended to a one-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="680803">It was reviewed again in 1981 by the Michigan legislature and upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.769" offset="703059">This Court has made unambiguous pronouncements on the use of state statute of limitations tolling law.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.281" offset="733152">In Tomanio, a 1980... 1980 decision of this Court, you said that federal courts hearing actions under Section 1983 must borrow the relevant state statute of limitation and tolling rules unless they're inconsistent with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.150" offset="800653">In Chardon v. Fumero Soto in 1983, this Court said that application of interrelated tolling rules, when state statute of limitations law is borrowed, are appropriate and must... must be used in that manner unless they're inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.345" offset="873378">This Court has in total since 1980 reviewed the application of specific state limitation statutes to civil rights cases six times.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.935" offset="915801">That body of law has established that state statute of limitations and their interrelated tolling rules must be applied unless the state statute interferes with or unduly burdens assertion of the civil rights claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.881" offset="979539">The Michigan tolling rule in question here does not interfere with assertion of Section 1983 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.205" offset="1012872">In fact, it's our position that it accommodates Section 1983 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.798" offset="1031157">Borrowing a state's tolling rules is... is the rule; not borrowing would be an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.404" offset="1061668">And under the procedural statute which applies to Section 1983, that being 1988, it must be borrowed unless inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.478" offset="1101897">The central issue raised by the Respondent is that Michigan's tolling rule is inconsistent with Section 1983 because it does not foster deterrence of official misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.551" offset="1158217">I'd first like to point out that this Court in Felder v. Casey last year said that compensation is the primary goal of Section 1983, the central objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.654" offset="1210671">Compensation is well-served by a rule which extends a victim's time to file a civil rights claim, like the rule in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.181" offset="1248705">To date, this Court has not rejected any state law which made access to the courts easier for persons who claim to be victims of civil rights violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.616" offset="1286426">The second objective, deterrence, is not interfered with or impeded by a statute of limitations tolling rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.705" offset="1330834">Our position is that the greater period of time a victim has to file, the greater the deterrence... the deterrent effect will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.076" offset="1364271">If we believe that giving prisoners access to court will actually deter Section 1983 claims, then it only follows that giving greater access to prisoners will foster greater deterrence.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.351" offset="1445459">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.443" offset="1449743">We disagree with the idea that you can deter official misconduct, that... that it is not possible to deter official misconduct with a tolling provision or a lengthy period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.608" offset="1510452">Respondents argue that promptness and a promptly filed claim fosters deterrence and that the opposite is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.261" offset="1541067">We... we don't believe that that necessarily follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.870" offset="1559458">In criminal law, for instance, tolling provisions are used in statute of limitations systems using criminal codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.319" offset="1597283">It wouldn't be argued that we should abandon statute of limitations tolling provisions in criminal law because it wouldn't foster deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.346" offset="1637407">I think the opposite is more persuasive, that the greater the period of time for bringing charges, the greater the deterrent effect would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.171" offset="1664679">Presumably the greatest deterrence in a civil rights case occurs when a victim prevails in a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.777" offset="1703131">We think that there are other reasons based on this Court's past decisions which should support our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.835" offset="1739389">The Congress has made clear in Section 1988 that it was willing to rely on a state's judgment regarding statute of limitations law.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.816" offset="1783275">The concept of federalism would be supported by applying Michigan's tolling law.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.204" offset="1812845">The State of Michigan has considered and reconsidered this law written and rewritten the law, and the Michigan Court of Appeals has reviewed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.496" offset="1854014">In 1981 there was a constitutional challenge to this particular tolling law, and the Michigan Court of Appeals found it to be supported by valid governmental interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.241" offset="1896960">Respecting the legislature's wishes here would promote federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.365" offset="1917440">It isn't disputed that the Michigan courts would apply this tolling law to a civil rights claim were it brought in their courts.</text>

Mr. Mullkoff, when the legislature revisited the tolling statute, was there any discussion or anything in the reports, if there are reports in Michigan, that dealt with... there's a seeming incongruity where the person is in solitary confinement and claims to be wrongfully there, and he presumably isn't there by the time he brings his action.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.612" offset="2258494">The committee said, nonetheless, we still think that restrictions obviously exist and that it would be prudent to leave a one-year window.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.031" offset="2296111">That was the legislature's comment in that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.403" offset="2313665">A final point I think that should be made is that statute of limitations provisions and their tolling exceptions have to be read and viewed in context.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.129" offset="2548558">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.548" offset="2578233">Although the statutes of limitations and their tolling rules are part of the judicial process, the state legislatures do not design their statutes of limitations and tolling provisions with the national interest in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.293" offset="2633195">When statutes of limitations are borrowed from the state pursuant to 1988, as here, the courts must determine whether they are inconsistent with the national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.225" offset="2672901">Although the federal courts in Michigan have not looked with disfavor upon the policy of repose of the state, the Sixth Circuit... they have... they have rejected, however, the open-ended tolling statute with the Sixth Circuit approval as being inconsistent with the underlying remedial policies and purposes of the Civil Rights Act which are identified as both deterrence and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.622" offset="2786481">The Sixth Circuit decided the case based on Higley, which is an earlier decision by the Sixth Circuit, in which they placed a strong emphasis on the court's perceived substantive policy of early enforcement of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.537" offset="2850116">The court reasoned that because deterrence of the civil rights violation is the Act's objective... one of the Act's objectives, such claims should not be allowed to long... languish long after the best opportunity for resolution and deterrence is past.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.859" offset="2911451">And I also suggest to the Court that compensation in and of itself has a deterrent effect in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.496" offset="2937992">The court considered this perception of early resolution not in light of fixed tolling statutes such as six, eight or ten years, but rather under a tolling statute allowing varying claim viability periods that are dependent upon... upon claimant prisoner's duration of sentence, which in some cases could extend for decades, and found it unacceptable in view of its perceived need for prompt enforcement of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.094" offset="3052408">Now, the Petitioner asserts the longer the statute of limitations, the greater the deterrent value.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.591" offset="3074351">while it may be true that permitting litigation of stale claims has a more... has more deterrent value than prohibiting them, it cannot be realistically denied nor... and it's equally true that prompt litigation increases the likelihood of success and deterrence.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.540" offset="3286152">In other words, they'd have to determine whether the interest in protecting the claim for a 15-year period is outweighed by the federal policy of repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.097" offset="3328365">And if it's 15 years, it's... it's a value judgment--</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.992" offset="5747931">But 1988 is the section of the Civil Rights Act I have reference to which requires the deterrence to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.771" offset="5775098">Now, as I say, in some of these cases... it might be interesting to point out too in connection with the statute of limitations, and... there are 26 states that have no tolling provision for prisoners, and there are 10 states that have a limited, fixed tolling provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.091" offset="5856392">There are 14 states that have tolling provisions open-ended like that of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.526" offset="5874155">What I suggest here is that the court looked at the problem realistically and acted reasonably by limiting the prisoner Section 1983 claim to Michigan's three-year residual personal injury statute and ask that that decision be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.910" offset="5935699">I've not made any reference in my argument to access to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.347" offset="5953358">Access to the courts was never raised in the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.386" offset="6021590">And I suggest that that disability really does not exist because since the decision in Bounds v. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.399" offset="6053564">And also I call the Court's attention to considering the Civil Rights Attorney Award Fee Act of 1976 that became codified into 42 U.S.C. 1988 which this Court said in Hensley v. Eckart insures effective access to the... to the judicial process for persons with civil rights grievances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.695" offset="6210821">Brief rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.836" offset="6219389">We disagree with the Respondent's contention that there is a federal policy of repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.644" offset="6262543">Repose is a purpose of statutes of limitations systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.219" offset="6284904">Congress hasn't enacted a statute of limitations system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.046" offset="6296189">They can if they choose to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.716" offset="6310922">Statute of limitations issues have been deferred in 1983 cases to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.683" offset="6334746">That's Congress' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.557" offset="6342269">Repose is a state interest, not a federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.306" offset="6353241">It can't be fairly characterized as one of the purposes of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.741" offset="6378945">Virtually all of the reasons urged for affirmance by Mr. Caruso would require the Court to undertake a state-by-state, case-by-case review of tolling statutes to see if the statutes conflict with the purpose of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.391" offset="6445609">We believe that this Court, through its decisions in Okura in January of 1988 and in Wilson v. Garcia, has moved in the opposite direction to simplify the rules relating to application of a statute of limitations to avoid that unnecessary litigation on collateral matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.992" offset="6520006">We urge the Court to continue this policy approach set out in Wilson and Okura and to reverse the lower courts.</text>
