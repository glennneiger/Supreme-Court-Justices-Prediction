            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="124208">We'll hear argument next in No. 87-56, Owens and Lessard v. Okure.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.366" offset="161615">Mr. Schiff, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="peter_h_schiff" startTime="60.621" stopTime="563.199">
            <label>Mr. Peter H. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="60.621" offset="366624">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.403" offset="381775">The Respondent in this case alleged that he was battered and beaten by the Petitioners during an arrest on the campus at the State University of New York in Albany in January of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.674" offset="442902">This suit was filed 22 months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.665" offset="458784">Petitioners moved to dismiss on the grounds of the statute of limitations contending that a one-year statute of limitations should have been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.174" offset="508835">Both the District Court and the Second Circuit rejected our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.910" offset="535793">The case came up here presumably because of the conflict with the Eleventh, Sixth and Fifth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.692" offset="562961">I might mention that prior to the time that he filed this suit, Respondent had sought recovery from... in the New York Court of Claims based on a 1983 action against the State, but that was dismissed because 1983 actions did not lie against the State in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.458" offset="653971">The basic issue here is how to apply the principles that this Court announced in Wilson/Garcia in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.702" offset="690961">Respondent also argues that if the Court rules in Petitioners' favor, that the decision should be applied prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.651" offset="742788">I intend first to discuss the merits of which statute of limitations should be borrowed and then will argue that the decision should not be applied prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.049" offset="788345">In... in Wilson, this Court decided that a single statute of limitations should be borrowed under Section 1988 for each state for purposes of 1983 cases, and that the proper choice would be a personal injury statute of limitations of general applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.068" offset="900463">Wilson involved the State of New Mexico which has only one such personal injury statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.404" offset="941736">Now, in the course of its decision in Wilson, the Court rejected two other possible statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.739" offset="975068">One was the one relating to remedies for wrongs committed by public officials and that was viewed as inconsistent with the purposes of 1983 since one of the very purposes of the Act was that the state remedies were insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.874" offset="1055630">And the other statute of limitations considered were for suits arising under statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.399" offset="1089798">But the Court pointed out that back in 1871 when 19... Section 1983 was enacted as Section 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act, that there were few such claims, such statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.481" offset="1154059">The difficulty has arisen since Wilson because more than half the states, including New York, have more than one personal injury statute of limitations that are generally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.927" offset="1199826">And it is our position that the statute of limitations, consistent with Wilson, should be used as the one applies to intentional personal torts, at least particularly those that encompass assault, battery and false imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.773" offset="1295225">Now, the reason we make this argument is that, as the Court explained in Wilson, the very catalyst of the Ku Klux Klan Act was the campaign of violence and deception in the South that had been fomented by the Klan which was denying decent citizens their political and civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.198" offset="1380907">Now, that was being accomplished by the Klan through acts of violence, whippings, shootings, murders and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.934" offset="1415911">And it is for this reason that three of the circuits, initially Judge Johnson in the Eleventh Circuit, concluded that the logic was that therefore the personal injury statute of limitations which dealt with those subject matters was the most appropriate to be borrowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.287" offset="1489263">Now, our opponents suggest in their brief that the... Section 1 of the Klan Act was not directed against violations by the clansmen themselves, but rather against... suits against the local and state officials who were not coping with the reign of terror being perpetrated by the Klan.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.443" offset="1593961">That argument assumes that everyone sued under 1983 must be a state official.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.030" offset="1640250">That simply isn't true under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.802" offset="1651326">To be sure, there is a need that the action be under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.225" offset="1673060">But this Court's decisions in Annex v. Cress, 1970; Dennis v. Sparks, 1980, have made it clear that it is enough that the defendant be a willful participant in joint action with the state or its agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.999" offset="1756130">Private persons jointly engaged with state officials in a challenged action are, indeed, acting under color of law for Section 1983 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.409" offset="1809837">And this would be true, as the Court explained in the Dennis case, even if the state actor who provides the basis for the action himself or herself might be immune from suit such as a judge, prosecutor, law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.151" offset="1888727">Now, this Court recognized in Annex that state involvement might result from the police intentionally tolerating violence directed at those seeking to assert their civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.251" offset="1949122">And that's exactly the kind of situation that we think Congress did envision in 1871 when it enacted the Ku Klux Klan Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.197" offset="1992904">The Klan was then viewed by the Republican supporters of the Act as a group designed to aid the Democratic Party and to deter the supporters of that party, both black and white, from voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.747" offset="2059150">And the... excuse me... there are references in the debates, which have been discussed by this Court on numerous occasions, to persist in discriminatory refusals, to enforce the laws by state officials in some parts of the postbellum South.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.578" offset="2174507">This showed a belief that the Klan was acting with the deliberate acceptance of local law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.204" offset="2208988">Indeed, the Congressional Record... Congressional Globe showed the belief that the Klan was acting in collusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.281" offset="2257263">There were signals passed between members of the Klan and law enforcement officials with people in the jury box and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.774" offset="2283281">So, we believe that there is every reason to believe that Section 1 of the Klan Act, Section 1983, certainly viewed by the Congress in 1871 as one tool to be used to permit suits with respect to the violent acts of the Klan members themselves.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="563.199" offset="2376904">What does that have to do with the present time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_h_schiff" startTime="567.883" stopTime="970.127">
            <label>Mr. Peter H. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="567.883" offset="2395712">Well, we think that the analysis of this Court in Wilson was in large measure a historic analysis not totally, but in large measure a historic analysis as which would be the most appropriate statute to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.173" offset="2452868">The 1983 actions essentially are all or mostly intentional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.587" offset="2486513">Now, they're not all violent torts, but they certainly mostly involve intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.401" offset="2509710">There are still some open questions as to whether wanton misconduct or perhaps a high level of negligence... and certainly simple negligence is not sufficient for a 1983 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.400" offset="2565717">So, we think that the historical context shows a... the reason why where there's more than one personal injury statute of limitations in the state, that the state... that the one that should be chosen is the one that does relate to the kind of acts that were being considered back in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.704" offset="2650980">We... Respondents argue in their brief that our position would result in further litigation because of alleged difficulties in choosing among intentional tort statutes in states where there is more than one such statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.021" offset="2748260">We think that the contention... the assertion of confusion is really not well-founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.617" offset="2790579">Indeed, their own Appendix A to their brief, which lays out the various statutes of limitations, shows that in general where there is more than one, the reason for being more than one is that there's a separate statute of limitations, usually shorter, for libel and slander.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.270" offset="2865184">Now, it's pretty clear that this history I've just recounted simply doesn't provide a basis for picking libel and slander statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.046" offset="2900293">It's the ones that involve the more assault directed torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.681" offset="2926833">The... I'd also point out that looking at the New York statute of limitations, which is not atypical, that if you choose a statute for which they contend, the one that essentially applies to all personal injury statute... has a... all personal injuries other than those listed in other statutes, which includes a series of other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.031" offset="3056296">There's a separate one for malpractice and then the intentional tort and some other ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.136" offset="3080747">But the bulk of those actions brought under that statute of limitations would relate to negligence actions, product liability cases, the very types of cases that this Court has indicated simply would not give rise to a 1983 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.738" offset="3155144">It would be really quite anomalous to pick the negligence statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.553" offset="3186386">Respondents also make an argument historically that the division that we have made is allegedly inconsistent with the way statutes of limitations reviewed at that time, referring to a text of Professor Prosser, among others... we think that their discussion there between direct and indirect force kind of torts, while interesting historically, wasn't even valid by 1871 as Prosser's text itself shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.581" offset="3362451">And, indeed, if one looks at Appendix B in their brief, it will appear that the kind of dichotomy between assault, battery, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and so forth and other kind of personal injuries, the kind that is... exists in today's statute, was pretty much true at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.715" offset="3439042">The Second Circuit seemed to... seemed to hold and our Respondents argue that a one-year statute of limitations is inconsistent with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.295" offset="3505289">Now, we think there's absolutely no merit to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.258" offset="3521171">This Court, as far as I can read the cases, has never decided inconsistency of a state statute of limitations solely on the basis of the length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.118" offset="3572580">It has looked... as in the Burnett v. Grattan case, it has rejected a state statute of limitations on a functional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.023" offset="3608211">There that related to administrative discrimination proceedings, and the Maryland statute is not directed to general litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.371" offset="3661606">So, that was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.593" offset="3666517">However, it is of interest that three of the Justices of this Court in Burnett in a concurring opinion pointed to the one-year statute of limitations that relates to Section 1986, which was Section 7 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which does include a one-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.918" offset="3767872">And the concurring opinion noted that one year would certainly be appropriate for 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.683" offset="3802876">And we think that is surely true since the kind of proceedings are not that different.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.050" offset="3832342">The type of evidence that needs to be obtained in the great bulk of the cases is not materially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.363" offset="3861599">We also think it's important that there... a one-year statute of limitations has been recognized as being appropriate in many 1983 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.710" offset="3906948">And, of course, four jurisdictions, including California, apply a one-year statute of limitations to personal injuries generally so that any determination that one year was somehow inconsistent would pose serious problems as to the applicability of Wilson to those... those states.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="970.127" offset="4004646">Mr.... Mr. Schiff, it may work well in New York where it's easy enough, as you say, although I guess there's some contest on the point, to pick out what is the... the intentional tort statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.500" offset="4070161">But I don't know how such a line would... would play in... in other states where you may have a general personal injury statute, but then one statute for a few personal torts, another statute for a few others, another statute for still a few others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.210" offset="4137034">This isn't the kind of an issue I'm anxious to have a lot of litigation about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.381" offset="4149677">Why shouldn't we have a... a clear line?</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.231" offset="4157096">And it seems to me the general personal injury statute is a... is a clearer line than what you're urging upon us, maybe not clearer in... any clearer in New York State, but we're talking about all the courts having to apply this in 50 states and with changing statutes in 50 states over the years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.715" offset="4230970">Well, our position is that the... the line that should be chosen is... is not solely to try to determine whether a statute applies to all intentional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.362" offset="4277573">Our position is that the one that should be chosen in a state... and I think it's not too difficult if when you do examine this appendix... is the one that encompasses assault, battery and false imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.218" offset="4321041">Now, that... that... there is one that includes that plus others in at least 24 of the jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.223" offset="4340998">Now, our opponents suggest, well, there would be difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.874" offset="4355627">Look at Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.946" offset="4359911">But Alabama is a case where the Eleventh Circuit already determined that the intent... which intentional tort statute should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.901" offset="4395751">I... I think the debate below as to whether New York statute was general or... or not general is somewhat misconceived and... because however you look at it, the New York statute admittedly covers the... the important personal intentional torts in... in view of the history of the Klan Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.543" offset="4706295">It's not broken down language-wise in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.236" offset="4721132">I should add in finishing the previous question that I don't think it's clear that you have a simple solution if you decide to pick so-called general personal injury statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.166" offset="4788841">I believe Justice O'Connor pointed out in her dissent in Wilson that the Tenth Circuit... again, the case arising from Colorado... I don't quite remember the name... Mishmash or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.096" offset="4856551">The Court did not choose either personal injury statute, but chose one that applied residually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.871" offset="4891659">And as I say, one of the difficulties with applying a... the general personal injury statute that you would be picking a statute that essentially is covering torts that would not possibly give rise to 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.774" offset="4963235">And we don't have good statistics, but there are statistics listed in the appendix to the District Court opinion in the Hobson case in the District of Columbia, which is cited in our... in Respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.147" offset="5036796">And if you look at the actual statistics that Judge Oberdorfer had developed in the District of Columbia, I suggest that it shows... that there isn't a great deal left of the suits although it's not entirely easy to tell if you carve out the negligence and product liability cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.310" offset="5117357">I'd like to turn to the issue of whether the decision here should be applied prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.051" offset="5172319">It is our position that since this Court would be making a new decision as to the appropriate statute of limitations to be chosen, that the principle described by this Court in Stovall v. Denno in 388 U.S. should apply, and that since this Court only decides concrete cases, it would have to apply the decision here to this case because otherwise there would be no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.040" offset="5292273">The last term there were two cases involving the statute of limitations under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.916" offset="5327800">Those decisions are perfectly consistent with our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.858" offset="5343578">In Goodman v. Lukens Steel, the statute of limitations was applied retroactively, but not necessarily on this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.587" offset="5402510">However, the reason in that case at least or the facts in that case show that the statute of limitations would not have been fully dispositive of the case, but it simply determined the length of time for which damages would be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.489" offset="5474086">There was also injunctive relief so that there was a concrete case regardless of what the decision was in the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.476" offset="5506059">The other case is St. Francis College.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.809" offset="5527375">That case... both of those cases, Goodman and St. Francis College, both came from the Third Circuit, a... but they were decided in reverse order by this Court from the way they were decided by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.390" offset="5597697">In the Third Circuit... the Third Circuit had first decided that the personal injury statute of limitations should apply to 1983 actions in Goodman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.449" offset="5653912">Then the St. Francis College case came along, and they said we are now applying the Goodman rule to a later case and therefore Chevron Oil v. Huson applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.646" offset="5702709">And that certainly was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.679" offset="5722876">But when it got to this Court, this Court simply assumed for the purpose of St. Francis that... that the personal injury statute would apply and it wasn't... didn't make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.562" offset="5790376">So, it applied the same principle and it actually decided the merits of the 19... 1981 statute of limitations and the later Goodman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.050" offset="5836352">In these circumstances, neither of those cases in any way departs from our view that the decision here should be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.185" offset="5884939">Unless you have further questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.292" offset="5917331">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.312" offset="5981384">What Petitioners seek here will undermine everything that this Court sought to accomplish in Wilson v. Garcia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.026" offset="6016283">The explicit motivating purpose of the Wilson decision was to provide some uniformity and provide some certainty to the question of the statutes of limitations under 1983 actions and therefore avoid unnecessary and time consuming litigation in 1983 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.703" offset="6110951">At that time, the lower courts followed a myriad of different practices in determining the appropriate state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.959" offset="6139999">Some courts looked at the specific factual allegations in a complaint and tried to match them with state common law and statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.245" offset="6185139">Other courts took a particular statute of limitations and said this applies in all 1983 claims, but these decisions varied from panel to panel and from circuit to circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.204" offset="6232995">What Petitioners seek here will recreate that type of unnecessary and time-consuming litigation because there is not but one statute of limitations that covers intentional torts, but two in 32 or 33 states that we've looked at and put in our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.396" offset="6313766">And there is no clear, bright line to deciding among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.640" offset="6330693">In New York, for example, if a prisoner has an Eighth Amendment claim against a prison doctor, do you use the two and a half year statute of limitations that applies for personal injury claimants against doctors, or do you use the one-year provision that applies to certain specific torts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.952" offset="6403940">Well, if... if you go along and say, well, chose the one that... that specifies intentional torts, what do you do in Alabama where there's a six-year provision that specifies three intentional torts and a two-year provision that specifies three or more intentional torts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.654" offset="6474784">And it's not simply a question of choosing which covers the most for in Alabama and in other states, often they're equally divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.220" offset="6509057">And if you're going to go to most, how do you count them?</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.391" offset="6517730">In... in Arizona, for example, there is a general provision that covers assault and battery, as there is in Texas, but it doesn't specify it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.521" offset="7566285">--Well, I'm not sure that that's the... but if... that's not my reading of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.726" offset="7587078">But, nevertheless, the... the content and... and the use of intent in most constitutional settings has no relationship to its use in intentional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.753" offset="7639219">And it's... and it really is a question of statutory interpretation... excuse me... statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.157" offset="7664819">And if you look back at 1871 and you look back at the statutes of limitations in effect at that time, you see that they retained a lot of their English roots in that they were divided between statutes of limitations that covered trespass claims, assault, battery and false imprisonment and statutes of limitations that covered action on a case, which were the general personal injury provisions of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.017" offset="7784250">And the difference between trespass and action on the case is not the difference between intent and non-intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.743" offset="7811104">Rather, it's the difference between direct, physical force, which is a trespass, and indirect injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.627" offset="7842660">One of the classic examples that the courts used and continue to use to describe that difference is a situation where someone throws a log onto the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.263" offset="7881217">If you're hit by that log, you have a claim for trespass because it's a direct, physical force injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.958" offset="7911937">If you come along the highway later and trip over it, you have an action on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.304" offset="7933357">And if you look at... at what was at issue in... in 1871, it wasn't these tortuous acts of the Klan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.330" offset="7969511">Yes, they were the catalyst, but what they were trying to do was to insure that the state provided an adequate and effective remedy for these Klan acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.765" offset="8011202">And if the... if the state failed to do that, that would be an indirect injury because there would be no direct, physical force so that the current day descendants of the trespass provisions are the intentional tort provisions, and the current day provisions of the action on the case are... are the general provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.001" offset="8100123">And I think it's significant that at that time they... in Section 1986, they referred to action on the case as the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.095" offset="8136486">Section 1986... it was passed as part of this package, the Sherman Amendment... covers the situation where a state or local government is aware of some purported Klan activity, is capable of doing something to stop it, and takes no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.076" offset="8200433">The person who is injured by that Klan action can then sue that state or local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.409" offset="8221749">And Congress specified action on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.660" offset="8230840">And this is a parallel type of remedy, although much more limited in scope than 1983, but it's in recognition that Congress was thinking in these terms and therefore the present day descendants of those provisions... the action... excuse me... the general remedy for... for personal injuries are the ones that Congress would have designated at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.697" offset="8330941">And not only are... are these provisions the most analogous, but they're the most appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.560" offset="8350376">And appropriateness, as this Court defined in Burnett v. Grattan, means that a statute of limitations must take into account the goals and policies underlying Section 1983 and as well take into account the practicalities of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.522" offset="8414219">And Congress in 1871 was seeking a broad and effective remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.315" offset="8437416">It was a unique remedy, one... one that didn't exist and they wanted to ensure that the rights under the Bill of Rights passed on to... to everyone through the Fourteenth Amendment were being enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.522" offset="8486213">It would be totally inappropriate and totally inconsistent to attach that broad remedy to some truncated statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.228" offset="8521112">The... if you look at New York's statutory scheme, for example, you see that there's a one-year provision for some of these specified intentional torts, a three-year provision for the general remedy for personal injury, a three-year provision for civil rights claims against state actors, and a six-year provision for certain constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.544" offset="8614317">That's New York's own view of the... of the relative importance of those different types of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.418" offset="8637828">This... this Court has pointed out that statutes of limitations are a weighing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.850" offset="8659561">What is a legislature's interest in the vindication of a certain claim as opposed to the interests and repose?</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.395" offset="8685788">And that array represents New York's interest, and it shows that these kinds of intentional torts are at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.431" offset="8713896">Well, certainly Congress in 1871 didn't view these as the least important of its remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.566" offset="8738451">This was the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.844" offset="8743571">This is the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.555" offset="8750363">This is the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.118" offset="8756632">And if anybody should have a right to vindicate that, it should... it should be--</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.295" offset="8865302">That's what the state legislature said in 1960 when it reduced this intentional tort statute of limitations from two years to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.191" offset="8900933">And... and it goes also to this Burton v. Grattan equation or standard for appropriateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.837" offset="8935519">What is the question about whether or not it takes into account the practicalities of litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.802" offset="8967388">We know from this Court's decision in Felder v. Casey last term that in due process and equal protection claims, which are, after all, the heart of 1983 and the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment what... which... which it was enforcing these kinds of claims, often there is a lag time between the actual injury and the time that the person who has been injured recognizes that he has a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.550" offset="9070311">That's just not consistent with what New York feels about its intentional torts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2483.483" offset="10058053">I think... I think that... that you've gone far down the road to certainty and uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.389" offset="10093684">Yes, there may be subsequent questions as to whether or not a one-year provision is consistent or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.332" offset="10121478">We know that... that in New York the Court of Appeals held in 1981 that anything less than two years would not be consistent and based that two-year cutoff on the fact that the Federal Tort Claims Act provides that in two years you have... you have two years to file an administrative charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.865" offset="10203607">It would certainly be... to my mind, it doesn't make any sense to say to somebody, if you get hit by a mail truck, you have two years to file an administrative charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.955" offset="10255957">But if your First Amendment rights are violated, that claim gets extinguished in one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.226" offset="10273093">That doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.360" offset="10281557">That's inconsistent it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2563.035" offset="10376329">And I don't have to tell you the names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.888" offset="10383748">But they came out of the Senate Judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.259" offset="10393152">But the... the... the... the... the one-year provision I think the fact that it was attached to Section 1986, the most controversial provision of this legislation, one in which the sponsor of that legislation, Senator Thurmond and his chief opponent, Senator Thurmond, both concurred after it had gone through this amendment process, one of which was the attachment of this truncated statutory period, that it wasn't worth the paper it's written on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.960" offset="10516032">And if you look probably back in... in... in the annotations, there are very, very few 1986 cases ever been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.174" offset="10548841">And I think there's substantial basis to reject it, but again I don't think you have to reach that question here, obviously, because here you have a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.612" offset="10594608">And the choice is between a general personal injury provision and a specified intentional tort provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.917" offset="10627836">And I think the guidance that this Court provided in Wilson was to choose the one that generally covered personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.142" offset="10652704">After all, we're not just talking about one type of constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.648" offset="10674752">We're talking about a broad range of claims that... that are covered by 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.103" offset="10700561">The previous case, the Texas Monthly case... what kind of intentional tort is involved there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.775" offset="10719264">The... the... to... to try to pin that down to, as Justice Scalia suggested, to assault and battery makes no sense, but to try to say that it covers personal injury generally I think makes a lot of sense and it... and it does accomplish primarily what this Court sought to accomplish in Wilson v. Garcia which was to put an end to this litigation by giving some uniformity and some certainty to that decision, a uniformity and certainty that's consistent with the purposes of 1983 and consistent with the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.417" offset="10865864">If the Court has no further questions, I thank you for your attention.</text>
