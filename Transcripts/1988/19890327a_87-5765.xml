            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="191794">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.343" offset="206945">The issue in this case is whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of the death penalty on a juvenile who was 17 at the time of committing a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.281" offset="242681">One point of agreement for all members of the Court in Thompson v. Oklahoma is that there is some age below which a juvenile's crime can never be punished by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.721" offset="280506">Thus, the issue in this case is not whether a line should be drawn specifying a minimum age for the death penalty, but where the line should be drawn, and the Petitioner submits that the line should be drawn at the age of 18 because it is the most objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.183" offset="342364">It is the most justifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.583" offset="347902">It is the most logical line that's capable of resolving the issue presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.503" offset="367650">As the briefs in... filed in this case indicate, 18 is a very conservative age for determination as to when a person attains full maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.358" offset="411014">Indeed, the maturation process is a continuing one that lasts until a person is into their early to mid 20s.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank W. Heft, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="79.333" offset="458870">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.433" offset="463363">You're absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.216" offset="466498">As human beings, we are simply incapable of making infallible judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.356" offset="495023">Consequently, our society and the legal system are imperfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.808" offset="508816">Yet, in striving for perfection and in order to ensure fundamental fairness in the operation of our criminal justice system, jurisprudence in capital cases has consistently demanded certainty and reliability not only in capital sentencing procedures and trials, but in the outcome as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.734" offset="576526">However, a constitutionally acceptable degree of reliability and certainty cannot be attained in a case in which the state seeks the execution of a person who is under the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.958" offset="625427">The uncertainty about when a particular juvenile has fully developed and has fully evolved into an adult has caused society to draw a bright line.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.016" offset="669626">That line is an expression of society's confidence and society's certainty that those under the age of 18 do not possess an adult's level of emotional, intellectual and cognitive development.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.109" offset="726050">And it is because of the uncertainty as to when a child actually evolves into an adult that society has drawn this bright line; the boundary has been drawn because of this uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.666" offset="772235">The uncertainty extends not only in matters as everyday life, such as voting rights or the right to sit on a jury, but certainly it extends to the area of capital punishment and sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.141" offset="822181">Eighteen is that point in a person's life where society feels comfortable and confident in assuming that one is ready to assume the privileges, rights and responsibilities of adulthood.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.164" offset="862201">The failure of the Court to set 18 as the minimum age for the imposition of capital punishment puts society in a position it has sought to avoid, and that is of making an error in determining when a child has actually evolved into an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.840" offset="920924">That risk of error we submit is simply intolerable in a capital case especially where society has chosen to err, if it does so, on the side of caution by creating a boundary between childhood and adulthood.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.116" offset="974005">We simply cannot attain a sufficient level of constitutional certainty and reliability in death penalty cases unless 18 is established as a minimum age for imposition of the death penalty and thereby eliminate the risk that a child who has not evolved into an adult is exposed to capital punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.782" offset="1176715">And you're quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.818" offset="1184865">There is an element of arbitrariness in any type of line-drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.686" offset="1200330">It's unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.503" offset="1203569">But as the Court noted in Salom v. Helm, that line-drawing is a problematical issue, it's a difficult issue, but it is one that exists in Eighth Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.709" offset="1240454">And it seems to me that notwithstanding any arbitrariness, it's a justifiable arbitrariness and it's a permissible arbitrariness because society has made that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.565" offset="1279846">It has drawn that line in so many other aspects of our lives because the person who is 17 years old, 11 months and 364 days cannot vote under any circumstances, but a person who is 18 years old and one day can vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.080" offset="1481930">Whereas, here you're talking about the situation where a jury in every case, in fact, even before the jury, you... you have to have a judge say that this juvenile can be tried as an adult.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.590" offset="1535951">Then afterwards, a jury can consider the individual characteristics of this person and can say, even though this person is only 17 years and nine months, we think this person is mature enough to be held liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.818" offset="1808878">First of all, the primary safeguard against arbitrary imposition of capital... of capital punishment is the introduction of mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.257" offset="1842628">But here, as I have pointed out in the brief, that safeguard was... was hollow because mitigating evidence was excluded unjustifiably.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.344" offset="1874916">And the mitigating evidence that I'm talking about is testimony from a... inmate on Kentucky's death row about rehabilitation programs within the adult criminal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.052" offset="1917757">He not only knew about that information, but he had personal experience with the Petitioner before this crime occurred and after this crime occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.575" offset="1951925">Surely that is relevant mitigating evidence, but the jury wasn't allowed to hear that.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.943" offset="1969375">Not only that, as I... as I've pointed out in the brief, youth as a mitigating circumstance under Kentucky's death penalty statute is also a hollow safeguard because it operates on a sliding scale insofar as it protects an individual... theoretically protects an individual who is 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.238" offset="2034576">It is also protects an individual who is 30.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.267" offset="4370655">Neither can we... we be certain as human beings that the level of maturity experienced by a particular juvenile or exhibited by a particular juvenile is commensurate with that of an adult.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.844" offset="4532927">And those restrictions are a manifestation that society has substantial doubt that a person who is under 18 has actually evolved into an adult because a person under the age of 18 simply has not lived long enough for society to be certain that it is dealing with the completed individual or the finished product of the maturation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.258" offset="4622579">And that's consistent with Eighth Amendment jurisprudence that requires the Court to consider the dignity of man because society must be certain if capital punishment is to be imposed that it is dealing with the finished product of the maturation process, a fully evolved and mature adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.302" offset="4690811">We can't reach that level of certainty in Juvenile cases because of the age barrier or the... the dividing line between childhood and adulthood.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederic J. Cowan</label>
            <text syncTime="1774.631" offset="7240153">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.189" offset="7282367">What is at stake in this case before the Court today is this Court's long-established jurisprudence of individualized consideration in matters of death penalty cases focusing on the nature of the crime aria the personal culpability of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.901" offset="7357182">To accept Petitioner's point of view, this Court would have to accept the notion that suddenly at age 18 individuals become sophisticated, nature and responsible as adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.577" offset="7411935">Not only does that notion fly in the face of common sense, it also flies in the face of a national consensus that does exist which is that individuals mature and grow at different rates depending upon who they are and what their individual circumstances are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.253" offset="7478599">The Petitioner would have this Court draw a line, a bright line, that would exempt categorically all individuals in a certain class depending upon one factor, namely, chronological age that is not related or not directly or necessarily related to the individual culpability of the particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.702" offset="7564385">This case that is before the Court today shows what a mistake it would be to shift the focus of jurisprudence away from individual culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.908" offset="7605241">Kevin Stanford committed these crimes with deliberateness and intention, with purposefulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.645" offset="7632199">His motive was to eliminate a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.747" offset="7640558">He was mature and sophisticated enough to sodomize and terrorize a young woman, calm and calculated enough to allow her to smoke a cigarette before executing her, and calm enough to return to the scene of the crime and steal some 300 cartons of cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.709" offset="7708372">In addition, the trial judge in fact, after hearing all the evidence and considering all the circumstances before the court, made a finding... and this at joint appendix page 111... that this individual was beyond rehabilitation whether in or outside of an institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1974.280" offset="8038664">In fact, in this particular case, the individual was in a treatment program just prior to the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.033" offset="8065727">There was testimony in the record in the... in the hearing process that some 86 percent of the people who went through that program were successfully treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.289" offset="8102717">He was one of the 14 percent apparently who was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.924" offset="8113270">To rely on an age alone... a bright line of age alone, is unlike this Court's previous decisions in Enmund v. Florida, Tison v. Arizona where, for example, the culpability... the question was based upon the personal culpability as it related to the individual's participation in that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.321" offset="8194877">Age in itself is an imperfect proxy, if you will, or a symbol of factors that are more important such as maturation, sophistication, ability to appreciate the seriousness of the crime, and the consequences of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.080" offset="8253913">We all know as a matter of common experience that maturity exists on both sides of that line and sophistication exists on both sides of that bright line the Petitioner wishes to draw.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.841" offset="8424963">Your Honor, I think there is no... there's nothing that I am aware of that indicates one way or another as far as the deterrent value separating juveniles from adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.097" offset="8454011">I would only say to you that if there is a deterrent value, I see no reason why it would not apply to juveniles as well as to adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.453" offset="8491419">In particular, in this case you had a... you had a juvenile who was street wise, who had been in and out of the criminal justice system for a number of years who was capable of making the kinds of national decisions that he made in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.176" offset="8542305">I believe it's important to avoid in thinking about these problems the notion of stereotypes and thinking about the average 17 year old or the average 16 year old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.318" offset="8586818">What we are talking about here is the juvenile such as the one who is before us who was, in fact, the most sophisticated, who had been... had seen the various aspects of the criminal justice system, who acted with the kind of deliberation and performed the kinds of acts that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.880" offset="8657139">Another thing I think is important to think about in determining whether a bright line is a good test is to consider that if that test is developed, it seems to me that you're writing into the Constitution a principle that will guarantee injustice, and by that I mean take the example of two individuals who both commit jointly a crime, a murder, one 17, one 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.847" offset="8761002">Let us suppose that the 18 year old is unquestionably less culpable than the 17 year old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.251" offset="8786602">He didn't pull the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.703" offset="8792349">He didn't plan the crime, but he was there in such a way as to exhibit the extreme indifference to human life as in Tison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.273" offset="8818681">The Petitioner would have this Court say that the 17 year old shall be exempt, the clearly more culpable of the two, and the 18 year old will be, in fact, put to death even though he is clearly less culpable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.497" offset="8871552">Or compare... and I would suggest to you that a case like that will present itself to this Court if a bright line is drawn, and the opponents of the death penalty will be before you asking you to rule out the capital punishment for the older one on the grounds that it is freakish and arbitrary to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.059" offset="8941874">Compare this case Stanford versus Tison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.030" offset="8957757">Can we say with any degree of assurance, if we have a bright line, that the type of culpability exhibited by Stanford is less than that... or excuse me... is... is less than that exhibited by the Tison brothers in their particular case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.188" offset="9014390">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.205" offset="9018361">Or take Jose Hyde, the original case that was before this Court, the... someone who was thought to be 17 from Georgia and then it was discovered that, no, he was perhaps 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.645" offset="9060157">Is today he any different now just because the fact happened to be discovered?</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.299" offset="9078756">Is the crime any different?</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.715" offset="9084398">Is his degree of culpability any different because now he is eligible for the death penalty and under Petitioner's point of view would not be?</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.238" offset="9114491">Your Honor, as legislatures... legislatures can draw lines like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.559" offset="9135807">They can draw such lines for reasons of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.677" offset="9148346">They can draw such lines for whatever reason they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.129" offset="9162139">They may wish to exhibit mercy, and that is fine and that is wise and acceptable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.434" offset="9599324">But even assuming that it was correct, I think that... that in this particular case we are talking about significant differences because in... as you recall, in Thompson v.

            <text syncTime="2381.811" offset="9668810">Here we have six states cut of 18 that have explicitly addressed the question where the line has been drawn below the age of 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.549" offset="9699739">In addition, Your Honor, one of the points that was very clear... clearly made in the plurality of the Thompson case by Justice Stevens was the fact that there was no state that treated 15 year olds other than initially in the juvenile process, in the juvenile jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.629" offset="9776121">That is not true with respect to 17 year olds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.846" offset="9992937">Your Honor, it's a little bit complicated, but let we explain very briefly, if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.584" offset="10015925">At the time of the commission of this offense, Kentucky had no explicit minimum in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.106" offset="10049988">This was in 1981 that the offense was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.975" offset="10065453">At that time, the only effective statute on the books was KRS 208.17C which is the juvenile transfer statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.914" offset="10101293">In that statute, Your Honor, the statute very explicitly sets out that Individuals under the age of 16 who committed capital offenses... and it used the word "capital offenses"... may be waived to adult court if other factors are considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.975" offset="10173495">Five... Section 5(c) of that statute also explicitly says that once the trial judge... having had the case waived to him, once the trial judge refuses to send it back to juvenile court, then the case will proceed against that... that individual as against any other defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.789" offset="10248728">Quite clearly, Kentucky in that statute alone demonstrated its awareness that it, in fact, it was dealing with capital offenders under the age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.979" offset="10293554">And, of course, we're talking about one that's 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.614" offset="10300032">At that time, also Kentucky, to be quite clear with you and quite... quite candid, Kentucky had adopted in 1980 the Unified Juvenile Code, delayed its effective date until 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.238" offset="10350501">In that code, it said that there would be an 18 year old minimum for... for juvenile death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.594" offset="10383938">That was delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.046" offset="10389789">The 1982 general assembly deferred it until 1984, and it was only in 1986 with an effective date in 1987 that Kentucky adopted a minimum age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.735" offset="10436496">But Kentucky now has the minimum age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.270" offset="10446632">At the time of the commission of the offense, there was no effective minimum in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.258" offset="10470664">In discussing consensus analysis in trying to determine what is the best approach to determining what societal values are, the Court it seems to me has to be quite cautious in trying to reach that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.671" offset="10544225">The Constitution shall not catch a pendulum at one and of its swing and freeze that notion into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.158" offset="10574214">The attitude in this society about youth is very such in a state of flux and has been for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.847" offset="10604934">And we see movement in the various legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.549" offset="10615801">It is commonplace I think to... to hear people say youth are growing up so much faster today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.702" offset="10644431">They're so such more sophisticated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.071" offset="10649864">They're exposed to so many more types of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.106" offset="10661985">And I think common experience tell us that that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.475" offset="10675464">Under Gregg v. Georgia, the Petitioner has a heavy burden to demonstrate that there is a national consensus against the execution of 17 year olds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.748" offset="10712558">As I have pointed out, six out of the 18 states that expressly have expressed... have... have expressly drawn a line have done so at 17 or below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.056" offset="10757802">Eighteen other states allow on their face for the execution of those under the age of 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.126" offset="10786119">I believe these 18 should be counted in determining a national consensus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.828" offset="10800852">But even if one were to follow the type of analysis in the plurality in Thompson or the concurrence in Thompson, I think that we have to realize that significant evidence relating to the interpretation of those 18 states' statute has been overlooked because they do, as in Kentucky's case that was in effect then explicitly recognized the notion of capital offense in those juvenile transfer statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.061" offset="10905864">When we talk about... when we talk about consensus, we do have to at some point go beyond mere counting, and I think the Court has to consider what the particular nature of the crime... nature of the punishment is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.905" offset="10973156">And it seems to me that punishment should be something that is patently offensive to the national conscience or so revolting or abhorrent or such an aberration that we can comfortably say that it is cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.330" offset="11030939">If you take, for example, a case of... suppose we had a felony limit that was set in order to be tried as a felony, and every state in the Union had $300 set as the minimum for someone to be tried as a felony, but one state had $100... so it was 49 to 1... then surely It would not be unconstitutional for that one state to express... to have that $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.981" offset="11129472">We must recognize in... In doing consensus analysis, recognize the notion of federalism that is central to our... central to our constitutional scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.103" offset="11173985">As was noted by Justice O'Connor in Tennessee v. Garner, the Eighth Amendment is not violated every time a state reaches a conclusion different from the majority of its sisters over how best to administer its criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.097" offset="11226021">The Petitioner's bright line analysis I believe is further flawed, and I think these are some of the comments that Justice Scalia was getting to when looking at the question of eligibility for juries or eligibility for voting, these sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.141" offset="11294148">I might point out, of course, that there is at least one very distinct age that we know that is virtually nationwide... I think nationwide now, and that's 21 years old in order to purchase alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.449" offset="11343363">But the point is that all these things are passed depending upon what the particular bars or what the particular circumstance is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.055" offset="11377845">And as Justice Scalia noted, they are done for a purpose of administrative convenience, the 18 year olds for voting and driving and... and this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.411" offset="11415252">It would be best I think for all of us if we can make an individualized determination for voting, for serving on a grand jury, whatever it happens to be, as to who was really mature enough and sophisticated enough to be able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.218" offset="11466452">But clearly the transaction costs of that are too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.087" offset="11477946">But the criminal justice system... the very premise of the criminal justice system is based upon an individualized consideration of each individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.626" offset="11512114">That's what it's set up for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.843" offset="11516921">That's what it is capable of doing, and that's what it should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.911" offset="11529250">And that's why we ask that it be continued in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.882" offset="11545133">And I might add particularly... and this Court has recognized... in dealing with problems of crimes and punishment we're dealing with an entirely different matter than we are in dealing with things like juries... serving or a jury and voting and whatnot.</text>
