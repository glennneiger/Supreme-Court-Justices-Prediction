            <text syncTime="10.356" offset="187115">Mr. Sherwood, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="13.058" offset="197877">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.891" offset="209267">To paraphrase the district court, the gravamen of a complaint in this case, is that the State University of New York, we call it SUNY, has refused to permit American Future Systems, a company that markets pots, pans, cutlery, and dishes, to conduct product demonstrations in campus dormitory rooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.589" offset="295993">The Respondents have a radically different view of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.458" offset="311562">They argue that this case concerns the pure speech rights of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.695" offset="332460">But the Second Circuit, like the district court, concluded that the only speech involved in this case, is constitutionally subordinate commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.551" offset="371853">However, in evaluating the commercial speech involved here, the Second Circuit made a critically important error.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.324" offset="399020">Today, I want to spend a minute, laying out our position, and then, I plan to discuss why the Second Circuit decision must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.013" offset="437786">We maintain that the challenge regulations, designated SUNY Resolution 66-156, does nothing more than prohibit the operation of... for-profit commercial enterprise on SUNY campuses and that it is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.641" offset="508212">We believe, that if the Second Circuit had simply, properly applied the standards of review for restrictions on commercial speech, it would have sustained the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.164" offset="550321">And, even if it was disinclined to sustain the regulation, on that basis, it should have sustained it as a permissible time, place, and manner restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.972" offset="597551">We, of course, adhere to the other reasons set forth in our brief, for sustaining the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.157" offset="1030348">I should say though, that with respect to these examples, the case here involved and focused on, simply, efforts by American Future Systems to put on product demonstrations in dormitory rooms.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.912" offset="1465339">The third has to do with the fact that this... the challenge regulation here involves conduct, not simply speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.565" offset="1491984">And, in Oklahoma and Broderick, that was a... where you got that kind of circumstance, overbreadth does not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.360" offset="1567112">And then, this Court said, just last term, in the New York State Club Association's case, you would have to have a showing from the text of the regulations an actual fact of a substantial number of instances existing, in which the regulation cannot be applied constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.821" offset="1637015">I don't think that we have that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.190" offset="1646419">Otherwise, what this Court would do, and what courts are obliged to do, is to solve those potential, extended applications of a regulation on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.914" offset="1693335">The students in this case... that challenged this regulation, never once, asserted any other interest here, other than the fact that they wanted to host, or listen to, demonstrations by American Future Systems.</text>
