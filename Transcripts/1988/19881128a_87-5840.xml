            <text syncTime="696.561" offset="2925288">I would point out, however, that when the second appeal case, the Court of Appeal invited additional argument on the significance of the involvement of state action, and the county responded that all constitutional issues concerning that and the need for a finding of unfitness to terminate the parental rights had been squarely presented to the California Supreme Court; the California Court of Appeal agreed that the constitutional issues, state action and others had been foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.051" offset="3067186">That's in the opinion of that court, and we are in the situation where the county has also conceded here at page 10 of the brief for Appellee that those issues were raised and considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.244" offset="3127999">So we would submit that, though it's not artfully stated with chapter and verse, that it was a necessary part of the judgment, and it was obvious that that's what they were intending to do is uphold it against all those claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.760" offset="3214098">I mean, at most you can argue they happened to address the point, but it wasn't necessary for them to address it if you had never raised it.</text>

            <text syncTime="778.881" offset="3254536">It is perhaps necessarily included in their broad statement that the statute as interpreted passes muster under the Fourteenth Amendment and this Court's cases applying it to unwed fathers' illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.308" offset="3316289">I would point out as to the various issues before the Court that Mr. McNamara was easily identified and established as the father of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.818" offset="3374281">He was named on the birth certificate, he was found, he claimed paternity, he was stipulated to be the father, and he was adjudged the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.156" offset="3411688">So many of the issues that might come up in other cases are not presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.477" offset="3436975">We are addressed only with the situation where the father was known and identified, the mother has relinquished for adoption, the father then came forward, asked to be the full parent, offered to take and requested full parental responsibility and was denied any opportunity to form a relationship with the child and was denied any protected liberty interest by the California courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.314" offset="3660270">The classification of presumed fathers is treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.801" offset="3682212">The presumed father is one who has married the mother, who has attempted to marry the mother by going through a ceremony which might be void or voidable, or whom the mother has let take the child into his home, and he receives it into his family and holds it out as his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.346" offset="3752430">We contend that as against both mothers and the presumed fathers under the statute, that Mr. McNamara has a protected interest under this Court's cases and is entitled to equal protection with both of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.528" offset="6373138">First I would like to address the issue what does the 1984 decision of the California Supreme Court actually hold with regard to these federal constitutional issues, and I think in all candor we have to say that the decision and the discussion in that case is not as precise as we would have liked it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.429" offset="6472717">However, we do believe that it certainly hit the substantive due process issue head on and that it did conclude that the California statutory scheme did not violate federal--</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.794" offset="6570206">--Yes, that also baffles us a little bit because if you look at his opening brief, the argument is, of course, that Edward has a protected liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.839" offset="6642408">He cites all the cases that are traditionally discussed in substantive due process cases, and on page 21 of that brief he says termination of parental rights interferes with a "fundamental liberty interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.198" offset="6703848">So as you will note from the brief that we filed, we talk about substantive due process and we talk about equal protection, but from our vantage point there's no question in our mind that the California Supreme Court dealt with the substantive due process issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.548" offset="6793187">With respect to the equal protection issue, again, Footnote 8 is the only place that you really find any discussion of equal protection, and as has been pointed out, that's in a quotation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.640" offset="6853582">And the purpose of the quotation is to set the stage for the last paragraph of the footnote, which simply concludes: Because we have ruled that the New York statute is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause, we similarly express no view as to whether a state is constitutionally barred... it's not a substantive discussion of equal protection at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.369" offset="6932472">The point of it, if you go back to the text to see what the footnote is for, is to establish, is to establish that Caban, like Stanley, involved biological fathers who had established strong ties and held them out as their own.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.621" offset="7041455">In looking at the decision as phrased by the California Supreme Court, we were of the view that in citing Caban, which is solely an equal protection case out of this Court, that the Court was considering that case and therefore, under the more general rule that raised and decided that the California Supreme Court in 1984 had attempted to decide both federal constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.140" offset="7159528">However, as the Court knows, we have also raised the jurisdictional issue of finality, that this Court lacks jurisdiction because in 1984 the Appellant should have proceeded to seek review in this Court at that time since all federal constitutional issues had been raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.968" offset="12166888">And in that respect, looking at the test used by this Court in Craig v. Boren, where the classification serves an important governmental objective, which in this case would be speedy and stable placements of newborn children, we believe the classification is substantially related to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.899" offset="12254660">And if I might just quote from Justice Stevens in the Caban case, the reasons for the substantial relationship, only the other carries the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.724" offset="12305964">It is she who has the constitutional right to decide whether to bear it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.676" offset="12325713">These differences continue at birth and immediately thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.997" offset="12342954">During that period, the mother and child are together, the mother's identity is known with certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.251" offset="12368031">The father, on the other hand, may or may not be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.103" offset="12383391">These natural differences between unmarried fathers and mothers make it probable that the mother and not the father or both parents will have custody of the newborn infant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.178" offset="12431770">And that's the way it was in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.529" offset="12441174">Justice Stevens continued, but as a matter of equal protection analysis, it is perfectly obvious that at the time and immediately after a child is born out of wedlock, differences between men and women justify some differential treatment of the mother and father in the adoption process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.043" offset="12527169">Most particularly, these differences justify a rule that gives the mother of the newborn infant the exclusive right to consent to its adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.001" offset="12566980">In Lehr, this Court made the... states the same rule, equal protection does not prevent a state from according the two parents different legal rights if a parent has never established a custodial, personal or financial relationship with a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.962" offset="12642839">The fundamental point we're making is that biology in and of itself does not create any substantial relationship or create a protected relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.786" offset="12698115">There must be something substantial between the father and the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.007" offset="12719012">Absent that, the classification is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.911" offset="12738657">And it is on this point that I think the Appellant misconceives the role of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.081" offset="12771362">This Court is not to sit as an intermediate state appellate court to review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the determination of the trial court as to who should have custody of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.574" offset="12829354">The issue before this Court is whether or not the unwed father classification meets constitutional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.882" offset="12874493">We submit that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.251" offset="12880031">I'd like to make a point with respect to what is the remedy that the Appellant seeks in this case, because quite frankly, he has never made it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.891" offset="12934575">On page 3 of his reply brief, he says that it is the termination of rights of the father proceeding is set aside, no adoption will be permissible without his consent, and he will be able to seek custody, visitation, pay support and be a full participant in Katie's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.888" offset="13010539">On the other hand, on page 4 he states it is not likely that Edward will get custody, and why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.161" offset="13047633">In all candor, I think it's for the same reasons that he did not get custody in the trial court: the best interests of the child are such that custody should remain with the Moses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.901" offset="13098624">So if we are down to the point where visitation is the only remedy that he is seeking, that again is subject to the requirements of Section 4600 of the Civil Code, which is the detriment/best interests of the child standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.215" offset="13175842">So even that type of action by the father is subject to the same statutory standard that this termination proceeding was subject to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.988" offset="13218996">With respect to the substantive due process argument, again, McNamara ignores the fact that he did have an opportunity to establish a relationship with his child under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.786" offset="13310111">We again refer to 7006(c) of the Civil Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.222" offset="13623894">The paradox in the situation under California law is that to get a hearing, Mr. McNamara had to come under Section 7017, seek to establish his paternity by filing a 7006 petition, which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.767" offset="13702052">That argument was never raised below, and California found that procedures had been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.754" offset="13722010">So he had to come in, seek to take full custody, become a parent, act like a father, take full responsibility, and yet, he's cut out by that statutory scheme and treated as one who had no interest in his child at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.847" offset="13786376">That would be another sort of natural father.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.667" offset="13801736">What we are asking the Court to do is determine that Mr. McNamara's parental rights should not be terminated except on the same grounds as the mother or the presumed father, unfitness, neglect or abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.059" offset="13859205">That will result in a new trial to see if those grounds may be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.879" offset="13878536">On the basis of this record, they cannot be because he is a good and loving father and always has been.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.222" offset="13939871">Mr. McNamara would have the right to seek custody, perhaps not now but perhaps sometime in the future, he would have the right to try for visitation, he would have the right to establish a lifelong relationship, all subject to the trial facts and the supervision of the California courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.969" offset="14018866">The main points raised to justify the disparate treatment are supposed effects upon adoptions and upon unwed mothers in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.995" offset="14078947">We submit that that is speculative, there is no proof offered that there would be those adverse consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.334" offset="14108309">It doesn't seem to bother Texas, Illinois or Wisconsin which require the same grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.236" offset="14127953">It doesn't bother the commissioners on uniform laws and the Uniform Parentage Act, Section 4 when they become a presumed father merely by filing an affidavit of paternity, which is not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.463" offset="14180825">San Diego County, according to the newspapers, its current administration under these circumstances would give custody to the father subject to change, but it does indicate that all these adverse consequences don't come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.722" offset="14245922">It doesn't bother California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.424" offset="14252714">The delay, the possible placement with the father all arise now because the statutory scheme requires notice and a hearing so that the father might get custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.713" offset="14297853">It didn't bother the California Supreme Court which found no policy reason, no factual reason nor any legal reason to deny parental rights, terminate parental rights at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.123" offset="14351457">If merely placing the child with prospective adoptive parents or foster parents is going to become determinative of these issues, then agencies may act with impunity because the courts will take time, there is certainly some delay even pendente lite litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.553" offset="14437243">This trial as done in about three or four months, which is pretty fast, but there's still delay that they complain of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.559" offset="14465246">So that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.096" offset="14491368">It was started, a petition was put up in August and the trial went in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.617" offset="14517491">So that there simply is, we submit, no basis for the differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.822" offset="14558346">No important state interest is served, certainly no compelling state interest is served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.376" offset="14576528">Again, state interest is to find a good home, and Mr. McNamara offered one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.196" offset="14599829">He offered one well within the time the state thought he should do so.</text>
