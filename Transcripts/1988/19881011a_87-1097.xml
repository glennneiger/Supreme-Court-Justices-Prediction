            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142676">We will hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1097, Otis R. Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.997" offset="182591">Mr. Lazarus, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_j_lazarus" startTime="13.027" stopTime="61.633">
            <label>Mr. Richard J. Lazarus</label>
            <text syncTime="13.027" offset="194712">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.900" offset="222193">This case concerns the authority of a Federal agency to promulgate a retroactive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.475" offset="244554">Our position can be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.880" offset="254167">A retroactive rule is generally valid unless the agency's decision to impose the rule retroactively is arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.643" offset="285200">Unlike the D.C. Circuit, we do not believe that the Administrative Procedure Act bars virtually all retroactive rules regardless of their reasonableness, nor do we believe that the Medicare Act prohibits all retroactive cost limit rules in every circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.026" offset="346745">Instead, in our view, retroactive cost limit rules are valid in two different ways under the Medicare Act, each sufficient by itself to support the rule struck down by the lower court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="61.633" stopTime="74.048">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="61.633" offset="389167">Mr. Lazarus, I guess if we were to find that the Medicare Act itself prohibits retroactive rulemaking in this instance we wouldn't have to go on and reach the APA question, would we?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_j_lazarus" startTime="74.048" stopTime="108.426">
            <label>Mr. Richard J. Lazarus</label>
            <text syncTime="74.048" offset="438800">Technically the Court would not have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.907" offset="446219">We would urge the Court to address both questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.141" offset="459176">The Administrative Procedure Act issue is by far the more important issue decided by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.310" offset="479865">The D.C. Circuit is the most important circuit for administrative law questions, and it was decided by that court, and there's no reason why the Court logically has to address one rather than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.494" offset="524586">So the Court technically does not have to, but we would urge the Court to, and for the reasons in our brief, present, we don't absolutely think the Medicare Act itself does prohibit such rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.051" offset="562829">The retroactive rule challenged in this case--</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="108.426" offset="576309">But still, the answer to Justice O'Connor's question is in the affirmative.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_j_lazarus" startTime="114.860" stopTime="200.076">
            <label>Mr. Richard J. Lazarus</label>
            <text syncTime="114.860" offset="602013">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.875" offset="606088">The Court does not have to, we would urge the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.764" offset="617687">The retroactive rule challenged in this case finds its genesis in the 1981 determination of the Secretary to make a wholly prospective change in the Medicare Act cost limit rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.245" offset="659587">At the time relevant to this litigation, the Medicare Act allowed for reimbursement of providers of health services for the reasonable costs of their services to Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.194" offset="699398">To that end, the Act authorized the Secretary to promulgate cost limit rules based on the estimates of the costs necessary for the efficient delivery of health services.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.408" offset="736283">In 1981, the Secretary determined that his then-existing rule regarding wage costs promulgated in 1979 required adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.733" offset="777556">The database upon which that rule was based did not accurately reflect differences in wage costs in different parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.839" offset="809948">As a result the rule unfairly disadvantaged certain providers in certain geographic areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.540" offset="832831">Those providers were receiving inadequate reimbursement under the Medicare Act while other providers were receiving excessive reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.647" offset="861252">Because the Secretary considered the modifications necessary in the database to be of a minor technical nature, he published the final revised rule without first providing for public notice and comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.861" offset="910049">Respondents filed suit, and in 1983 a Federal district court invalidated the 1981 rule on procedural grounds.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="200.076" offset="942963">Mr. Lazarus, before you go further with the facts, I presume that the Secretary could have amended the rule in such a fashion as to eliminate the unfair disadvantage without eliminating what he regarded as the unfair advantage, in which case there would have been nobody to challenge the retroactive rule.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_j_lazarus" startTime="219.584" stopTime="223.864">
            <label>Mr. Richard J. Lazarus</label>
            <text syncTime="219.584" offset="1020913">The Secretary could have approached it all kinds of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.302" offset="1035855">The question is--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="223.864" offset="1038049">Well, I mean, you mentioned that it unfairly disadvantaged some people and unfairly advantaged others.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.001" offset="1058634">All we're really fighting about here are the people that you assert it unfairly advantaged, because you could have taken care of the people that it unfairly disadvantaged.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.386" offset="1112132">They would suggest that any kind of retroactivity, and if the Secretary is without authority to make any kind of retroactive changes they would have been, in other words confined to the 1979 rule, the Secretary should have assigned recoupment from the others.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.538" offset="1168766">But the Secretary could have issued the rule eliminating the unfair disadvantage, not the unfair advantage, and there would have been no one to challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.119" offset="1283078">--Well, I think we're actually fighting about, about both, particularly to the extent that we're dealing with the broader questions of the Secretary's authority in the future to promulgate retroactive rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.396" offset="1324247">If the Secretary in the future decides that he is incapable of promulgating a retroactive rule, then other providers in this case who relied justifiably on the 1979 rule would, I think, not have redress, and instead the Secretary would have had to seek recoupment against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.010" offset="1438663">The District Court invalidated the rule concluding, the 1981 rule, that the APA required prior notice and comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.256" offset="1471682">The District Court, however, specifically declined respondents' request that it order the Secretary to reimburse them pursuant to the 1979 prior rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.749" offset="4489660">But we believe that Congress, when it delegates general rulemaking authority to an agency, it includes the authority in discreet circumstances to deal with, to impose retroactive rules, knowing that the kinds of concerns that one has with retroactivity can be addressed through the arbitrary and capricious review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.037" offset="4570745">In the general rulemaking provision of the Medicare Act, Congress gave the Secretary full power to promulgate rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.813" offset="4609928">We think that it's essentially full legislative power, which would include in certain very discreet circumstances retroactive rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.529" offset="4636782">We're not saying that all retroactive rules are valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.825" offset="4649948">We're not saying that all retroactive cost limit rules are valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.918" offset="4662278">All we're asking for is an opportunity to show that in this case the types of unfairness concerns are not really implicated, and that this rule is for that reason not arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.508" offset="4712642">Respondents notably do not rely heavily on the Court of Appeals' construction of the Administrative Procedure Act, but instead rely principally on the argument that the Medicare Act, wholly apart from the Administrative Procedure Act, bars retroactive cost limit rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.046" offset="4786829">The problem with their analysis is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.904" offset="4798219">First, we don't believe that anything in the language of the statute states that cost limit rules must be prospective, and second, the legislative history upon which they rely does not speak to the type of retroactive rule at issue in this case, which is merely curative in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.320" offset="4863943">The statutory language, which is in Section 1395x(v)(1)(A), reproduced on pages 2 and 3 of our brief, does not have any kind of a hint of a prospectivity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.454" offset="4916397">It states broadly that the Secretary may promulgate cost limit rules based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of health services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.170" offset="4951296">The language is straightforward, it's unambiguous, and there's no prospectivity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.465" offset="4972508">Respondents' only meaningful answer to the statutory language are statements in the legislative history that say that cost limit rules would operate prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.101" offset="5015035">In our view, those statements reflect Congress' understanding that cost limit rules generally in practice would operate prospectively, which is in fact what they do in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.878" offset="5058085">But we think those statements fall far short of suggesting that Congress decided and considered the possibility of retroactive rules being appropriate in certain confined circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.436" offset="5104374">Indeed, the very reasons that Congress gives for generally favoring prospective rules we believe are the reasons it is most unlikely that Congress intended to bar all retroactive rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.587" offset="5145020">Congress was concerned about providers incurring costs before they knew the substance of the cost limit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.929" offset="5170307">In this case respondents incurred all of their costs before the 1981 rule was invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.536" offset="5192772">In fact, as I mentioned earlier, for this reason if the Secretary had not promulgated a retroactive rule, the very concerns expressed by Congress would have been realized, because other providers relied to their advantage on the substance of the 1981 rule in incurring their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.295" offset="5259855">This is not a rule that the Secretary promulgated to, despite its unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.917" offset="5282320">The retroactive rule was promulgated in order to avoid unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.213" offset="5299456">More hospitals benefit from the retroactive rule than are burdened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.820" offset="5317951">In over 234 areas the wage indices went up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.365" offset="5332057">In 67 areas the wage indices went down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.552" offset="5344805">The Federal government may end up paying more money out under the retroactive rule than they would have under a prospective rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.298" offset="5379809">The government is not... in other words, this is not a case where we're just trying to promulgate a retroactive rule to save the Federal face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.341" offset="5411992">It's a case where the retroactive rule is justified for two other compelling reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.121" offset="5431114">One, to ensure adequate reimbursement for other providers who were receiving too little reimbursement under the Medicare Act, and second, to prevent a windfall by a few providers who were seeking to recover reimbursement for inefficient costs at the expense of other providers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.068" offset="7062931">We contend that the Secretary's rule is invalid on 4 discreet grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.584" offset="8144923">It involved only a limited number of hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.536" offset="8156730">It did not require any action, either favorable or unfavorable against hospitals that were not participating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.641" offset="8185151">And indeed the Secretary published his 1984 rule after settling virtually all cost reports in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.403" offset="8220260">He did not pay those other hospitals under the wage index which included Federal government hospital data.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.869" offset="8246069">He continued to use the 1981 wage index rule for those other hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.493" offset="8272609">And in other circumstances he has clearly taken the position that he's not required to recoup in circumstances similar to these, we have cited that in the last paragraph of our footnote 36, which contains those references.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.001" offset="8326630">And Judge Oberdorfer in his decision in this case, at pages 38 and 39 of the petition appendix, explains, provides further reasons why there, why recoupment would not be required from other hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.950" offset="8386398">So I think there's simply no merit at all to that, to the suggestion from the Secretary on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.276" offset="8719721">When Congress enacted Section 223(b) of the 1972 amendments, it made as clear as it possibly could that cost limits are to apply only on a prospective basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.986" offset="9566611">Third, I think the Secretary's interpretation, his post hoc construction, is not a possible reading of that language anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.999" offset="9610601">The language refers to a process of retroactive adjustments where a provider's aggregate reimbursement for a period proves to be excessive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.072" offset="12266940">I would like to briefly discuss 5 USC Section 553(d), that establishes a 30-day delayed effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.832" offset="12321902">This rule here applies back to July 1, 1981, thus despite what the Secretary may say it has an effective date of July 1, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.468" offset="12368505">And yet 553(d) precludes a retroactive effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.716" offset="12393478">Section 553(d) is very similar to a statute which this Court addressed in the case of United States v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, which we've cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.164" offset="12443319">That case involved a statute that precluded certain orders... let me rephrase that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.036" offset="12470800">It established a 30-day delayed effective date for certain orders of the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.909" offset="12494310">And all members of this Court, including the dissent in that case, agreed on one thing, that is that the statute precluded the &lt;ICC&gt; [= ICC] from applying these rules retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.124" offset="12539136">The language of that statute in 553(d) are very close, and I think merit very close review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.354" offset="12572051">I would like to briefly address the Secretary's curative rulemaking argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.646" offset="12613220">We believe that the, the Secretary's attempted curing is something that cannot be done because of the very nature of the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.282" offset="12659718">The Secretary has missed a very important deadline established by Congress, one that reflects important values.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.764" offset="12693677">From a procedural point of view he was certainly entitled to repeal his, or his 1979 rule and put in effect a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.337" offset="12731920">But to do that validly he had to publish a final rule by June 1, 1981 under Section 553(d), and he had to have completed the procedures mandated by the APA by that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.254" offset="12783643">He had to publish a proposed notice, solicit comments, respond to the comments and publish a basis and purpose statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.783" offset="12805794">He didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.127" offset="12811123">In fact he didn't even start those procedures by June 1, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.812" offset="12829827">And there's nothing that the Secretary can do in 1984 to complete those procedures by June 1, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.340" offset="12863995">That's simply axiomatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.838" offset="12874026">Also, the Secretary at bottom is asking this Court to reward him for his illegal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.490" offset="12908612">If the Secretary had acted legally on June 30, 1981, when he published the 1981 rule, he could not have given his new rule an effective date of July 1, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.486" offset="12956573">There's no reason why the Secretary should be in a better position today because he acted illegally rather than legally on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.592" offset="13000981">To allow that would truly be to trivialize and make a mockery of the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.417" offset="13020312">As far as our third and fourth contentions go, we believe that we would be entitled to a judgment, to favorable judgment under any balancing test, as Judge Oberdorfer expressly found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.442" offset="13076423">Judge Oberdorfer applied the balancing test, and the ill effects of the Secretary's rule have been very substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.659" offset="13105262">He has applied this rule to reverse a final court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.391" offset="13124175">He has in effect substituted retroactive rulemaking for the normal appeals process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.092" offset="13146954">He has applied this rule to recoup from already settled cost reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.449" offset="13168374">In this case he applied it to recoup Medicare reimbursement for a, a, for costs incurred four years previously, but presumably under the Secretary's view it could have been six, seven, eight years previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.663" offset="13225321">It would be very hard to draw the limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.849" offset="13233994">And as for the merits, well we have made our case in our brief at some length, and I think we have demonstrated that in issuing this rule the Secretary failed to consider relevant factors and drew conclusions contrary to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.889" offset="13302225">And in his brief, the Secretary loosely throws around the windfalls, the word "windfalls", but you will note that he has made no response to our showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.401" offset="13344230">He says, that should be remanded to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.727" offset="13357500">But you might want to look at his last briefs before the Court of Appeals because he essentially made no showing on the merits there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.803" offset="13381847">If the Secretary had a case to make on the merits, he would make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.223" offset="13403476">He has not made it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.112" offset="13411104">I can tell you as someone who has read every page of the record at least four or five times, the Secretary cannot make a case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.859" offset="13450078">The rulemaking in this case was truly pro forma, as Judge Oberdorfer found in his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.732" offset="13473589">We respectfully submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals was correct and should be affirmed for any or all of the four reasons that we have discussed today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.425" offset="13572332">The court found only one error in the 1981 rule, the lack of notice and comment, and specifically declined to order the Secretary to reimburse him pursuant to the 1979 rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.352" offset="13675985">But it was not one, which Judge Oberdorfer correctly recognized, which mandated that he order reimbursement pursuant to the 1979 rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.583" offset="13704929">And in his opinion he explained why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.785" offset="13717781">He said, it is clear that to invalidate the 1981 wage index rule and enjoin defendants, the Secretary, from retroactively applying any new schedule that excludes Federal wage data might well permit claims to recover a larger amount of Medicare reimbursement than they would under the present 1981 schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.982" offset="13782565">He recognized that for that reason it would be appropriate, and he didn't do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.308" offset="13799806">Second, the respondents concede, I believe, that the APA does not bar retroactive rules in all circumstances, that in narrow circumstances it is appropriate.</text>
