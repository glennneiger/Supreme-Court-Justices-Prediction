            <text syncTime="69.494" offset="423343">Since I am the Petitioner herein, for ease of communication, I will hereafter use the first person in my presentation of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.750" offset="456362">I was admitted to the California Bar in 1981 and the Iowa Bar in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.487" offset="479245">Since June of 1984 I have been employed by the law firm of Marcus &amp; Mallard in Fairfield, Iowa where I have practiced primarily in the area of corporate and securities law.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.878" offset="524907">In the fall of 1986 our firm, which consisted of three lawyers at the time, decided to take on a fourth lawyer who had substantial experience in litigation and could develop a litigation practice within the firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.721" offset="584257">Because this lawyer was not yet in a position to seek admission to the Southern District, I obtained admission so that our firm could appear as counsel in two cases in the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.362" offset="630755">I had no intention to undertake the responsibility of litigating those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.683" offset="656042">Because I appeared before the Southern District, my name was added to a list of attorneys available for pro bono service.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.770" offset="684463">In June 1987 I was informed by the Volunteer Lawyer's Project that I had been appointed to represent the plaintiffs in the case of Traman v. Parkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.227" offset="726259">This case involved complaints by three prison inmates against eight prison guards and administrators alleging physical mistreatment, that the role of the inmates as informants had been exposed to other inmates and that the plaintiffs in that case, their lives had been endangered.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.689" offset="796058">The plaintiffs in that case were seeking both damages and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.808" offset="816538">In June 1987, several weeks after I had reviewed that file, I filed a motion to withdraw on the grounds that adequate representation of the plaintiffs in that case would require substantial discovery and extensive examination and cross examination of multiple parties and other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.256" offset="902324">In my estimation, I was not competent to provide the services that would be required for effective representation of those parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.635" offset="1083927">I think that, you know, I had been applying perhaps a different standard, a higher standard based on the services that I would like to see provided and that I believe that I commonly provide to my other clients in a business setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.228" offset="1146308">I offered, in my motion, to provide alternative pro bono service, but that offer was not considered by the District Court as being sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.805" offset="1196567">In connection with my appeal of the ruling on competence, I also brought a motion to the District Court on the ground that 1915(d) did not empower the District Court to require an unwilling attorney to undertake a representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.843" offset="1436685">I think the Respondent bears a heavy burden to show that it could not obtain counsel by making a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.097" offset="1465733">Just because the first lawyer who is requested to undertake a representation declines, I do not believe that that is evidence that other lawyers who felt more comfortable with the task would not step forward upon request.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.024" offset="1521426">I believe that attorneys have been very giving of their time and that as a practical matter when a litigator has developed a relationship with a certain judge and receives a call from that judge and a request, that it would be very unlikely that that person would decline the judge's request.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.267" offset="1686416">I think... as an example in this case, the Respondent's counsel, the Attorney General for the State of Iowa, is appearing on behalf of the Southern District based upon a request made by that court.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.521" offset="3571411">Because I believe that if this Court believes the words "may request" are ambiguous on their face, that the intent can be inferred for four reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.119" offset="3661795">The difference in the treatment of these two objectives by Congress is apparent from the distinction in the language which is employed in Sections 1915(c) and 1915(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="890.927" offset="3709024">Subsection (c) deals with officers of the court such as persons serving process, which was distinguished from attorneys, and provides that these persons shall issue and serve process.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.336" offset="3762732">While subsection (d) provides only that the court may request an attorney to represent a person unable to employ counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.042" offset="3797527">Congress knew how to use language which suggests an element of compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.160" offset="3814037">It chose to do it in subsection (c) and it chose not to do it in subsection (d) relating to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.333" offset="3842667">As a second point on Congressional intent, it is instructive to consider the manner in which the language was most likely chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.855" offset="3876731">Legislative history shows that 1915(d) was inspired by certain state statutes in existence at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.692" offset="3908078">In fact, there were 11 such state statutes and all of them describe the power of the court to obtain counsel by using the words "appoint" or "assign".</text>

            <text syncTime="973.614" offset="4039839">I believe it is in the Joint Appendix and... it's in a committee report by the Committee of the Judiciary, and it's near the end of the Joint Appendix where the Committee states or the member of the Committee who was filing the report, that the statute is inspired by the humane, enlightened laws of several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.064" offset="4145583">An historical study shows that there were 11 statutes, in effect and, again, as I mentioned, they all used the word "appoint" or "assign".</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.837" offset="4180691">The charge in that language in 1915(d) was presumably made with the intent to change the meaning of the federal provision and the degree of power conferred upon the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.663" offset="4231996">The third argument supporting the proposition that Congress intended 1915(d) to give the courts authority to request rather than require an attorney to take a case is that Congress did not provide for any compensation under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.173" offset="4294063">In contrast to this, federal statutes that expressly empower a court to appoint or assign an attorney typically provide for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.612" offset="4331784">The fact that Congress did not do so under 1915(d) is further evidence that Congress expected attorneys to appear as volunteers only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.900" offset="4368982">As a fourth and final point on Congressional intent, I would refer to the response made to Justice O'Connor earlier with respect to the different types of legal interests involved which the Constitution or Congress would have a desire to protect, and the other end of the spectrum where it's not possible to know of the importance of those rights in leaving it to the discretion of the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.752" offset="4784329">In short, an analysis of legislative history and intent supports my reading of 1915(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.808" offset="4816616">The final consideration for this Court to hold in my favor involves the fundamental principle that a statute should be construed narrowly so as to avoid serious constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.865" offset="4860816">The Respondent argues that the word "request" should be read broadly to mean "require".</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.019" offset="4881400">But such a broad reading could render 1915(d) unconstitutional under the First and Fifth Amendments in accordance with the arguments set forth in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.375" offset="4918807">Consequently, this Court should resolve any doubts it has regarding the meaning of 1915(d) by construing the statue narrowly in accordance with its commonly-understood meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.551" offset="4975545">In connection with the argument that's made by the Respondent that the statute would be rendered null or that the District Court's power would be helplessly ineffective if this Court were to rule in my favor, again, I submit that the system of making requests does work and, secondly, that, as discussed earlier, the legislative history suggests that Congress was not ultimately concerned with providing counsel in these cases, but had as its main purpose the opening of the courts to the poor by waiving certain court fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.141" offset="5121936">Last, even if Congress intended to provide an assurance of representation under 1915(d) and found that the statute when construed in the manner I advocate was ineffective in doing so, Congress might correct this problem by enacting a new statute which either clearly used language of compulsion or, more likely, provided for compensation so that the availability of counsel was not entirely dependent upon volunteerism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.910" offset="5236979">In conclusion, this Court should rule in my favor because the word 1915(d) is plain and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.497" offset="5267385">Even if this Court were to find some ambiguity, the legislative history and intent of Congress supports a ruling in my favor also.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.920" offset="5709064">Well, I think in discussing the word "request"... and it's dealt with extensively in the briefs... I think you have to look at it contextually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.093" offset="5745740">One can get a request from a stranger on the street which, as an Iowan, I come to Washington, D.C. and I see a lot of those.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.446" offset="8319114">That causes a broad pattern of difficulty because I would suggest that there is very little difference between the appointment... albeit, the statute says appoint... of an individual attorney to represent a criminal defendant on an unwilling basis than there is representing a civil case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.842" offset="11660698">The plan originated on a voluntary basis through the Volunteer Lawyer's Project whereby attorneys signed up to augment the services of Legal Services Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.531" offset="11699464">Eight hundred lawyers volunteered in the Southern District, and in 1988 they closed 1,432 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.351" offset="11726736">There was an absolute certainty that you would get a case on referral from legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.089" offset="11745753">Those 800 hundred cases, the District Court felt, were... those 800 attorneys... it was unfair to require them or to request them to service also the many, many, many federal cases that we had in the civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.163" offset="11797998">So, they augmented the plan by saying we're going to have 3,500 attorneys who have participated in federal court and are members of that bar and have consented, through their oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.455" offset="11839167">That way, based upon the appointment process, you will only get a case once every seven or eight or nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.191" offset="11870096">Mr. Mallard opted not to sign up for the Volunteer Lawyer's Project whereby appointment would be almost a certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.380" offset="11898830">He then put his name in the barrel because he got into the federal bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.294" offset="11986497">And, as he suggested here, he would have been allowed to do bankruptcy and creditor's rights because the checksheet says... when you fill out for Volunteer Lawyer's Project what kind of cases would you like.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.490" offset="12155353">And then I'm allowed to sit in front of the bar.</text>
