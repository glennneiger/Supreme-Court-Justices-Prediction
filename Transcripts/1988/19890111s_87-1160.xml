            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86554">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in number 87-1160, Duquesne Light Company against Barasch.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.488" offset="116438">Duquesne Light Company and its co-petitioner, Pennsylvania Power Company, are two utilities that provide electrical service in Western Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.194" offset="155308">In 1967, they joined a venture to construct seven nuclear-generating units.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.280" offset="179654">Intervening events such as the Arab oil embargo and the accident at Three Mile Island, however, forced them to cancel plans for construction of four of these plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.235" offset="219465">The utilities attempted to cover their expenditures for the preliminary work looking to build the plants through an increase in electrical rates to customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.349" offset="255932">The Pennsylvania Utilities Commission allowed the increase, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.330" offset="283831">It read a recently enacted Pennsylvania statute as disallowing any charge in the rates for construction of generating facilities which were not used and useful in service to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.371" offset="332001">We hold that nothing in the United States constitution requires that a utility necessarily be allowed to recover this sort of expenditures which Duquesne sought to recover here.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.986" offset="370453">The utilities have not suggested that the rates they will be allowed are insufficient to compensate them for the cost of their capital on the risk on their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.999" offset="402531">That the Act may be theoretically inconsistent with the balance of Pennsylvania's rate making approaches of no importance so long as the overall rate is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.667" offset="437222">We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.238" offset="451432">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice White and Justice O'Connor have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.723" offset="473375">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissent.</text>
