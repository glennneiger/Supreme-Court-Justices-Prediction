            <text syncTime="9.794" offset="191578">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.838" offset="215820">This summons enforcement case presents two distinct issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.853" offset="231911">First, the authority of the district court to place a condition on its enforcement order requiring the IRS to return to the court for prior approval of certain uses of a summon material.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.066" offset="272662">And, second, the correctness of the standard applied by the court of appeals in ruling upon Respondents' claim of attorney/client privilege for one of the summoned documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.172" offset="309129">I will turn my attention initially and primarily to the first question, which has major implications for the effective conduct of IRS investigations generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.622" offset="346955">Respondents here oppose the enforcement of the IRS' summons on the ground that it was not issued in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.307" offset="373704">Specifically, they alleged that the IRS was seeking the summoned documents not for use in its own tax investigation of Ron Hubbard but for the purpose of furnishing the documents to the Department of Justice for use in the defense of a civil damage suit that had been brought against federal officials by the Church of Scientology.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.502" offset="442458">After a hearing, the district court emphatically rejected these allegations and ordered the summons enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.797" offset="467640">In its order, the court stated, and I quote from page 27(a) at the Appendix to the Petition,</text>
            <text syncTime="86.059" offset="496688">"The Church has failed to raise any doubt of the good faith of the IRS in pursuing this summons enforcement proceeding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="91.854" offset="519885">And the court went on to state that the agent did not issue the summons for an improper or collateral purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.679" offset="543186">At the hearing, the court was even more explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.850" offset="555830">And, again, I quote from page 45 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.317" offset="569727">"There is not an iota of evidence that this summons is being prosecuted for any reason other than to gather information for the ongoing investigation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="112.298" offset="601596">Nevertheless, faced with continued entreaties by Respondents' counsel that the IRS' aim in fact was to turn over the summon material to the Justice Department, and also with the government's statement that it had no such intention, the court sua sponte placed a condition on its enforcement order.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.121" offset="664917">Namely, the court held that the summoned material could not be disclosed to any other government agency without a prior order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.008" offset="696473">And the court went on to suggest at the hearing that it would issue such an order if the government could demonstrate that the proposed disclosure complied with the confidentiality rules of Section 6103.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.418" offset="1754119">As we pointed out in our reply brief, there is a presumption that the government intends to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.291" offset="1777629">And courts cannot go out issuing orders just telling parties that they have to comply with the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.378" offset="1833949">But the problem is procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.769" offset="1839487">And this Court has grappled in many different contexts with the various procedures applicable to summons enforcement proceedings and has constantly reiterated the importance of having summary enforcement proceedings once it will not interfere with the IRS' investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.279" offset="1901554">And it is our view that this kind of regime under which the courts will... well, maybe issue the summons for now but keep looking to see what the IRS is doing with the information, have the IRS come back if they're going to do something that's a little questionable, overall poses a great threat to effective investigations and one that outweighs the fact that it may be in some case, as Justice Stevens posits, the court may in fact be impelled to deny enforcement for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.190" offset="2009178">I think these courts' decisions, in addition to continually emphasizing, as recently as last month's decision in Stuart, the summary nature of IRS investigations also reflect the fact that the summons enforcement scheme has always been understood as one where the district court's role is limited and one that takes place in one slice of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.495" offset="2098412">The district court looks at the IRS' summons when it's issue at the time of the enforcement proceeding and decides at that time whether the summons has been issued in good faith for a legitimate purpose under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.380" offset="2145955">And at that point, it decides either to deny or to compel enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.408" offset="2162047">The statute that gives the court jurisdiction, gives it authority only to compel enforcement and, of course, to decline to compel enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.578" offset="3910788">--I think I'd like to mention one other policy point that's involved here in addition to the delay that can occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.823" offset="3959689">Actually, the delay can occur at two stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.526" offset="3966586">If these kinds of restrictive orders are permitted, we think (a) that it will cause additional delay at the initial summons enforcement stage where, as opposed to the normal fairly summary proceeding where litigants occasionally are challenging whether there's bad faith or good faith and whether the summons should be enforced, there will be a whole additional set of litigation over what sort of restrictions are appropriate for which documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.266" offset="4061462">They are appropriate and possible appeals from that kind of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.139" offset="4081002">And also, of course, down the road you have the problem of where the IRS is required to come back to the court for permission to make the particular use that's been restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.964" offset="4116319">Even if the Court agrees with the IRS that the disclosure, or whatever it is, is permissible, it's still a serious problem because the investigation is halted in the middle, the IRS has to run back to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.694" offset="4159265">As you know, they have to get a court date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.084" offset="4168773">They can't just walk in that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.380" offset="4173998">And the whole thing is halted for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.957" offset="4184238">Second, at least in the 6103 context, most of the disclosures that are going to be sought by the IRS in this connection... or, many of them anyway... are going to come under Section 6103(k)(6) which is disclosures that are necessary for law enforcement purposes for the IRS investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.403" offset="4258008">I think in order for the IRS to persuade the court that the disclosure is necessary for that purpose, it's going to have to give a little bit of a roadmap of its investigation to the court to explain why the disclosure is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.508" offset="4306491">And that obviously can inhibit the success of the investigation if that kind of information is provided to the target, a problem that this Court alluded to in the O'Brien case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.925" offset="4344107">I think I should turn briefly now to the attorney/client question, if there are no further questions on the summons issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.249" offset="4381410">The question here is whether the tape recording of a meeting between certain church officials and their counsel is protected by the attorney/client privilege because the government did not prove by evidence independent of the communications themselves that the meeting was in furtherance of a crime or fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.883" offset="4451941">The IRS here produced as evidence that the crime-fraud exception applied a partial transcript of the tape that had been furnished by an informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.193" offset="4485168">And, in addition, because this tape had actually been in the possession of the IRS for a short time, and an IRS official had listened to the tape, the IRS also proffered the affidavit of an IRS agent describing the contents of the tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.873" offset="4535950">The court of appeals held that this highly-probative evidence cannot be considered in determining the applicability of the crime-fraud exception because it is not independent of the communications itself... themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.682" offset="4587150">The result of the court of appeals rule is that there are going to be cases where the court knows to an absolute certainty that the communications are not privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.131" offset="4621005">Nevertheless, it will be bound to deny probative evidence to the factfinder on grounds of attorney/client privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.630" offset="11950964">And the government must go to the district court and it must say we want enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.854" offset="12055872">But we think the kind of order that was well-reasoned and entered into this case strikes a perfect balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.360" offset="12925854">Okay.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="3193.875" offset="12927944">Getting back to what I said before, there's a summons there and if the IRS is entitled to enforcement, the court is supposed to compel enforcement of the summons, not change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.200" offset="12957201">And there has been litigation on that kind of subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.699" offset="12971203">I'd like to talk briefly about this idea of abuse of process because it seems to me this is just the core of Respondents' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.430" offset="12998161">Is that the notion the courts have an inherent authority to prevent abuse of their process basically gives them carte blanche in whatever sort of order they want in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.801" offset="13039643">We don't deny there's inherent authority to control abuse of process, but there's nothing like that going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.988" offset="13060437">This is discussed at great length by this Court in Powell case and follows through in subsequent summons enforcement cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.624" offset="13086977">We know what abuse of process is in this context and it is the issuance of a summons in bad faith for an illegitimate purpose that is not encompassed by the congressional grant of authority and the other is sort of power criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.572" offset="13138700">If the court were... if the IRS were to get a summons under the circumstances where it did not satisfy those criteria, that would be an abuse of the court's process, and the court is entitled to protect itself against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.099" offset="13184884">And that's why there is a summons enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.426" offset="13194184">In this case, and in most cases, the court looked at those criteria and it found... and it found quite unequivocally that there was no bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.453" offset="13230233">That the IRS was entitled to enforcement of its summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.609" offset="13238906">That ends the abuse of process inquiry, and it does not give this kind of carte blanche for the court to go out there to see what the IRS is going to do with the documents down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.246" offset="13277462">And I should mention, I guess, that all through summons enforcement law you see that the court does not really take it upon itself to worry about what the IRS does with documents down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.100" offset="13324796">In the LaSalle case, of course, there was a great controversy over whether the summons should be enforced there because of the danger at that time information would immediately infringe on criminal discovery and the role of the grand jury because there had already been a criminal referral in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.438" offset="13390207">But, of course, in the typical IRS investigation where there is no criminal referral in effect, documents are furnished to the IRS pursuant to a summons and then later on down the road, a year later, a year and a half later, the case may be referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.213" offset="13445273">And that information that came through the summons goes to the Justice Department at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.851" offset="13463872">And there's nothing wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.835" offset="13467738">That doesn't show abuse of the court's process or bad faith, or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.865" offset="13483934">The idea of the summons enforcement proceeding is to decide at that time whether the summons should be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.097" offset="13500861">As far as the benignness of this particular restriction, we think the real problem here is that there is no way to draw a line between the kind of restriction that the court imposed here and much broader and more intrusive restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.531" offset="13554569">If the court has the authority to monitor the IRS' investigation, as the Ninth Circuit says, then there will be other... a lot of litigation and a lot of other restrictions that are very damaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.215" offset="13589260">Just to quickly summarize the attorney/client issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.307" offset="13605665">Of course, we don't concede that there is any independent evidence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.663" offset="13619144">When I was induced to concede that the district court would have to at least have some evidence before it made an in camera inspection, there's certainly no reason why that evidence has to be independent in the sense that Respondent was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.330" offset="13681733">Neither the court of appeals nor Respondents have given any reason why there should be such a rule, and we suggest that there shouldn't be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.125" offset="13704930">But, again, the issue in this case is whether the court is precluded from ever looking at so-called nonindependent evidence before it decides whether the attorney/client privilege should be taken away because of crime-fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.323" offset="13753727">Thank you.</text>
