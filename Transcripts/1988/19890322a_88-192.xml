            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="38.958" offset="304343">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1983, the Arkansas Legislature enacted the Highway Use Equalization tax, imposed for the right to operate certain heavy trucks on the State's highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.849" offset="355857">This tax was assessed at a rate of five cents a mile, up to a ceiling of $175 or 3,500 miles of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.172" offset="389189">All operations each year in excess of 3,500 miles were untaxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.740" offset="407475">Now, because vehicles base registered in Arkansas tend to make much more extensive use of the State's highways than non-Arkansas vehicles, the free ride given by Arkansas for operations in excess of 3,500 miles resulted, as both courts below found, in a substantially lower tax cost per mile for Arkansas than for non-Arkansas truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.622" offset="495037">In fact, most members of the petitioner class paid the five cent a mile option, and the average cost for the in-state vehicle was one cent per mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.462" offset="530355">Now, before this HUE tax even went into effect, this suit was filed challenging the validity of the tax on various grounds, and on behalf of a subclass consisting of non-Arkansas base registered truckers, a challenge was made under the commerce clause to the HUE flat tax on precisely the grounds ultimately upheld by this Court in the Scheiner case some four and a half years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.712" offset="639338">Now, this extended effort by interstate truckers to rid themselves of the discriminatory HUE tax... I think it is important to appreciate what we went through during this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.103" offset="688866">We began with an effort to have the tax proceeds placed in escrow rather than deposited in the State treasury, to facilitate refunds in the event that the tax was struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.542" offset="726691">That was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.044" offset="736722">We went through the lower Arkansas courts and the Arkansas Supreme Court, and they upheld the validity of the tax under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.100" offset="768905">The case came up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.368" offset="777996">Eventually, after the Scheiner decision, it was remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.754" offset="791475">After it was remanded, the State continued to collect the tax, doing everything in its power to delay the inevitable decision holding it un-Constitutional under the principles of Scheiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.995" offset="836510">As a result of these efforts, we came back to Justice Blackmon, a circuit justice, seeking the imposition of an escrow to stop the bleeding, basically, and it was granted, and the funds from August 14, 1987 on were placed in escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.404" offset="902129">This, I think, is what produced legislation in Arkansas in October of 1987 repealing the HUE tax and replacing it with a tax of 2.5 cents per mile, but not flat... it would be paid by everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.933" offset="964196">The Arkansas Supreme Court actually did not get around to invalidating the HUE tax in this case until March of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.187" offset="993245">Now, in what some might consider a tacit admission of weakness on the merits of the retroactivity issues brought before this court for review, Arkansas devotes nearly half of its brief to strikingly novel and, we think, quite farfetched arguments designed to avoid the merits, such is the contention that the 11th Amendment bars the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over a Federal question decided by a State court in any case that could not have been brought within the original jurisdiction of the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.956" offset="1116333">Now, unless there are questions on issues of this sort, I would like to devote my limited time to the merits of the retroactivity issue.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="250.728" offset="1151442">Well, it seems to me that the question is not only retroactivity, but assuming that the tax is retroactively stricken, what the remedy is.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.189" offset="1221241">That is, this is a suit that was brought under the illegal exactions provision of the Arkansas Constitution, and I think that it has to be taken as matters stand in this Court, although there is an unresolved claim of sovereign immunity in the case, as matters stand in this Court, in light of the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court, Arkansas will give refunds if these taxes were exacted in violation of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.324" offset="1321760">Whether they were exacted in violation of Federal law depends, in Arkansas' view, on the application of the Chevron test.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.882" offset="1480062">First of all, it is not our bottom line, because the question here is whether... the question of whether Scheiner is retroactive is a question of what, substantive rule of law governs our claim for refund of taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.122" offset="1612973">Now, if the Arkansas courts were to say, we are sorry, you are not entitled to any remedy, than they would have to overcome an argument that we have made and would make again that Federal law requires a refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.092" offset="2244823">Well, I would say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.693" offset="2255272">First of all, the question of whether taxes were passed on, which no claim of pass-on has made in our case, would figure in for the Federal Chevron test.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.417" offset="2302188">That is, it would relate to the equities of making a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.619" offset="2314936">Now, it might also relate to a separate, that is, the State may have a separate rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.588" offset="2330818">For example, States sometimes have rules that if you did not bear the legal incidence of the tax, say, in the case of a sales tax, the person that remits the tax, the store, is just a collector of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.896" offset="2380033">Some States have rules that say you cannot get a refund if the tax is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.533" offset="2398632">The question for this Court would be whether that would be, I think, an adequate State ground for denying a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.536" offset="2426636">But I think it is clear from this Court's decisions that where the State court decides a question of Federal law is the basis for its decision, this court clearly has jurisdiction to review it.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.306" offset="2537708">Most of the State amicus briefs in this case suggest the Chevron test.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.242" offset="2557457">The court has generally dealt with questions of retroactivity under the Chevron test in the civil area.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.811" offset="2579713">We think the Chevron test should be modified in the case of Constitutional violations by the Government in light of the principles that were set forth in the Owen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.969" offset="2624330">We think that there is a different problem presented when the Government violates Constitutional rights and then seeks to avoid retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.977" offset="2672396">On the other hand, we think the Chevron best does state, in a general sense, the framework that you would look at.</text>

            <text syncTime="658.780" offset="2783573">Now, they have argued that the commerce clause does not of its own force provide a cause of action or provide a right to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.284" offset="2817636">We do not agree with that, but my point again is that Arkansas law, as Justice White pointed out, clearly provides a right to relief, because we got it on the escrow monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.992" offset="2856507">So I do not... I think this is all a distraction, and not a problem, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.662" offset="2883151">Now, I think, given the limitations of time... I have said a little bit about the first prong of the Chevron test, which goes to the question of the extent of justifiable reliance by the party seeking non-retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.238" offset="2945427">Now, you have to look at this case with the understanding that it is now... we now know, in light of the Scheiner decision, that the State exacted from non-Arkansas truckers millions of dollars of taxes, un-Constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.431" offset="3002270">That is a fact that we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.800" offset="3011674">The question we are addressing in the retroactivity inquiry is whether the rules under which this action was un-Constitutional should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.639" offset="3051067">The first prong of this retroactivity inquiry asked how strong is the reliance interest of the people who say do not apply the correct rule of law to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.530" offset="3090668">Now, I am willing to concede that before Scheiner was decided, the outcome was not a sure thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.600" offset="3122851">I think Scheiner was a close case.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.569" offset="3130792">It could have gone either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.588" offset="3138838">The thing that made it a close case was the old Aero Mayflower precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.556" offset="3154720">I think that even Justice O'Connor, in your dissent, that was the factor that was critical in your concerns in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.746" offset="3187530">I think that but for Aero Mayflower, there would not have been any serious dispute under Complete Auto and Commonwealth Edison about the un-Constitutionality of the HUE tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.118" offset="3224938">Now, all I want to say about this kind of a close case is that if you satisfy the first prong... the first prong of Chevron is designed to establish the general rule that most decisions are retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.807" offset="3263703">Non-retroactivity is the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.159" offset="3277182">Now, if you say every case that is close qualifies for treatment as a non-retroactive case, you are basically saying that virtually every case the Supreme Court of the United States decides is presumptively or likely to be non-retroactive, where you have to go through a Chevron analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.252" offset="3333502">I wonder whether you want to walk down that road.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.621" offset="3346982">Now, let me turn to the second prong very briefly, and there is wealth of things to cover here.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.775" offset="3367566">But it is a very important point that the State court missed, and that the State misses in its brief, in talking about the importance of the policies that underlay the Scheiner rule, and whether, in deciding the retroactivity of Scheiner, you would be furthering or impeding those policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.736" offset="3439455">They say, well, there are no individual rights under the commerce clause, they say, well, the problem has been cured for the future, so what is the problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="830.842" offset="3471847">Now, what they are turning a blind eye to is the institutional concerns that underlie the commerce clause itself, which is the tremendous hydraulic pressures on State legislators to enact parochial, discriminatory legislation that favors local interests at the expenses of out-of-State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.821" offset="3551782">We would say that the commerce clause cases are almost a paradigm of the case in which the second prong of the Chevron test calls for full retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.629" offset="3602982">Let me just say, I will not talk about the equities, because my time is running out.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.181" offset="3621267">I would just like to say one word about the post-Scheiner taxes, and reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.685" offset="3643210">I do not understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.271" offset="3649584">The State collected substantial sums of money after Scheiner was decided under a tax that was plainly un-Constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.396" offset="3910077">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in June, 1986, Petitioner McKesson decided to challenge Florida's successive enactments of the Alcoholic Beverage tax schemes that discriminated against interstate commerce in favor of local interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.108" offset="3984892">McKesson's Constitutional claims in State court requested relief both prospectively and retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.530" offset="4018642">For prospective relief, we asked the State court to enjoin the Starers continuing enforcement of a discriminatory tax, and for retroactive relief, we asked the State court to grant Florida's historic remedy for a discriminatory, un-Constitutional tax, a Florida tax refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.043" offset="4108712">McKesson challenged Florida's alcoholic beverage tax scheme on commerce clause and other Constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.966" offset="4140373">Mckesson argued that the Florida tax, both in purpose and in effect, discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of local interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.941" offset="4180288">McKesson specifically invoked Florida's general tax refund scheme, specifically section 216.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.297" offset="4221666">McKesson argued that under this Court's decisions, as well as the State statute, the appropriate remedy for the extraction of un-Constitutional taxes was the return, not of the entire tax, but only of the discriminatory portion of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.841" offset="4295853">In February, 1988, a unanimous Florida Supreme Court agreed with McKesson that the Florida tax scheme discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.601" offset="4350920">The Court recognized that McKesson's disfavored products directly competed with the local producer's favored products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.724" offset="4387387">The court recognized that as a result of the tax scheme, the State in effect had to use the courts... stripped away from McKesson its natural economic advantages, and thus the court concluded that the tax scheme has disadvantaged McKesson, raising our relative cost of doing business, and had advantaged McKesson's favorite competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.989" offset="4484458">Nevertheless, despite this Court's decisions on Constitutional tax refunds, despite the Florida court's own decisions, and despite those findings of competitive injury, the State refused to refund any portion of the un-Constitutional taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.634" offset="4554988">The Florida court denied McKesson relief by constructing it's own retroactivity doctrine that totally collides with this Court's retroactivity doctrine in Chevron.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.312" offset="4733770">We brought Florida's continuing history of enacting un-Constitutional statutes to the attention of the Florida courts for two reasons, vis a vis Chevron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.287" offset="4773685">First, under our commerce clause claim, we wanted the court to see what the legislature's purpose was in enacting the particular statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.809" offset="4811720">Secondly, vis a vis Chevron, we wanted to demonstrate to the court that in applying a test for retroactivity, the court should pay close attention to whether our basic commerce clause interests in the national common market would be frustrated or advanced by a particular remedial measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.691" offset="4907223">McKesson, indeed, submits that Chevron's first prong should be a threshold test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.578" offset="4930838">Chevron's first prong, of course, requires a court to demonstrate that it has established a new rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.368" offset="4961976">And the reasoning of Chevron strongly suggests that that initial requirement should be a threshold requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.938" offset="4992278">Chevron, of course, cites to Hanover Shoe, and Hanover Shoe says that a court has absolutely no reason to consider the theory of prospectivity unless the court has overruled clearly declared judicial precedent, and therefore needs to consider whether parties who reasonably relied upon a law may be injured by retroactive application of the new law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.647" offset="7303070">As the Court is aware, the injunction effectively denied tax preferences which had been in the statute for sales of a small group of alcoholic beverages, striking the preferences from the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.253" offset="8065532">I do not think Chevron is the right analysis under any circumstances, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.322" offset="8081832">But let me speak to the particular point about the so-called rogue legislature... the legislature that there is just no control over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.625" offset="8110985">First of all, I think that it is a fair question even in that context whether the penalty of what amounts to several hundreds of millions of dollars of taxes is an appropriate penalty for a tax exemption that may confer $5 million or $10 million worth of tax benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.420" offset="8178172">But the second point that I would make is that the Florida courts have made very clear that they will use their injunctive power not just way after the fact, but in order to keep an un-Constitutional scheme from going forward very shortly after it has been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.215" offset="8249329">If you look at the history in this particular case, when McKesson filed suit, an injunction was issued that was not stayed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.137" offset="8281094">But when the 1988 statute was challenged, the court determined that that was also an un-Constitutional statute, refused to stay the injunction on appeal, and ever since the date of that injunction, that statute has been... any discrepancies in that statute have been enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.747" offset="8347445">So, the notion that it is necessary to have what is effectively a huge damages remedy in order to control the legislature simply does not fit with what the Florida courts have done in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.933" offset="8464265">Well, to begin with, let me say that the rule that McKesson is asking for is by no means limited that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.837" offset="8487880">If the exemption, for example, had been an exemption whereby the sales tax on distribution of local products was no tax at all... was a complete exemption... then they would say, under their logic, that you are entitled to all of your taxes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.365" offset="8553917">But in this particular case, their refund request was for $85 million, just to start with, and they were just one of a great number, forty or fifty, distributors of interstate products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.689" offset="8599266">Now, even if some portion of that would not be returned because it would be covered by the sliding scale taxes, that still would be an enormous amount of money, particularly if spread to all distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.647" offset="8647122">Again, you are looking at the particular nature of the violation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.366" offset="8661960">This is a very small exemption in a broad, general tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.836" offset="8683798">And if I could return to Texas Monthly for a second, in the dissent in Texas Monthly, Justice Scalia points out that there are numerous State taxes which provide an exemption from ad valorum property taxes for the homes of clergymen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.631" offset="8750985">Now, as I understand McKesson's rule, if those exemptions are now un-Constitutional, at least as of February 22, 1989, the entire ad valorem taxes in all of those taxes are a nullity, and that everyone who is not a clergyman and pays a residential property tax could come into court and say I want all of my tax back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.663" offset="8851191">What effectively you are doing here is not creating a remedy that is tailored to the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.667" offset="8879194">It is really creating an incentive for lawyers just to work through the tax books to try and fine an exemption, no matter how minor, and then use that exemption, if it is improper, to create a tax shelter for years of back taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2587.830" offset="10499831">I mean, if McKesson is going to say that it is possible that the State courts could not have issued an injunction dealing with a State law, passed by the State legislature, conforming that to the Constitution, which would have raised somebody else's taxes, and because they might not have been able to do that, we would like to walk away with $85 million or $60 million in tax refunds seems to me a burden that they are not able to carry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.496" offset="10694495">May it please the Court, I think that no matter how one cuts it or views it, the question here today in both cases is whether there is a Federal right to e particular remedy, the remedy being tax refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.052" offset="10740680">And I notice that my friend Mr. Frey could not avoid saying that right before he sat down in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.938" offset="10764294">He has told, I think, only half the story with respect to what happened in Arkansas here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.092" offset="10784879">Two grounds were raised by the trucking association and the other petitioners when this case went back to the Arkansas Supreme Court on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.682" offset="10819256">They said first, we are entitled to refunds under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.836" offset="10835870">That is in their opening brief and in their reply brief in the Arkansas court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.388" offset="10854051">They said secondly, even if we are not entitled to refunds under State law, the Federal Constitution requires that we get refunds, They said also that the only relevance that they could see with respect to the division of refunds between before Justice Blackmon's order in August and after Justice Blackmon's order in August was State sovereign immunity, because the State sovereign immunity in Arkansas runs like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.990" offset="10976409">If the money has been deposited into the treasury of the State, the State is immune from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.161" offset="11001173">A suit cannot be brought against the State to recover money out of the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.613" offset="11018936">It is almost like Edelman v. Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.165" offset="11029176">However, if there is an escrow account set up, then the State will refund money because the sovereign immunity of the State does not attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.773" offset="11067628">That is why, when petitioners, and Mr. Frey mentioned this, went into State court for the first time on this case in 1983, they sought a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.061" offset="11112768">What kind of preliminary injunction did they seek?</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.080" offset="11120813">They sought an escrow order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.782" offset="11131576">And they said, and we quoted in their preliminary injunction brief... I think it is on paged or footnote four of our brief, but, let me read it from the record and what they told the Arkansas courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.321" offset="11169819">And this is on page 234.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.440" offset="11182253">The court well knows the rules of Arkansas, of the Arkansas Supreme Court concerning tax monies paid voluntarily and deposited in the treasury of the State cannot be recovered except under cumbersome claims commission procedures and a special appropriation by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.985" offset="11244425">Now, the point of all this is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.552" offset="11254665">In the Arkansas Supreme Court, two claims were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.371" offset="11270025">We are entitled to a refund under State law, and we are entitled to a refund under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.359" offset="11293953">The petitioners in this case did not get refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.811" offset="11307746">Therefore, it follows necessarily that the Arkansas court rejected both of those arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.917" offset="11344213">As I said, the question, no matter how one looks at it in this case, is whether there is some, to quote Mr. Frey, Federal right to a refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.245" offset="11633440">But for what it is worth, the petitioners in this case filed a petition for rehearing in the Arkansas Supreme Court, claiming that sovereign immunity had been decided, and that the court had decided sovereign immunity incorrectly and should not have prevented them from getting refunds prior to Justice Blackmon's escrow order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.757" offset="11703553">But, regardless, this Court is sitting to decide Federal questions, and the Federal question presented in our case is, do they nave a right to a refund?</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.513" offset="11738557">Now, they argue on the Chevron basis, and claim, I suppose, that that is not really a claim under Federal law for a refund, although the argument in favor of retroactivity is, we are entitled to a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.754" offset="11791533">That is why Chevron should be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.206" offset="11801356">And I think we Just keep going around in circles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.324" offset="11809819">The question here is, I think, essentially, does the Constitution, does the commerce clause, should it be enforced by the court not only by granting injunctive relief but also by giving retroactive monetary awards?</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.818" offset="11867811">That is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.384" offset="11874080">And our brief addresses that question, and points out a number of factors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.655" offset="11895083">And I would like to go into them in the context of the facts of this particular case, which I need to address because I think there has been some misunderstanding about what we have, what is involved exactly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.831" offset="11955791">The tax that is concerned in the Arkansas case applied only to the heaviest trucks in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.670" offset="11983168">Those trucks weigh more than 36 tons... up to 40 tons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.597" offset="12042936">Now, we heard about a test that said that truckers base-registered in Arkansas pay three times less than truckers based elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.154" offset="12089120">That is not a test that has anything to do with discrimination against interstate commerce, because it is a test that takes a group of interstate truckers, and compares them to another group of interstate truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.093" offset="12132902">There is, in six years of litigation here, there has never been one intra, wholly intrastate truck identified that is hauling 40 tons back and forth from Fort Smith to Little Rock, or wherever, in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.138" offset="12197058">These are the jumbos of the industry, and to ask the question how many intrastate trucks there are involved in this case is to ask why do we not use the Queen Mary as the Staten island Ferry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.122" offset="12304996">More than that, you will notice in the brief here that the petitioners never identity who they are very odd in a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.645" offset="12335089">But we never know who the plaintiffs are, who the petitioners are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.461" offset="12346374">The reason for that, I think, is that when this case began, two Arkansas based truckers, Jones, for example, and Cawood, who are named petitioners here, were base-registered in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.405" offset="12398097">A couple years later, as Exhibit 3 in the State Supreme Court shows, they just registered and got their license plates from other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.610" offset="12434982">Now they are in the out of State class, because truckers can base register wherever they have a telephone, basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.514" offset="12462567">It has nothing to do with intra versus interstate commerce, and it is not a question of residency or favoring local commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.020" offset="12492556">So that is the way this case shapes up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.305" offset="12501751">And what we have got... I notice there is an analogy of football, a football analogy, that the petitioners use here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.459" offset="12526306">They talk about the University of Arkansas, and people being charged three times as much to go to see the game, and it is not an answer to say, well, even though they were charged three times as much, take a look at what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.245" offset="13573502">This is a commerce clause violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.347" offset="13581862">Does it bring with it, a right to receive retroactive monetary awards in the form, in these cases, of taxes?</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.453" offset="13610283">The commerce clause is only a grant, of authority to Congress, and whatever its negative implications are, they do not carry with it a license to the judiciary, the Federal judiciary, to create damage remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.761" offset="13659498">It is ironic in this case, now that Arkansas has conformed its statute to the requirements of this Court, that to require that kind of relief, petitioners say, well, they can just raise their taxes on heavy trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.870" offset="13719997">But to do that would put in Arkansas a barrier... the kind of barrier or a similar type of barrier that this court has talked about in Scheiner, to keep other trucks out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.642" offset="13759076">Arkansas has a 2.5 cent per mile tax now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.716" offset="13807351">That means that, Arkansas would have to raise its tax to collect that, if we are talking about a fiscal year, to somewhere in the neighborhood of 15, 16, 17 cents a mile... assuming that any interstate trucker would be fool enough not to go around Arkansas after that tax was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.661" offset="13875165">That creates a barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.595" offset="13878926">Is that the way the commerce clause should be enforced to preserve Congress' prerogative?</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.915" offset="13904108">If Congress had legislated Scheiner, they would not have made that decision retroactive, and we cited legislation in our brief to show that when Congress does legislate with respect to State taxes, it makes its decision prospectively only, prospective only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.825" offset="13963772">Indeed, in the railroad area, when Congress legislated and found certain State taxes to be a burden on interstate commerce, they gave the States three years to adjust their State property system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.582" offset="14014867">Now, here, all we are asking for is prospective only, in terms of what the relief ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.588" offset="14046841">And it is not that these truckers suffered, because they made $115 million a year as a result of Arkansas' decision to open its highways up to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.700" offset="14423318">State sovereign immunity is clearly not the ground of the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3581.207" offset="14473369">I think Mr. Randolph has confused the cause of action, which is a State cause of action for refund, with the defense of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.447" offset="14502312">It is clear that we have a cause of action for a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.315" offset="14513806">What I believe has not yet been passed upon by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and I think its silence is significant, because normally sovereign immunity would be decided as the ground of decision if it existed... sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.473" offset="14562394">They have held that the provision of the Constitution does justify refunds, thus reach refunds against, counties and cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.979" offset="14596458">They have held that the provision does apply to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.265" offset="14605548">They have not yet addressed the question of whether it applies to refunds from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.899" offset="14620072">Now, finally, Mr. Randolph says that the commerce clause does not reach the discrimination between Arkansas-based interstate operators anti non-Arkansas interstate operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.438" offset="14666257">That is totally inconsistent with Scheiner itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.992" offset="14680467">That kind of discrimination is clearly reached by the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.044" offset="14696663">The only people who maintain this claim, this claim, are the non-Arkansas based people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.030" offset="14720591">Now, I think it is also relevant, and we have answered, I think, everything that Mr. Randolph has said today... we have addressed in our reply brief, so I will not try to cover all those things, and I cannot in the time I have.</text>

            <text syncTime="3676.436" offset="14854234">Justice O'Connor in your opinion in Scheiner itself, you expressed a concern about the effect on the State budget of refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.441" offset="14882237">And I think it is important to understand, first of all, the refunds do not all have to be paid in a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.161" offset="14905120">We are not talking about, raising a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.878" offset="14912017">The refunds can be spread out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.463" offset="14918391">They can be financed by bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.863" offset="14923929">Not a word was said about the various ameliorative steps that can be taken.</text>
