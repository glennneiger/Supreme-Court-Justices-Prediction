            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="139581">We'll hear argument next in No. 87-201, Gerald E. Mansell v. Gaye Mansell Forbes.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.717" offset="178347">Mr. Cone, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_b_cone" startTime="52.085" stopTime="199.321">
            <label>Mr. Douglas B. Cone</label>
            <text syncTime="52.085" offset="347829">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.478" offset="361413">The question is whether California may divide Major Mansell's VA disability benefits as community property just because he is... was a military retiree as opposed to civil service or some other kind of retiree.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.345" offset="408956">And the question arises because of the unique way the Federal government treats military and other uniformed service retirees concerning the VA disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.421" offset="449184">The military, and other uniformed members, are required to waive a portion of their longevity retirement in order to receive VA disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.407" offset="485129">In effect, the military retiree is required to purchase his own VA benefits with part of his longevity pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.194" offset="516267">No other class of federal employees is required to make that selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.565" offset="533821">So we're dealing with a problem that's unique to the military services here.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.808" offset="546778">Concerning the facts of the case, the parties were married in 1954, and Major Mansell was commissioned two years later in '56.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.895" offset="587111">They had six children and he retired in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.826" offset="602784">At the time of retirement, he applied for a VA disability rating, and he received that.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.761" offset="622533">In 1977, the parties separated and the children remained with Major Mansell but no child support order was made from the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.898" offset="671121">Spousal support was ordered and the amount was equal to half the VA and half the retirement amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.622" offset="697974">Two years later a judgment of dissolution was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.264" offset="712603">Once again Major Mansell received custody of the... then one remaining minor child.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.767" offset="734546">But once again, the mother was not required to pay any child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.130" offset="748025">The husband agreed to divide the retirement and VA disability, in essence continuing the same level of spousal support, this time in the form of a property division.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.967" offset="791388">The court retained jurisdiction over distribution of those retirement benefits and the VA benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.062" offset="815734">After this Court issued the McCarty decision, Major Mansell went back to court with a motion to modify the judgment, to delete the paragraph that referred to division of VA disability and longevity retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.430" offset="865263">That motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.249" offset="872577">The decision was affirmed in the court of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.562" offset="881772">The state supreme court refused to hear the case, and this Court noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.307" offset="904760">The basic heart of the problem in this case is the way California treats military retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.199" offset="932345">They can--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="199.321" stopTime="236.314">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="199.321" offset="936838">Before you even get into that, the, the... the appellee has raised an argument in, in reply to the government's second brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.887" offset="979052">If I understand it correctly it's that this is res judicata, and that we really don't have to get into what, what the law meant after McCarty or after the statute in response to McCarty was enacted, that the California courts have passed on it before McCarty was decided, and the, the matter's closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.593" offset="1069854">Is, is this the first time that argument's been raised?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.794" offset="1078735">It wasn't in the principal brief--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_b_cone" startTime="236.314" stopTime="443.740">
            <label>Mr. Douglas B. Cone</label>
            <text syncTime="236.314" offset="1084796">--Well, no it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.947" offset="1091274">As a matter of fact, Your Honor, the res judicata argument and some associated collateral estoppel arguments as well have been raised by the appellee at every stage, the trial court, the court of appeal, and as a matter of fact the appellee's brief specifically refers to the fact that he did raise these issues in all of the courts below and they were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.034" offset="1203705">In other words, the California Court of Appeal for the Fifth District reviewed his collateral estoppel and res judicata claims and determined as a matter of state law that it was required to reach the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.943" offset="1263264">Under California law, there is a procedural device for a motion for modification... or to vacate and enter a new and different judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.440" offset="1297328">And that's the procedure that the court of appeals took this case to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.962" offset="1311330">Furthermore, the original judgment reserved jurisdiction over the distribution of the assets we're talking about here, so that the res judicata wouldn't apply because the court had reserved jurisdiction to make further orders on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.514" offset="1385622">California... a law... allows the type of motion we've brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.218" offset="1408401">And furthermore even, even if this were a final judgment with no jurisdiction reserved, and res judicata would normally apply, it wouldn't apply to this case because we're talking about application of a state law that's preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.706" offset="1462317">It's void, it's of no effect, and can be collaterally attacked at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.080" offset="1479872">Furthermore, this Court's own precedents allow for this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.912" offset="1499202">For example, the Ridgway case, a portion of a stipulated family law judgment was vacated by this Court even after the military retires died.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.861" offset="1542983">So the res judicata arguments have been raised at every level below, and rejected at every level below, principally relying on state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.826" offset="1582794">And it set out in the jurisdictional statement, in the opinion, I believe, it's pages D5 and D6, where the Court addressed the issue and found that it was required under state law to arrive at the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.325" offset="1632845">Now, returning, the heart of the problem centers around the way California treats military retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.484" offset="1681432">They consider military retirement to be deferred compensation for past services, and therefore vested property right, subject to division.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.188" offset="1716332">And they... they hold this in spite of the fact that this Court, and every other federal court who has ever addressed the issue, has held that military retirement pay is current reduced compensation for current reduced services.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.839" offset="1782892">The problem is further compounded by the fact that California refuses to recognize the fact that the retirement pay is waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.126" offset="1828032">It no longer exists for... if the veteran is disabled and takes the disability election.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.022" offset="1859588">So that California is dividing a non-existent asset, giving half of it to the former spouse and forcing the service member to pay it out of whatever assets might be left.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="443.740" stopTime="470.488">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="443.740" offset="1914445">--Well, certainly, under the savings clause of the federal act, the wife's proposed interpretation is certainly an arguable one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.629" offset="1962092">California may indeed have the right, as other states do, to determine the nature of the community property interest and to make a division, even though it can't be garnished out of the disability benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.488" offset="2021442">Well, to, to begin with, number one, it's not a property right, it's income earned after the termination of active service.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.224" offset="2528427">And they had some options.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.295" offset="2536681">There had been some, some other areas of the law where this same kind of question came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.407" offset="2561132">For example, the CIA retirement statute has, has a similar set of problems with retired spouses, and they have their own retirement... spouse's protection plan, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.108" offset="2619960">And the system that was chosen for the CIA is described in 50 United States Code Section 403, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.254" offset="2656531">In the legislative history, in talking about the enactment, it's very similar to the kinds of problems that were addressed in the McCarty decision, and in the amici and the appellee's brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.572" offset="2709821">And Congress said about that, concerning specifically the former wife, both their support of the CIA employee spouse and their direct contribution... and Congress was referring to the agency... often prevented the former spouse from acquiring marketable job skills and pension rights and imposed familial pressures and tensions which often contributed to the breakdown of the marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.130" offset="2804071">Now, their solutions to that problem, which is the same problem we have here, was to enact 50 USC Section 403 that provides a retirement benefit for the former spouse equal to 50 percent of the agent's retirement, but paid for out of the retirement fund, not out of the agent's retirement money.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.283" offset="2892678">Congress also had another possibility in front of it when it was considering the Former Spouses Protection Act, and that was Senate bill 1453.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.508" offset="2933534">And the title of that bill was, Non-preemption of State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.860" offset="2947013">And it was a one-sentence statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.412" offset="2957148">And what it would have said was, in essence, the state law shall be dispositive of all matters pertaining to retirement pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.027" offset="2983689">So it had these two extremes.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.970" offset="2991421">They could pay the former wife out of the treasury, like they did for CIA agents, or they could pass a one-sentence law that says, the federal government doesn't want to be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.637" offset="3030082">They didn't pick either one of those options.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.648" offset="3038128">What they did was design a very precise, carefully managed system for disposable retired income.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.003" offset="3079506">And they defined disposable to exclude a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.824" offset="3090791">And among the things that it excluded is VA and the taxes and a number of other things that I can set out forth a whole list, if you'd like.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.871" offset="3134990">But, but the answer is that this Court invited Congress to provide more protection, if Congress thought the former spouse should have some.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.748" offset="3170517">And they had some options in front of them, various ways they'd done things in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.300" offset="3184727">And they selected this one as opposed to any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.104" offset="3199983">So I think, just reading the plain meaning of the law that they did pass demonstrates that they only meant to allow disposable retired pay to be divided, as opposed to these other things they could have done that were before them at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.792" offset="3258706">Starting with the language of 3101, which is the... the anti-attachment statute though, I think just analyzing the language of that shows that those benefits can't be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.781" offset="3314608">In the first place, it says the benefits are not assignable, except to the extent specifically authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.806" offset="3346791">There's nothing in any statute anywhere specifically authorizing VA disability to be attached or in any way levied on or court-ordered allotments like we have in the present case, or for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.949" offset="3423277">The statute also ways that the benefit shall be exempt from taxation and the claims of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.973" offset="3447414">Well, what we have here is a property division claim, not alimony, not child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.647" offset="3470089">So it's just a creditors' claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.440" offset="3477299">The statute says specifically that the benefits are exempt from creditors' claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.351" offset="3500913">The statute also says that the benefits shall not be liable for attachment, levy, or seizure by any process, either legal or equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.530" offset="3537694">Now, the ex-wife is arguing that California is doing nothing to the VA disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.783" offset="3566637">Nevertheless, the order in the present case requires Major Mansell to initiate an allotment directing the federal government to pay the money directly to the former wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.540" offset="3605717">It's, in essence, a constructive trusts, if you will, and the government is the trustee paying the money directly to the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.036" offset="3643646">Well, that's a seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.919" offset="3855238">So we're not talking about something that you have to get 20 years into service to get.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.636" offset="4254076">But the child's benefit does not terminate, so that if you just go on with your longevity benefit the child gets nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.131" offset="4280094">So there's that incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.432" offset="4289289">Also, if the disabled veteran is unable to work because of that disability, then there are major educational benefits under the federal law for the child that would not otherwise be available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.537" offset="4385628">And for example, they get first priority in farm and home loans at way below market interest rates, but you have to have a VA disability rating to get that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.957" offset="6643339">And the governmental interest that Congress set up when they established veterans' benefits was to try to compensate the veteran who has been injured, and as a result of that injury is now less employable, less able to earn an income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.097" offset="6699868">That is still guaranteed under the approach of California law, because the money is still guaranteed to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.421" offset="6729230">And the fact that Congress did not intend to protect the other wealth is reflected by the fact that they require a waiver of a longevity pension.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.335" offset="7124828">Then they would divide the longevity pension of $2,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2427.686" offset="9850236">The purpose of this provision is to place the courts in the same position that they were in on January 26th, 1981, the date of the McCarty decision, with respect to the treatment of non-disability military retired or retainer pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.203" offset="9904361">The provision is intended to remove the federal preemption found to exist by the United States Supreme Court and permit state and other courts of competent jurisdiction to apply pertinent state or other laws in determining whether or not military retired or retainer pay should be divisible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.742" offset="9962458">However, there is no limit or a spouse's or former spouse's right to deal with a portion of a member's retired or retainer pay after the spouse, or former spouse, receives that pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.981" offset="10003418">That is a quote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.905" offset="10043124">But what the significance of that section is is that it was an intention to reflect that there was never an intention on the part of Congress to preempt the state courts in dealing with retirement pay in family law matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.064" offset="10087741">And once the state courts have started to do that, preemption has been taken away, they should be able to deal with it as they have always.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.999" offset="10119506">And the law in California, prior to the McCarty decision, was, as I have explained it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.702" offset="10134343">And it has been for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.172" offset="10140195">And there was a return to that after the passage of FUSFSPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.395" offset="10153152">That is that a person who has a unique control of a community property asset might not dissipate that asset at the expense of the other spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.739" offset="10186484">And that is what we're asking this Court to find, that states should have the right to return to pre-McCarthy law, based on the enactment by Congress showing a congressional intent, to allow the states then to divide the benefits as the states feel are appropriate under family law rules of the particular states involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.450" offset="10249282">I think the entire scheme of FUSFSPA reflects an intent on the part of Congress to make it a garnishment statute and not merely to limit the abilities of the state courts to divide pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.076" offset="10291810">And in this respect, the second brief filed by the Solicitor General shows that there are two reasonable interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.380" offset="10309050">However, there are a couple of provisions that the attorney... Solicitor General in the second brief failed to, I think, take into account properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.335" offset="10336845">And I think that they are found at the general provision of allowing payments on judgments entered June 25th, 1981, and earlier, to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.851" offset="10386895">Well, the Solicitor General reflects that that was merely an attempt to allow the garnishment, and was not a... reflective of an intent by the part of Congress to show that there was never any preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.220" offset="10436423">That doesn't make sense because the effective date of the act was February 1st, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.015" offset="10455545">If it was intended to be, as the Solicitor General indicated, then how can you apply it to pay that had already been paid almost two years earlier?</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.970" offset="10487414">That pay has come and gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.750" offset="10494520">It cannot be garnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.902" offset="10499117">The only reason for that particular reflection of a date in the statute was to show that Congress specifically intended to remove the preemptive effect of McCarty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.495" offset="10529524">There can be no other reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.027" offset="10539659">Also, I think there are specific provisions contained in the act itself, one of which was referred to by Justice O'Connor, and they can be found at Section 1408, subsection (e)(5) and (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.305" offset="10588770">Basically what they say is that if a person submits a court order that is irregular on its face, or shows that it should be paid more than the 50 percent limit, that order will not be deemed in violation of the act, and will still be followed and still be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.836" offset="10646866">And there will still garnishment go into effect, to the extent of the limits of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.037" offset="10659718">So that in essence saying that an appropriate order, even if it says more than 50 percent of the disposable retired pay, is still a valid state court order, and in fact the rest of the act shall... indicates that--</text>
