            <text syncTime="8.259" offset="119579">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.018" offset="150612">The question for decision is what statute of limitations governs a claim of a Union member alleging that the Union, in violation of Section 101(a)(2) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, denied him his right to free speech as to Union matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.156" offset="231174">Now, Congress did not enact the statute of limitations applicable to such actions and therefore under our precedents, we must decide whether the governing statute of limitations is the 6-month period that applies to the filing of charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging unfair labor practices or whether as the District Court here held.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.726" offset="337440">The Union memberâ€™s claim is more a keened to a civil rights claim in an unfair labor practice charge provided that it is governed by North Carolina statute of limitations for personal injury actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.038" offset="390625">The District Court held that the personal injury statute applied, but the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the 6-month period applied and reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.127" offset="435033">We granted certiorari and we now reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.313" offset="455722">We hold that claims under Section 101(a)(2) are governed by state general or residual personal injury statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.830" offset="489786">Our reasons are set forth at length in an opinion filed today with the Clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.254" offset="507549">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion, and Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
