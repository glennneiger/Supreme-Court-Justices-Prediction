            <text syncTime="70.457" offset="417756">I was appointed trustee in both of these cases, Your Honors, and in both of these cases as Trustee, I analyzed the cases to see what assets were available or that should be liquidated by the Trustee in these proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.935" offset="635617">That case was voluntarily... it was voluntarily changed to a Chapter 7 proceedings by the debtor in possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.061" offset="832163">In that case I made demand upon the state to collect the preference payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.135" offset="856404">Again, I was refused, and as Trustee I brought a cause of action in accordance with 11 U.S.C. 547(b) and 558.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.344" offset="1485224">It seemed that they worked on 106 over a long period of time because at the beginning they were only dealing with 106(a) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="346.741" offset="1522840">That was a situation where they knew that... they had 106(a) and 106(b), and they came up with a conclusion that the state by filing a proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court asking for something from the court, acknowledging the jurisdiction of the court by filing a proof of claim, therefore, they would waive their sovereign immunity claim, and they would give the court the jurisdiction to, in 106(a), utilize the... by means of a compulsory counterclaim the ability of a debtor or a trustee to recover retrospective monetary damages from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.564" offset="1730148">That is, if the state filed a proof claim alleging there was $100 owed to it under a contract and the trustee under that same contract or debtor in possession or debtor had a claim for $1,000, that by means of a compulsory counterclaim the estate or the debtor would collect $900.</text>

            <text syncTime="2406.118" offset="9760398">So, I think if that's what was going on in the minds of the draftsmen, perhaps it makes a certain amount... amount of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.573" offset="9786207">The big point here, though, I think is that the interpretation of the statute that we advance I think is supported by the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.899" offset="9815464">It's supported by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.548" offset="9822047">It's supported by the canons of construction that waivers of sovereign immunity are supposed to be construed narrowly if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.033" offset="9848065">And the mere fact that there is, as the Second Circuit, I think demonstrated, a credible interpretation that does not support petitioner's contention, suggests that Congress does not clearly waive the sovereign immunity of either the states or the federal government under this particular statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2446.717" offset="9922775">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.245" offset="9964884">The State of Connecticut supports the United States in its interpretation that Congress did not intend to award money damages against unconsenting states in federal court under the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.885" offset="10023398">We also believe with the opposite conclusion that if Congress did intend to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to the bankruptcy clause, that that would not pass constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.223" offset="10080763">It is because it is our contention that the Eleventh Amendment prevents Congress from abrogating the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to money damages in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.603" offset="10126321">And that's for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.794" offset="10135098">The bankruptcy clause, in both its language and its history, is not directed at states, nor is it directed at limitations at state... of state activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.083" offset="10188179">And, number two, the bankruptcy clause was enacted prior to the Eleventh Amendment and is, therefore, subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.609" offset="10230288">In stark contrast to the 10 amendments before the Eleventh Amendment, the Eleventh Amendment is, in essence, a protection of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.339" offset="10281279">The core under the modern case law of the Eleventh Amendment is the protection of unconsenting states from jurisdiction by federal courts in money damages claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.103" offset="10408339">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.082" offset="10412205">The... the core of the Eleventh Amendment is the protection of states and the federal system and the recognition of the appropriate spheres of sovereignty of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.315" offset="10477198">In the 191-year history of the Eleventh Amendment, this Court has allowed Congress to override the Eleventh Amendment with only one other constitutional provision, and that is the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.636" offset="10542399">In the 1976 case of Fitzpatrick versus Bitzer, this court noted that the Fourteenth Amendment represented a shift in the federal-state balance under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.688" offset="10598615">The Court said that through the enforcement provision of section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Congress could abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.563" offset="10650128">The question is, how far does that holding go?</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.247" offset="10664861">Does any grant of power to Congress have the effect of possibly overriding the Eleventh Amendment and thereby making it a nullity?</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.132" offset="10700388">Does it extend to the possibility that Congress by a majority vote could override what Article V sets out, which is a procedure for amending the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.851" offset="10743333">I would posit that Fitzpatrick does not go that far and that that the opinion of Fitzpatrick is the limiting principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.309" offset="10777083">Fitzpatrick says that the Fourteenth Amendment is by its express terms directed at the states and by its own terms is a limitation on state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.285" offset="10829015">If you look to the Fourteenth Amendment language, it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.149" offset="10844479">"Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protections of the law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.726" offset="10898814">Section 5 of that amendment says that</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.789" offset="10915010">"Congress shall by appropriate legislation enforce the provisions of this article. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.784" offset="10939043">So, the Fourteenth Amendment, enacted after the Eleventh Amendment, makes the Eleventh Amendment subject to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.231" offset="10976868">The bankruptcy clause, on the other hand, is of a different sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.534" offset="10994004">The bankruptcy clause addresses economic issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.617" offset="11010409">The concern of the drafters of the bankruptcy clause was a uniform law of bankruptcy to deal with the discharge of debtors across the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.825" offset="11051160">The language of the clause says that Congress shall establish a uniform law on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.313" offset="11085119">It is not by its language directed at states, nor does it affect state activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.328" offset="11113227">As a matter of fact, the history of the... of the bankruptcy clause does not either prohibit state activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.505" offset="11149903">In the 19th century there were many years when we did not have a federal bankruptcy code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.079" offset="11172159">In those instances states enacted their own bankruptcy codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.392" offset="11189505">And, on many occasions, this Court affirmed the authority of those state to have those codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.157" offset="11216567">In the 1819 case of Sturges versus Crowninshield, Chief Justice John Marshall said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.723" offset="11242794">"It is not the mere existence of the bankruptcy power, but its exercise by Congress that contravenes that exercise by states. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.811" offset="11291173">So, we have both the language and the history of the bankruptcy clause not prohibiting state activity in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.807" offset="11327118">Significantly with section 106 of the bankruptcy clause that is at issue in this case today, Congress specifically said that it did not feel it had the authority to abrogate or to waive the state's sovereign immunity completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.658" offset="11398484">Additionally, the bankruptcy clause, as prior enacted to the Eleventh Amendment, is subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.493" offset="11425860">In conclusion, when we're attempting to harmonize both the Eleventh Amendment with the other provisions in the Constitution, the Fitzpatrick versus Bitzer holding makes good sense, where those situations where other constitutional provisions have language that are directed at states, that limit state authority and that have specific enforcement provisions directed at Congress, those provisions, those provisions can then have the vindication of federal rights through money damages actions against states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.978" offset="11579774">But if you have a provision in the Constitution that is like the bankruptcy clause, which is not directed at state activity, then you have to accommodate different competing interests and that those federal rights, those federal issues can be vindicated through declaratory or injunctive relief, suits by the United States government, inducements of waiver as you see with the federal regulatory scheme, all of these things are available to harmonize the public policy of those constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.901" offset="11723447">So, in conclusion I'd like to say that Congress did strike the right balance when it enacted the Section 106, and we believe that our interpretation of the bankruptcy clause in the Eleventh Amendment is the proper interpretation of section 106(c), and I would today respectfully request you to affirm the decision of the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.976" offset="12363761">But there's an amicus brief by In re Inslaw which goes into it in much greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.786" offset="12383091">I might say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.698" offset="12386644">In addition to the... the specific language of the statute, Senator DiConcini in his remarks when 106(c) was eventually enacted clearly said you could look... you can go after preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.979" offset="12455816">I mean, there can't be any clearer words in the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.136" offset="12492388">Not... and he also has words in it that it says there's other situations, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.159" offset="12512554">Now, the... the case of Fitzpatrick versus Bitzer does deal with the Fourteenth Amendment, and certainly there is nothing that has dealt with the Article I, section... with the bankruptcy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.058" offset="12572114">But then, again, this code section has only been in existence for 10 years, and prior to that it would not have come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.654" offset="12602520">But I say this, with the vast scheme that Congress is looking to... after all, we have our senators, representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.802" offset="12635121">They can decide whether or not they want a bankruptcy code, whether or not they should have all the creditors be involved, whether or not one creditor can stand aside and say yes, you can determine what we owe, but there's no way you can ever collect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.535" offset="12701994">As an example, in the Eastern case, if the state is owed money, there's nothing to stop them from going after it.</text>
