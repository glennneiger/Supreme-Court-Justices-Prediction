            <text syncTime="76.381" offset="450404">After briefly describing the facts of our case, I would like to explain why the Wyoming court should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.420" offset="482587">If you have before you the cert petition itself, and the last page of that petition is a fold-out map showing the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.878" offset="524487">And following along with that, let me make my explanation clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.097" offset="541310">The reservation itself is located in northwestern Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.465" offset="558760">It's about 45 miles southeast of Yellowstone National Park and Little Small River in Yellowstone National Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.702" offset="579762">The boundaries that you see on that map are about 60 miles from east to west and about 50 miles from north to south.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.641" offset="615498">The reservation itself was set aside by treaty with the Shoshone in 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.962" offset="636813">There were approximately 2,400 Indians that are part of a band of Shoshone that were living to the west of the present reservation site.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.866" offset="668369">Ten years later, in 1878, the Arapaho were forcibly placed on the reservation, to which the Shoshone strenuously objected and for which they received compensation in the 1930s for the loss of one-half of their reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.927" offset="736601">During the remainder of the 19th Century, there was every little development on the Indian Reservation, while around the Indian Reservation substantial non-Indian development took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.968" offset="780800">So that by 1900, when only roughly 1,700 Indians remained on the reservation despite the fact that both tribes were now permanently located there, the Indians were desperate to get started in farming in earnest.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.811" offset="844121">And Congress and the federal officials and the Indians themselves were very anxious about the availability of water to carry on that farming simply because of all the non-Indian irrigation development around the Reservation appeared to have called for more water than would allow the Indians to continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.453" offset="1306698">First was to open the reservation to non-Indian settlement in the portion that's marked as ceded on your map.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.885" offset="1392484">The second purpose was to take the proceeds that were enjoyed from the sale or the eventual lease of those lands and use them for the benefit of the... of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.407" offset="1430518">And one of those benefits was to acquire water rights under state law, as I explained in response to Justice O'Connor's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.061" offset="1461133">In fact, the congressional intent in this respect was so strong that when the Indian Rights Association was concerned about state rights being required for these Indian... for the Indian water rights, it was proposed in both committees of... excuse me... the committees of each House of Congress that a limited reserved right be established for the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.878" offset="1560399">And it was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.362" offset="1566355">It was not included in the 1905 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.914" offset="1576595">And, again, in 1914, a permanent reserved right was proposed for the reservation and it too was rejected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.603" offset="1607315">It was stricken on the floor of both Houses on a point of order as being a legislative matter attached to an appropriations bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.690" offset="1635736">So, Congress knew what it was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.376" offset="1642423">It wasn't merely a way to spend a little extra pocket money.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.578" offset="1655276">It was a way to effectuate congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.963" offset="1672830">After... after those water rights were obtained Congress did in fact... or, excuse me... the Federal Government did in fact construct substantial irrigation projects on the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.798" offset="2512092">That was the... the conclusion of the master, and it was the decision at the first district court judge that heard the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.840" offset="2556291">Post-trial motions were heard by a second Second District Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.542" offset="2571129">The first district court judge and the master directed their attention to the future projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.279" offset="2594012">There were about 50... of the total awards, half the land had been historically irrigated, the other half had been part of future projects that would be irrigated in the future according to the United States and Tripes evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.669" offset="2647615">And it was the future projects that the court below, the master and the district court judge were most concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.740" offset="2675932">And they suggested that... first, the master... that the future projects not be allowed to go into operation right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.929" offset="2704667">And the master observed that would be no harm to the Indians because everyone knows they wouldn't be built anyway... they not be allowed to go into operation right away but be required to go in 10 percent per decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.085" offset="2745313">That was his thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.618" offset="2751373">The... the district court judge approached it a little bit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.872" offset="2772376">He said that instead of the 10 percent phasing approach to putting these futures into effect, let's have storage, and if there is a future project that requires "x" acre feet, let's have storage in that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.114" offset="2825352">The second district court judge that heard it, rejected the storage approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.852" offset="2852311">He rejected the concept of storage because it was part and parcel of estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.506" offset="2870910">What the first district court Judge had said was that the United States under these circumstances is estopped to claim a reserved right which would, in his words, put... or, render the state water rights virtually worth less.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.647" offset="2927543">Those were his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.432" offset="2930678">So, he said if there is estoppel, to remedy that estoppel we'll have the storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.002" offset="2956905">Now, the second district court Judge said, sorry, no affirmative misconduct by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.006" offset="2980938">When they acquired these state water rights, there wasn't anything wrong with that, so there wasn't any affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.060" offset="3001209">Estoppel doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.177" offset="3005597">So by the time we got out of the district court through our post-trial motions, there were no... no conditions imposed on the water right, on the reserved water right, which would serve to protect the owners of state water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.003" offset="3060977">Now, that was completely gone and when we suggested that the sensitivity doctrine or the whole decision of this Court in New Mexico would require some inquiries as part of the quantification process into the factors described in New Mexico, the thought was by the Wyoming courts that those went to questions of purposes and they didn't go to the question of quantification.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.750" offset="3151883">The... what we suggested to the wyoming court was that the New Mexico decision and the decisions which immediately preceded that and followed it established four criteria for the... for the quantification of watery or of an implied reserved right.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.878" offset="3216458">First, that there be an inquiry into the specific purpose of the reservation, and our complaint with that was, of course, all of the restored lands were for grazing purposes, restored for grazing purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.269" offset="3265986">They were not restored for irrigation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.286" offset="3274031">And yet, the PIA doctrine was used to quantify water rights for those restored lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.356" offset="3298378">In fact, the largest of the future projects... it takes... it's about about a hundred and... excuse me... about 40,000 acres of future project is located on restored land which was restored in 1944 for grazing purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.384" offset="3358459">Yet, the water right that was quantified for it was for irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.103" offset="3381342">And that requires a remarkable clairvoyance on the part of Congress if part of this effort is to inquire into congressional intent that in 1944 water... land would be restored for grazing purposes and yet it receives an 1968 priority date for irrigation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.648" offset="3447484">The second thing that the New Mexico court... or, this Court in its decision in New Mexico, said was that there should be an inquiry into need for the water because this Court said that there had been a careful examination every time this reserved right doctrine had been applied to insure that the water was needed to keep the primary purpose of the reservation... or, the specific purpose of the reservation from being defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.567" offset="3563155">There was no evidence of need in the court below, in the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.054" offset="3589173">The thought of the United States... at trial... was all they needed to do was show PIA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.789" offset="5452121">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.391" offset="5462466">The sole question presented in this case is whether the Wyoming Supreme Court erred in following this Court's decision in Arizona I in measuring the tribe's reserved water right based on the PIA standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.632" offset="5507501">We submit that the Wyoming Supreme Court's decision was correct for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.734" offset="5523906">First, this case is indistinguishable from Arizona I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.886" offset="5536444">Second, this Court's decision in Arizona I is sensible and correct and should not be discarded or replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.357" offset="5562358">And, third, the retention of Arizona I's PIA standard is essential to insure an orderly, efficient, and certain resolution of this and other ongoing Indian water rights disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.730" offset="5603840">I would like to begin by emphasizing the question here is not a matter of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.099" offset="5621290">This Court addressed how to measure Indian water rights 25 years ago in Arizona I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.186" offset="5641666">It applied the PIA standard, relying on Special Master Rifkin's careful analysis of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.090" offset="5665280">Arizona I's logic is both straight forward and compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.109" offset="5681372">Since the United States set the reservation lands asl de to enable the Indians to become productive farmers, the natural measure of their reserved water right is the amount of water necessary to make their agricultural land productive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.389" offset="7626449">On that subject, since we're talking... since Wyoming did raise the question of the restoration of lands for grazing purposes, I think that's incorrect, and I would simply refer you again to the Special Master's Report in the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.399" offset="7678485">The petition appendix indicates in the restoration orders... there is no mention that these lands were restored for grazing purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.786" offset="8120059">But I think the treaty parties recognized that the Indians would have ample water to irrigate their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.607" offset="8143360">In fact, it's reasonable for the tribes to believe they would have had all the water in this water shed since the lane was being set aside for them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.973" offset="8240849">And that's what we've done here in 1980.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.866" offset="10104425">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.152" offset="10117486">If the time permits me today, I would like to emphasize just two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.537" offset="10135040">First, the natural understanding of the treaty at issue in this case is that the United States and the Shoshones reserve sufficient water to irrigate all of the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.261" offset="10181956">That is, their permanent homes, farmable land for both the present and for the future generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.315" offset="10206198">This vested property right cannot now be easily discarded or replaced without clear and unambiguous congressional abrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.706" offset="10247785">Second, water quantification standards other than the PIA standard either legally or infirm because they take the future out of the Winters Doctrine, as is the case with the proposed historically irrigated acreage standard, or they do not achieve the fixed present determination of Indian water rights long mandated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.952" offset="10332735">Moreover, any standard other than PIA simply is not fair or just in light of the historic and the present conditions on the Wind River Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.344" offset="10382263">Before the treaty and the Reservation's creation, the Shoshones hunted and fished in what are now three western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.014" offset="10409013">After the treaty, the Shoshone agreed to live in a very much diminished land area although this still is the third largest reservation in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.556" offset="10447151">They would subsist primarily on agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.523" offset="10467004">No evidence exists anywhere in this case that the great Chief Washike in 1868 failed uncharacteristically to consider the needs of all of his people, both the future generations as well as the present generations when he reserved lands in the best water area of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.219" offset="10537849">The only way to have considered both the present and the future generation's needs for water was to reserve at least the water necessary to farm the reservation's farmable land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.812" offset="10588213">In 1908 this Court in winters recognized that when reservations were set aside, water was set aside for all time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.084" offset="10633248">Ms. Williams, the Winters Doctrine was just an intent that this Court attributed to Congress, wasn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.921" offset="10656653">Congress didn't say in so many words, in the reservations we're setting aside the water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.225" offset="10677865">It is this Court's reading of the implied intent of Congress, and indeed the implied intent of the Indians, as the tribes submit, is that they would set aside land and sufficient water to farm all of that much diminished reservation after having prior to that time having economic opportunities to hunt and fish in a vast public... vast domain out west.</text>

            <text syncTime="2692.964" offset="10916833">We are not clear, but it was something much smaller than that size there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.916" offset="10932611">But, again, in 1868 the chief of the Shoshones had in mind to protect and to reserve water not only for the then xx.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.471" offset="11174818">Water Proviso that authorized the expenditure from the remainder of $85,000 after a per capita payment was to be made to the Indians is such clear and unambiguous congressional intent to divest the property right, the water right, that was set aside in 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.682" offset="11247648">This just makes no sense at all for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.218" offset="11261754">First of all, the $85,000 was the tribe's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.705" offset="11279726">That was money set aside from the receipts of the land sales in the open area of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.676" offset="11307625">The vast portion of that was to be spent on a per capita distribution to the tribal members at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.965" offset="11336778">Only the remainder, said the United States, could be used to purchase state water permits for the reservation at a time prior to this Court's decision in 1908 when there was uncertainty as precisely the scope of the federal reserve water right, and, indeed, the quantification of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.445" offset="11426743">Any standard against this backdrop of an 1868 right, a 1905 Act statue by Congress that does not clearly divest that right, as required by this Court, that would serve as a substitute for the PIA standard, as Wyoming submits, must be premised on the need for future water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.643" offset="11511484">That is legally unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.210" offset="11517754">It is blind to present facts, and it grossly distorts history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.814" offset="11536144">The need, the equities, as this Court pointed out in Cappaert unanimously in 1976, are not to be balanced in determining the scope of federal Indian Reserve water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.486" offset="11574910">Though not legally relevant, Wyoming suggests that the tribes nave had ample opportunity to demonstrate the amount of water needed for this reservation, ignoring utterly that over the last 80 years the Federal Government has funded irrigation projects at Wind River and throughout the west primarily for the benefit of non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.365" offset="11646381">A bias described in 1973 by the National Water Commission as one of the sorrier chapters in the history of the United States government's treatment of Indian Tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.403" offset="11686505">This federal bias is starkly in evidence at Wind River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.255" offset="11697999">Over $70 million has been spent on Irrigation projects that benefit primarily the non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.343" offset="11718270">Only $4.4 million, in contrast, has been expended by the United States government, for the Indian irrigation projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.063" offset="11745228">In these circumstances, the state simply cannot in good faith argue that the tribes have had ample opportunity to demonstrate their need for water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.936" offset="11780650">The Indians' need for water in this case now should come as no surprise to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.073" offset="11801235">In 1905 the United States, as a pre-Winters precaution, obtained permits for about 125,000 acres of land for Indian irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.279" offset="11834044">Indeed, before trial, the state argued 102,000 acres on this Reservation were PIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.332" offset="11854211">The simple fact is these tribes, under any standard, need the water awarded to them by the Wyoming Supreme Court, which, as we have shown in our briefs, is a modest award considering the amount of acres per tribal member now and over time that can be irrigated with this award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.176" offset="11917636">Agribusiness represents the only certain hope for this tribe's sustained economic future on this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.530" offset="11943027">This reservation is large, but it is remote, and it has considerable available land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.984" offset="11964866">Its only other natural resource is oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.869" offset="11976360">It is depleting very rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.388" offset="11986495">With 70 percent of the tribal members unemployed, expanded agriculture and related businesses, even if only as subsistence, can make a real difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.593" offset="12027351">The tribe... the Shoshone Tribe recently executed a contract to sell all of the barley it can produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.913" offset="12052533">In addition, many tribal members are cattle producers, but due to the lack, of grasses to feed their cattle through the winter, they currently sell those calves at less than half the weight the cattle Industry's experience shows is where the major profit lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.673" offset="12111569">Only through expanded agriculture now on the presently idle and the future lands to produce a winter feedstock... the natural grasses on the reservation are not on the winter pastures... will the cattle industry on the reservation be able to thrive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.799" offset="12172173">In short, by any definition, the tribes in this case need their future water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.453" offset="12194743">For the first time in their history, the Shoshone and the Arapaho Tribes are poised to build a sustained and productive reservation agricultural economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.509" offset="12231001">This is what their ancestors envisioned in 1868 and what the tribes must do in 1989 to alleviate staggering unemployment and poverty-related social ills on this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.352" offset="12282306">Not only will the tribal people benefit from this, but so will the regional economy as dollars flow off the reservation for machinery, retail, and for other purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.644" offset="12439458">We would argue that the Shoshones and the Arapahos should not be subject to any restrictions as to transfer of uses because no other water rights holder in this country is so similarly restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.868" offset="12484389">If the need for water in the short-term is for uses other than agriculture, we would submit that the tribes should not be restricted from doing so.</text>
