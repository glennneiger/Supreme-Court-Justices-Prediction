            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="1518.982" offset="6216886">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.853" offset="6228380">The first point I'd like to make, and I think something that has been touched on in the course of the hour and a half that we've discussed the case so far, is... is at the risk of oversimplifying our position in addressing this question of the medical services or the attorney services, this... this notion that the court ought to be in a position to decide whether the defendant or the government ought to be able to spend the money is in this context a very strange one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.356" offset="6370381">Now, Mr. Chikofsky suggests that a court ought to have the equity... equitable power to decide that the defendant needs the money more than the government was essentially his submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.833" offset="6408311">This is the government's money, as Congress has declared it to be, just as a court could not decide that Mr. Chikofsky needs an operation and I'm going to waste the money on an around-the-world trip and take my money and give it to Mr. Chikofsky, by the same token the court cannot say, we submit, under either the Constitution or the statute, that Mr. Chikofsky's client needs a better lawyer than he would get by appointment, and he needs a better lawyer more than the government needs to keep the money that is the government's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.606" offset="6543416">So, our basic position is once we decide that this is the government's money, you don't look to the balancing of hardships between the two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.954" offset="6584794">You simply decide this is the government's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.424" offset="6590646">That's the end of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.726" offset="6595870">Now, with respect to the statute, let move first since we... we didn't spend very much time on the statute during the last hour and address the... the points that Mr. Chikofsky makes and the argument also that is made by adoption by Mr. Chikofsky, but principally by Caplin &amp; Drysdale, as to the construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.837" offset="6668282">First, it is... the statute is very clear and very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.534" offset="6699106">It applies to all property that satisfies one of the three definitions in Section 853(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.651" offset="6731602">All of that property shall be... is forfeited to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.063" offset="6749261">The... that property clearly includes money that a defendant may wish to use for a variety of purposes including attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.250" offset="6790012">Now, there is no exception or no suggestion of an exception in the statute for attorneys' fees or money that the defendant wishes to use for attorneys' fees and, in fact, the reliance on the legislative history gives no support at all to the suggestion that there ought to be some kind of implicit exception for attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.457" offset="6882799">The one reference in the legislative history that the... Monsanto and Caplin &amp; Drysdale rely on is a reference in a house report which was reporting a bill, which was different in significant measure from the one that was ultimately passed, in which the House said that it was not resolving the conflict among the district courts about the question of whether the Sixth Amendment was implicated by the forfeiture of the assets of a defendant, and in which the House went on to say that the statute should not be applied in a way that would violate the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.417" offset="7062626">Now, that in our view not only does not support the view that there's an implicit exception for attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.384" offset="7094495">It merely says that the statute should not be read in a way that violates the Sixth Amendment and, therefore, as we... since we view the statute as operating consistently with the Sixth Amendment, particularly if appropriate procedures are employed, that there is no express or implied exception for attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.137" offset="7177460">That position is... is reinforced by language in the Senate report... and the Senate report was reporting on the bill that was ultimately passed, almost exactly the bill that was passed... in which the Senate discusses the Long case which was the Third Circuit case that preceded this statute and in which the... the court in that case authorized the forfeiture of funds which were in the... property that was in the hands of attorneys which were designed for the payment of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.296" offset="7290100">Now, the defendants have... Monsanto has attempted to distinguish the Long case and the reliance of the... of the Senate on the Long case on the ground that that was a sham transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.224" offset="7337852">But, in fact, if you read the Long case, there is nothing in Long that suggests in any way that it was a sham transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.339" offset="7358332">That was simply a transfer of property to... to a lawyer, which was designed for all that appears on the... in the opinion to compensate the lawyer for legal fees, for legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.548" offset="7407129">The Court upheld the forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.711" offset="7415802">The Senate report relies on Long, among other authorities, as supporting the relation back doctrine, and it suggests very strongly in our view that attorneys' fees were not intended to be given some kind of special treatment or exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.720" offset="7475883">Now, the other legislative history point that is made by the parties and amici in this case is that there is... there are indications in the legislative history that the statute was really only intended to apply to sham or fraud transfers and were not... was not intended to apply to transfers that did not constitute shams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.606" offset="7563341">And our response to this... and we've discussed this at some length in our brief... is that there is nothing in the legislative history that suggests a specific intent to limit the forfeitability to those categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.404" offset="7610571">In fact, what the Senate report states is in the one footnote that is most heavily relied on by the other side, that</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.751" offset="7651949">"provisions... this provision should be construed to deny relief to third parties acting as nominees or knowingly engaged in sham or fraudulent transactions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.429" offset="7686639">That does not suggest that that is the only way that the statute should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.871" offset="7704402">It... it includes that kind of person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.144" offset="7717568">It also includes people who are engaged in transactions that are not shams, as long as they satisfy the terms of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.746" offset="10415913">Very briefly, our point on that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.289" offset="10430123">They argue that Section 853(e), the restraining order provision, gives discretion to a district court to exclude certain funds from the restraining order; and, two, that a court must exclude from the restraining order certain property, Including that property that is necessary for attorney's fees and ordinary living expenses; and, three, that the court then must exclude from the final order of forfeiture all property that was excluded from the restraining order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.431" offset="10562721">There Is no question that the district court has discretion at the restraining order stage to modify, vacate, amend, do whatever it wants with the restraining order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.139" offset="11285477">Section C simply provides that property which is subject to mandatory forfeiture as defined in Section A, 853(a), is also subject to mandatory forfeiture when it is in... is In the hands of third parties under the relation-back doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.013" offset="11357052">And the defendants rely on a line from Section C in which it is stated that that property in the hands of a third party</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.161" offset="11397594">"may be subject to a special verdict of forfeiture. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.444" offset="11406789">And they say, aha, the word may appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.976" offset="11416820">Therefore, that must mean discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.655" offset="11423612">Therefore, that must mean discretion that can be used to invade the corpus of the forfeited funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.912" offset="11444615">In fact, it's... it's clear from reading both the... the statute in context and the legislative history that that may was not intended to give a court authority to exclude from the final order of forfeiture any funds that the court might think should not be included in the forfeited assets, whether they be for purposes of attorneys' fees or an operation or any other use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.610" offset="11547433">The authorization there is simply for the Jury and the prosecutor to seek a special verdict of forfeiture if the circumstances seem appropriate and if the Jury is convinced that forfeiture is... is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.457" offset="11598737">And, in fact, the next sentence of the statute says that any property that is found to be forfeited by the Jury in the special verdict of forfeiture must or shall be ordered forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.125" offset="11641473">If the Court has no further questions, I have nothing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward M. Chikofsky</label>
            <text syncTime="2882.399" offset="11670522">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.435" offset="11710750">I want to just touch briefly on this question Of the kind of a hearing that is... that is entitled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.932" offset="11740739">I think we and the government may be at some distinction with regard to the kind of procedural due process that is, in fact, due and that's, in fact, deprived to the defendant with regard to the initial pretrial restraining orders that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.485" offset="11822868">I think one of the reasons why we suggest that this matter ought to be remanded to Congress on Fifth Amendment Procedural due process grounds is that there's a clear Intent stated by Congress in distinguishing between the section... and Section 853(e)(1)(A) and (e)(1)(B) meaning post-indictment restraints and pre-Indictment restraints that where a post-indictment restraint is involved, as were involved here, Congress explicitly stated and the Senate report states... and this is noted in the amicus brief of the Association of the Bar at page 14 where they enumerate this discussion... that</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.812" offset="11980229">"the post-indictment restraining order provision does not require prior notice and opportunity for a hearing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.937" offset="12000709">And it said that one of the reasons was that several courts had read a hearing requirement into the predecessor statute on constitutional grounds, and that the Senate report stated that Congress intended to override these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.524" offset="12055044">So, they were, in fact, specifically attempting to do away with the right of a defendant to have a... a post-indictment hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.992" offset="12088899">And I think it's very significant, when you look at the differing protections that are provided in a pre-indictment restraint hearing and a post-indictment restraint hearing, because one of the factors that is provided in the post-indictment restraint... in a pre-indictment restraint nearing is a balancing of the equities and consideration of the relevant factors.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3006.957" offset="12168833">Well, why wouldn't it be reasonable to... for Congress to say that where post-indictment, you have a finding of probable cause by a grand jury, and before that you don't?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward M. Chikofsky</label>
            <text syncTime="3015.321" offset="12202270">Well, because of the fact that It is not required... and as he noted in our briefs, and particularly citing the Grammatikos case, that there is no requirement that the grand Jury in its return of an Indictment enumerating forfeiture counts find probable cause or even consider probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.363" offset="12278443">It's a... deemed merely to be a penalty provision not a substantive element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.169" offset="12301640">And, thus, a grand jury does not have to consider forfeiture elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.413" offset="12318567">Equally importantly, contrary to what Mr. Bryson says with regard to the enumeration of assets in an Indictment... and this is very, very crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.140" offset="12357542">If you see the RICO forfeiture indictments and some of the large narcotic type of indictments, they will track the statutory language and without specifying properties in question, they will say any and all assets that maybe part of the fruits or instrumentalities or crimes or are derived from and simply without any kind of specification, tie up everything they can find anywhere without any enumeration to the defendant or to potential bona fide purchasers as to what those assets are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.811" offset="12488154">They basically have open sesame.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.095" offset="12497349">And in most of the large RICO indictments, that's the way forfeiture counts are now framed.</text>
