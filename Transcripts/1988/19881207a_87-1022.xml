            <text syncTime="15.860" offset="208066">Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.895" offset="224158">The court of appeals in this case declared unconstitutional a body which for roughly 90 years has been... has played a central role in both the history and the governance of the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.125" offset="305137">It has been in the words of many commentators in virtually every, single serious study on this subject... and there have been many... the glue which has kept the City of New York together, the... the... the body of which has embodied the compromise that was necessary both to the creation of the City of New York at the turn of the century and also the... its continued existence as times have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.779" offset="439720">The central factor, the central consideration, the central structural point, of the Board of Estimate is that there is a combination of city-wide officials who control the majority of the votes and five borough presidents who... who control the majority of votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.058" offset="508788">And when the court of appeals declared this body unconstitutional, it simply ignored that structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.435" offset="570332">It split the body in two.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.304" offset="581826">It said the city-wides we're not going to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.589" offset="594992">It said the five borough presidents we're going to consider as if it was... as if it were a legislature, which the Board of Estimate is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.029" offset="628742">Independent of the five borough presidents and declared that body unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.516" offset="658626">That body does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.735" offset="671479">It does not exist in New York City government.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.420" offset="682241">And what the... what the court of appeals did is basically said that it was not convenient to find methodologies to judge this complex body, and so it ignored the central truth about the Board of Estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.416" offset="762280">And to understand why this is the central truth about the Board of Estimate, you have to understand how the Board of Estimate came into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.974" offset="808465">The Board of Estimate was a product of the consolidation of many independent entities at the turn of the... of the century, the consolidation of the City of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.626" offset="1031132">There are charter revisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.459" offset="1034476">There are two... basically two ways you can have a charter revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.744" offset="1043567">You could either have it by referendum, or you can have it by the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.613" offset="1059031">Both are true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.046" offset="1064778">In other words, there have been charter revisions in 1901, 1938, 1961, 1975, and I think there was one, a minor one, in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.921" offset="1112321">And I don't remember which of those were by referendum and which were by the state... by the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.574" offset="1134891">But this particular voting structure has been approved by both methods because in each time it... when the... when the... either through referendum, the people vote on the charter or the... or the state legislature votes so that in both ways this... this structure has been... has been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.571" offset="1218901">And again, if... if you look back to the history of the consolidation of the City, what you have is several independent... independent entities who cede their authority to a central government and, obviously, demand to retain some manner of meaningful voice in that... in that centralized government.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.471" offset="1326525">And the Board of Estimate was precisely the mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.606" offset="1347005">And this voting structure was precisely the mechanism which expressed that compromise to resolve the tension between the need for a broader municipality to give services, on the one hard, and the obviously understandable and legitimate desire for people to have government close to home.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.087" offset="1428925">So, this was the body that incorporated that... that compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.025" offset="1456719">And it has been in--</text>

            <text syncTime="334.762" offset="1483678">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.179" offset="1485350">Three... at the time in... in the turn of the century there were three boroughs.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.547" offset="1498829">The consolidation of the City of New York was the borough of Richmond/Staten Island; the Borough of Manhattan, which was then the City of... of New York; and the Borough of Brooklyn, which was the City of Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.771" offset="1547625">Bronx and Queens were made up of amalgams of... of towns and villages from either... what was Westchester and Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.996" offset="1592556">So, there were three counties that got together and many, many other independent entities that got together in this consolidation at the turn of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.387" offset="1634143">And it's very interesting that... I... I sort of like to look at the... the early history in a way analogous to the United States' Articles of Confederation and Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.743" offset="1679596">In 1898 when... when the body was first created, this voting structure did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.765" offset="1711674">The borough presidents didn't have a vote on this Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.717" offset="1719407">And that very fact threatened the very existence of the consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.871" offset="1740096">And there was a... you know, there was a very big uproar from the boroughs saying, in effect, we have been cheated... we have ceded our powers and we have been cheated out of our ability to have a meaningful voice in the governance.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.445" offset="1790355">And so, in 1901 there was a second charter revision which... which created the structure that we have now which has, in essence, existed to this day; that is with a majority of city-wides, a minority of borough presidents, a system which, if you look at the arithmetic, you can... with respect to all of the actions which the Board of Estimate has exclusive power over, they cannot take an action without a concurrence of... of representatives representing a majority of the people of the City of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.887" offset="1952105">Mr. Zimroth, I... I take it for many years, until about 1958, the Board of Estimate followed a system of weighted voting?</text>

            <text syncTime="476.935" offset="2052311">The change was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.802" offset="2055759">In 1901 two boroughs, Manhattan and Brooklyn, had 88 percent of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.874" offset="2088047">So, they were given a... the original structure was three votes for the city-wides, two for Manhattan and Brooklyn, and one for the other three.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.581" offset="2134963">Nineteen fifty-eight, because of the change in population, the growth of Queens primarily and the fact that Manhattan and Brooklyn no longer had 88 percent of the population, the structure was changed to, in essence, what we have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.210" offset="2201418">It was actually four and two, and then it was change just for arithmetic's purpose to two and one, but it's the same ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.114" offset="2225033">And that's what happened in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.066" offset="2236840">It has been an evolutionary process, and what has happened in the City of New York is that more and more power has been transferred from the formerly independent entities to the central government.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.777" offset="2315730">And that very process has made it even more important that... that there be some kind of a mechanism for the... for the boroughs to have a voice in the central government.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.454" offset="2374453">It has been a body that's proved to be flexible enough to deal with changing dynamics of the City of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.810" offset="2751870">I'm glad you raised the budget matters because, frankly, on reflection I wish... I wish we had said more about that in... in the briefs because there's a... I think a very serious misconception about the Board of Estimate's role in budget matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.253" offset="2813624">Just to... to sort of start with the conclusion and then to explain it, in fiscal year 1986, there were 93 votes on budget matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.442" offset="2858345">The mayor was excluded from seven of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.811" offset="2871825">Almost all budget matters include the mayor as a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.964" offset="2884468">Now I'll explain to you what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.214" offset="2893454">The budgetary process has many different facets to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.284" offset="2913725">The mayor actually is the premier person in this... in this... in this whole scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.772" offset="2939639">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="699.205" offset="2941415">Because under New York law, there has to be a balanced budget and the mayor estimates the revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.878" offset="2968060">So, once the mayor estimates the revenues, there can be no increase in the budget unless there's an increase in property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.882" offset="2996168">The only body authorized to do that is the City Council, not the Board of Estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.019" offset="3016648">The Board of Estimate plays no role whatsoever in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.554" offset="3030754">On the adoption... original adoption of the budget, the mayor proposes the budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.711" offset="3075475">And if there is going to be a change without the mayor's approval, it requires the... the joint action of both the City Council and the Board of Estimate, and one of those two bodies has to vote by a two-thirds majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.538" offset="3142767">Otherwise, there can't... there can't be any change.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.323" offset="3157918">And as I say, there can't be a... a raising without additional taxes, and the additional taxes can come only from the City Council, not the Board of Estimate.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.653" offset="3239211">Throughout the rest of the year, there are many, many changes in the budget because under New York law, the budget is... is not a mandate to... to spend.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.746" offset="3299606">And the mayor doesn't have to spend any of it or any part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.496" offset="3310577">That's not... I'm not talking about an impoundment kind of situation where there's a mandate to spend because the budget is not a mandate to spend.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.685" offset="3339312">So, that's the first point, that this budget is not what you think of ordinarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.404" offset="3358225">The second point is that the mayor and the agency heads can without any further action transfer money from one part of the budget to another part of the budget as long as it's within the same agency and as long as it's not so much as to... there's a percentage that... that can't be overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.169" offset="3445265">And if that percentage is overcome, then there has to be another budget action.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.073" offset="3468879">And on that budget action, the mayor votes on the Board of Estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.358" offset="3486016">And that's what most of the budget actions are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.222" offset="7945431">The basis of that rule is the general franchise, and this Court's fundamental doctrine that every voter is entitled to participate equally in the elective process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.613" offset="7995064">It's an individual right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.480" offset="8002483">It's not a majoritarian right in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.682" offset="8015335">And as such, yes, it is true that certain bodies may be accepted if they are special purpose bodies with limited franchise for specific issues or for affecting specific people in a... in a geographic area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.442" offset="8078342">But the reality is that where there is a general franchise, this Court has uniformly held that where governing powers are involved, limited to the point of a school board in Hadley v.... in the Hadley case, those cases make it clear that general governing bodies with a general franchise are under the one person/one vote principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.279" offset="9557709">Consequently, this... this Court has summarily affirmed a system that was adopted by a state deferring obviously to the state system in Franklin v.

            <text syncTime="2511.481" offset="10190499">But when they go out and try and create a coalition, there's no premium on getting the vote of Brooklyn of Queens where the major population is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.581" offset="12166923">In Abate v. Fundt, the 11.9 percent deviation was found tolerable by Justice Marshall and for the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.248" offset="12489588">It is certainly a constitutional system under one person/one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.767" offset="12503694">Your opinion in... in Avery v. Midland County for the Court stated as such, that the flexibility of... of... within the one person/one vote rule was the... was... was demonstrated by the fact that the case in Virginia Beach, Dusch v. Davis, was allowed to go forward because it was a totally at-large scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.215" offset="12609438">I might say that this mixed district and at-large scheme, which we've talked about as relatively popular in the United States right now, is a scheme which is growing in popularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.642" offset="12659175">In fact, it's... this mixture of at-large and district schemes is something that is completely desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.629" offset="12683103">The only thing that the plaintiffs object to in this case is the assignment of equal votes for each of the boroughs within this scheme instead of assignment for equal opportunity to participate in the electoral process by the... by the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.805" offset="12747782">And the interesting thing is here... and we can ask Mr. Zimroth this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.875" offset="12768053">I mean, you can ask Mr. Zimroth this in rebuttal, and that is what interests that he has cited for upholding the current Board of Estimate... and he has cited many interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.331" offset="12809954">He cited interests in history, in natural boundaries and integrity of subdivisions, in effectiveness, in meaningful participation, in check on executive powers, what, if any interests of those in retaining the current Board of Estimate in any way relate to the retention of equal votes for the borough presidents?</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.023" offset="12956657">The representative from Staten Island can have one vote, and the representative from Brooklyn can have six votes, or it can be apportioned in such a way that the Staten Island representative will come to the meetings because he will make a meaningful difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.783" offset="13015694">And it... I guess the... the opposite of your hypothetical is let's say we wanted to give Staten Island and absolutely guaranteed role in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.305" offset="13057803">Why not have total at-large elections and give every Staten Islander six votes; every Brooklyner; one, every Queens, two; every Bronx, three... Manhattan, three; and Bronx, four?</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.363" offset="13106078">Could we do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.529" offset="13110675">It seems to me that would be plainly unconstitutional and that is the exact import of the system that now is in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.468" offset="13142440">The point about the... about the justifications that Mr. Zimroth offers here is that none of them support this equal vote for boroughs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.276" offset="13189670">And, in fact, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, the equal votes for boroughs is a relatively new part of this scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.263" offset="13221643">This scheme, for 60 of its 90 years, did have votes roughly weighted for purposes of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.202" offset="13249438">And in 1958 when they equalized the votes, the deviations went up substantially... population deviations under the Abate method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.158" offset="13289248">The... Justice O'Connor asked whether it would make a difference whether an at-large representative was added.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.247" offset="13317565">Well, you can figure approximately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.480" offset="13326551">I can't do it because I don't have the calculator ready, but basically it's 132.9 percent if you ignore the city-wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.019" offset="13360615">It's 78 percent if you add the city-wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.138" offset="13373154">And that's three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.507" offset="13378587">So, if the difference between 70... 100... is about... 40 plus twenty is 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.494" offset="13402515">Sixty percentage points are added by three... or sorry... lowered by addition of three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.315" offset="13433862">So, four would probably bring it down to 58 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.433" offset="13446297">In fact, this Court... this Court has summarily affirmed the invalidation of a city council scheme in New York City that had 50.8 percent deviations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.144" offset="13509199">And that city council scheme had essentially exactly the same interests underlying it as the Board of Estimate scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.834" offset="13543890">In that scheme each borough had two extra city council seats assigned to the borough as borough representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.023" offset="13580670">This Court summarily affirmed in Andrews v. Koch, which is in the brief, the... the invalidation of that scheme which assigned equal... equal... two votes/two new city council each for each borough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.651" offset="13651201">And the justifications there were actually stronger because there was an added justification that the... there would be a minority party representative on each of those... one of the two would have to be a minority party representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.261" offset="13709611">It could not be a democrat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.427" offset="13714313">It would have to be some other party in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.779" offset="13727688">And the... that was thought to be a good thing, and that was offered as a justification for... an added justification besides the equal participation of the boroughs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.171" offset="13769274">So, what we have here in the end... and one should be aware of this... is many alternatives that can work for New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.942" offset="13808354">Mr. Zimroth is wrong in my opinion in saying that this is the only system that will let New York City survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.632" offset="13843149">The fact of the matter is is that I'm not sure we've done very well with it, but some say we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.452" offset="13866345">I'm not sure that effectiveness can ever be a criteria for this Court because that will place it in... more in the midst of any political thicket than it ever has been so far it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.277" offset="13913679">And it's also important to note that there is a charter revision commission standing in abeyance waiting for this Court's decision to make a determination with the many alternatives that it has already assessed and already made determinations about as appropriate to maintain the wisdom and the good parts of this mixed district and at-large scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.959" offset="14008452">In conclusion, I would just say that we know that the one person/one vote rule works at the municipal level in just this kind of system nationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.267" offset="14049621">You can't avoid by any method of computation the huge disparities that exist between boroughs that range in population from six to one... by a factor of six to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.991" offset="14100507">There's no question that the Queens and Brooklyn voter gets less responsiveness from the borough president than the Staten Island voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.412" offset="14130287">It's clear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.680" offset="14135302">And there is absolutely no evidence that the City has presented or that could be presented that the at-large city-wide officials favor the large boroughs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.654" offset="14187234">There's no evidence of that sort already, and that we hope that this Court will not accept an equal vote for boroughs, but will again reaffirm its doctrine of an equal vote for voters.</text>
