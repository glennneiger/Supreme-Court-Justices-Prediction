            <text syncTime="7.887" offset="177473">Mr. Horowitz, you may begin whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="10.448" stopTime="169.472">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="10.448" offset="187713">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.811" offset="201193">This case presents a statutory question concerning the operation of the reorganization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.763" offset="228987">For transactions that fall within the statutory definition of a reorganization, the Code provides an exception to the general rule that the entire amount of gain or loss must be recognized upon the sale or exchange of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.942" offset="277784">On the theory that the reorganization represents a recasting of interests in a continuing enterprise, not a sale, the Code provides for deferral of the gain or loss that would otherwise be recognized on the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.371" offset="327416">When the reorganization is purely stock for stock, no gain or loss is recognized at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.656" offset="352598">However, when the transaction also involves, in addition to an exchange of stock, the payment of cash or other property, what is commonly known as boot, Section 356, the provision at issue here, comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.342" offset="407351">Section 356(a)(2) provides that the gain on the transaction is to be recognized up to the amount of the boot, and it further provides that if the exchange has... and I quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="77.300" offset="455207">"the effect of a distribution of a dividend. "</text>
            <text syncTime="79.644" offset="464507">then it is to be treated as a dividend to the extent of the recipient's share of the undistributed earnings and profits of the corporation, and it is generally recognized, and Respondent does not dispute here, that the corporation whose earnings and profits are examined in this connection is the acquired corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.645" offset="536500">The facts of this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.157" offset="550606">Respondent Clark was the sole shareholder of Basin, a closed corporation that by March 1979 had accumulated more than $2.3 million in undistributed earnings and profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.914" offset="597627">N.L. Industries, a major corporation whose more than 32 million shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, sought to acquire Basin from Clark in the transaction that ultimately yielded Clark more than $10 million in gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.244" offset="650917">N.L. offered Clark two alternatives as consideration for his stock in Basin: either a complete stock for stock deal, in which he would receive 425,000 shares of N.L., or another deal in which he would receive 300,000 shares of N.L. and in addition $3.25 million in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.176" offset="730642">Clark chose the latter alternative including cash, explaining that he needed cash to pay outstanding bills and that his whole livelihood had been tied up in Basin, and he didn't want everything tied up in N.L., where he would run the risk that something would happen to N.L.--</text>
            <text syncTime="160.575" offset="788321">Under Section 356, therefore, Clark was required to recognize and pay tax on $3.25 million of his gain.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="169.472" offset="823847">If the first alternative had been chosen, then what?</text>
            <text syncTime="172.845" offset="837326">Would you be here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="173.886" stopTime="207.737">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="173.886" offset="841506">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.654" offset="844536">There would be no tax at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.956" offset="849761">It would be tax-free... a completely tax-free transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.228" offset="858851">The bulk of the gain still remained tax-free, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.011" offset="874002">The question here is whether the cash that was received by Clark should be treated as a dividend, and therefore taxed at ordinary income rates, to the extent of the $2.3 million in earnings and profits that Clark had allowed to accumulate in Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.779" offset="929069">It is the Government's contention that the boot distribution to Clark in this case clearly had the effect of the distribution of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.883" offset="961460">A dividend, as defined by the Code in Section 301--</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="207.737" offset="976925">Mr. Horowitz, is that the basic principle of boot, really?</text>
            <text syncTime="212.311" offset="995211">Why do we have the boot principle worked into the decisional process at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="218.095" stopTime="325.113">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="218.095" offset="1018303">--Well, the idea is that... the idea of not recognizing gain in the reorganization is that it's kind of paper profits, and that the... since the taxpayer is continuing his operation of the same corporation in a different form, as long as he keeps it in stock, it's the same as if his own stock had appreciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.214" offset="1090819">He doesn't have to pay tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.386" offset="1095521">He hasn't realized anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.467" offset="1099805">But once he takes cash out of the transaction, then it becomes a taxable transaction, and he needs to pay tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.412" offset="1123629">The Code usually doesn't let people take out $3.25 million without paying any tax on it, when it actually represents gain from his initial investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.646" offset="1156543">So, there's no question that the boot is taxable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.959" offset="1169813">The only question is whether $2.3 million of it is taxable at ordinary income rates or at capital gain rates, and that turns on whether it had the effect of the distribution of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.466" offset="1207847">A dividend is defined in the Code as a distribution by a corporation with respect to its stock of its earnings and profits, and this Court has described the fundamental test of dividend equivalency as whether the distribution to the shareholders is on a pro rata basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.164" offset="1270646">Here there is no question that the distribution was made on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.577" offset="1292275">That is, Clark was the only shareholder of Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.590" offset="1304291">Now, of course, the distribution here, which was made in the course of a multi-corporation reorganization, is not literally a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.386" offset="1335534">That would be impossible, because a dividend is a transaction between a single corporation and its stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.941" offset="1361761">With that constraint, however, it is as close to an ordinary dividend as could be, and therefore, it had the effect of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.733" offset="1388928">Remember, the reason why Section 356(a)(2) needed to be enacted with the terms</text>
            <text syncTime="317.218" offset="1414842">"have the effect of a dividend. "</text>
            <text syncTime="318.490" offset="1419962">is because any money that would be distributed in the course of reorganization would not literally be a dividend.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.113" offset="1446398">Mr. Horowitz, it seems to me that possibly the Government's approach in this case divorces the boot payment from the context of the reorganization in which it occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.066" offset="1530198">--Well, we certainly don't dispute that, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.808" offset="1541170">But as I was saying, the text of Section 356(a)(2) is that you need to look at whether it has the effect of a distribution of a dividend, because in no reorganization would the distribution itself literally be a dividend, because that's a single corporation transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.868" offset="1601460">So of course the distribution occurred in the course of the reorganization, and for that reason, it is not literally a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.582" offset="1624344">The Code directs you to look at whether it has the effect of the distribution of a dividend, and in order to do that, you must compare it with an actual distribution of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.098" offset="1662378">And that requires a comparison to a transaction that necessarily takes place outside of the reorganization, because dividends are--</text>

            <text syncTime="823.299" offset="3439122">First of all, we don't necessarily say that you have to hypothesize a redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.972" offset="3453855">That is Respondent's construct.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.253" offset="3462946">They argue that somehow you'd have to trade a redemption, and what the statute says is whether it has the effect of a dividend, which the dividend is a much simpler transaction than a redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.799" offset="3493144">And we say that you look at a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.750" offset="3500980">Now, the simplest way of looking at is true, as if Basin had in fact distributed this as a dividend before the reorganization, because Basin ceased to exist as an independent entity after the reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.849" offset="3549359">But our position does not depend on looking at it before the reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.132" offset="3570466">This is explained in some detail in my reply brief, pages 7 to 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.134" offset="3586558">But you could also structure the transaction somewhat differently the way the Minnesota Tea case that was before this Court was structured, and that is, Basin could have been kept as a shell corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.994" offset="3637966">All of the assets of Basin could have been sent to N.L. in the reorganization with Basin remaining as a shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.127" offset="3658446">And in that case, the consideration paid for the organization would have gone into Basin as a holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.761" offset="3689062">It would have held the shares in N.L. and it would have taken the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.883" offset="3701496">It still would have all been to the benefit of Clark, which would remain the sole shareholder of Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.397" offset="3719573">In that case, if Basin then distributed the money as a dividend to Clark, which is what happened in the Minnesota Tea case, it would clearly be a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.371" offset="3759488">There would be no argument that it wouldn't be a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.964" offset="3765862">Yet everybody would end up in exactly the same place as they are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.226" offset="3778923">So, whether you compare what happened here on the reorganization to a pre-reorganization distribution by Basin, or if you compare it to the post-reorganization transaction, that I just described, in either case there, it is exactly comparable to a dividend.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.816" offset="4265219">We think there's no denying that it has the effect of the distribution of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.197" offset="4278802">Now, Respondent's argument is that it may also have the effect of some other transaction that they're able to dream up, one that is not a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.454" offset="4311821">But that doesn't get around the statutory problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.576" offset="4324255">Statute says that if it has the effect of the distribution of a dividend, it's to be treated as a dividend, and the statute doesn't care whether it could have the effect of some other transaction which they hypothesize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.612" offset="4364380">So, we think whether or not you think that the Respondent's hypothetical way of looking at it is as good as ours or not, it does not help them in dealing with the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.810" offset="5253170">Let's look at what happened here with the two transactions, and I think it should be clear enough that this has the effect of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.946" offset="5289741">We start out with Basin having $2.3 million in earnings and profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.487" offset="5307922">That $2.3 million was distributed on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.340" offset="5327358">The only difference between that and the prototype dividend, where the distribution was actually made by Basin, is that the distribution was made by a corporation that's a continuation of Basin in a recast form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.240" offset="5374900">The effect is certainly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.791" offset="5381170">At the end of the day, whether the dividend was paid directly by Basin outside the reorganization, or paid in the course of the reorganization as it was here, $2.3 million has disappeared from the corporation and ended up in the pockets of Clark, Basin's sole shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.159" offset="5438639">I'd like to make... there are several points we make in our brief that are critical of the hypothetical redemption scenario that is posited by the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.019" offset="5490048">For one thing, it does not have... it does not fit the statutory language of having the effect... the reorganization transaction does not have the effect of the transaction that they posit, because many of the categories that are relevant for tax purposes would come out quite differently... the amount of the gain, the amount of the basis, the amount of continuing earnings and profits accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.152" offset="5570610">There's one, that stuff is in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.913" offset="5581581">There's one thing that I would like to focus on here in oral argument, though, and that is the question of the earnings and profits that is required to be compared by Section 356(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.810" offset="5625258">The statute says that the amount of the boot that is to be treated as a dividend is limited by the earnings and profits of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.224" offset="5658904">Now, as I said before, the corporation there has been recognized by the Courts and not disputed by Respondent as being the acquired corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.331" offset="5695266">Now, it's almost a tautology that when you have a dividend, and you compare the distribution, the dividend is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.107" offset="5734450">The earnings and profits that you look at there are those from the same corporation that's making the distribution to its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.533" offset="5764125">But what you have here, with the hypothetical redemption scenario that the Respondents have posited is they assume that the distribution was made by N.L., by the later, combined corporation, yet they want to compare that against the earnings and profits of Basin, a corporation that had no connection to N.L. at that time, in determining whether that's a distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.570" offset="5992226">So it wouldn't have even gone into the N.L. earnings and profits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.538" offset="7456128">The issue is, what is the effect of getting the cash at the time of the reorganization as a part of the overall exchange to give him a dividend?</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.850" offset="7581411">But the point is that the effect of taking the cash out is to reduce, clearly here, to reduce the amount of ownership he has in the continuing enterprise, and this Court has defined dividend not in terms of what's pro rata or not, but in terms of the impact of the distribution on ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.342" offset="7659361">In Davis, this Court said that a dividend results when a distribution produces no change in the relative economic interests or rights of the shareholders whereas conversely, there is no dividend if a distribution results in a meaningful reduction in the proportionate interest of the shareholder in the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.335" offset="7739295">But where there's a reorganization, our position is, and what the Fourth Circuit held, was that the corporation there means the only corporation that's going to continue to exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.900" offset="8133535">It's also relevant because both sections are trying to deal with the same basic question: when has getting money from a corporation sufficiently reduced the shareholder's interest in the continuing business that it has the effect of going out and selling some of that stock, so that it should be treated as a capital gain?</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.579" offset="8244295">The particular rules for the amount, how the basis is calculated and that sort of thing are determined in detail in Section 356 separately from the characterization issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.475" offset="8287867">Now, the IRS has in fact changed its position; not with respect to this exact particular case, but it is following a position in very similar other cases which is not the same as what it's following here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.900" offset="8381594">For example, there's a Revenue ruling, 75-447, which is cited in our brief, in which there is a pro rata distribution of cash by a corporation to two shareholders, each of whom owns 50 percent, and then the corporation sells additional stock to a third person, so that they end up instead of each owning half, they now only each own a third.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.655" offset="8476575">You ought to look at the continuing ownership interest in that situation, and they said the reason for that is that a correct analysis requires that effect be given only to the overall result and proscribed to the fragmenting of the whole transaction into its component parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.985" offset="8541882">And they go on to explain that the approach is needed because making the computations in this manner properly reflects the extent to which the shareholder involved in each situation actually reduces his stock holding as a result of the whole transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.625" offset="8600500">In the real, practical world, what happened here was Mr. Clark chose in effect to trade 70 percent of his Basin stock for N.L. stock and 30 percent for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.866" offset="8657447">Because it was in the context of a reorganization, special separate rules for computing the gain, it was recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.702" offset="9800775">First of all, there are classes of reorganization where only one corporation is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.456" offset="9819792">There are reorganizations where there are overlapping ownership, and there are reorganizations where two relatively equal companies are merged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.882" offset="9861483">And in all of those cases you can have a situation where the reduction will exist, but it will not be sufficient to produce... there may not be any reduction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.427" offset="9895651">But even where a reduction exists, it may not be enough to be meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.721" offset="9912892">When the Service has held, this is not the result of this case, but of lots of rulings in the past, the Service has held that a minority shareholder going down by as little as a few percent, three or four percent, that's meaningful for a minority shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.169" offset="9966600">But for a majority shareholder who continues to be able to control the corporation, he can go down quite a bit, as long as he doesn't go below a control level, and that reduction is not meaningful and that would be treated as a dividend.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.675" offset="12568709">Mr. Slocombe is now taking the position that the Court should basically ignore Section 356(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.039" offset="12594100">Obviously, if the entire corporation had been sold for all cash, it would all be capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.124" offset="12618446">However, it would be more than $10 million of capital gain that he would have to recognize on the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.726" offset="12640912">Respondent got a $7 million tax break by structuring this as a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.850" offset="12661392">$7 million of his gain is not recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.522" offset="12672050">That's because it was a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.793" offset="12681140">That's because the assumption is that there is a continuing enterprise going on here, not getting rid of his old enterprise and turning it into cash, and the corollary to that is what Congress recognized in 356(a)(2), which is if you've got a continuing enterprise, you've still got these earnings and profits sitting around in the corporation, and if you take them out, you're going to have to consider whether what you've done has the effect of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.208" offset="12770793">And that's what's happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.480" offset="12775913">As Mr. Slocombe himself said, the idea of Mr. Clark's notion was to get his money out, or some of his money out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.674" offset="12800677">What does that mean, his money?</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.883" offset="12805483">It's the money that he earned when Basin was operating as a corporation, and it's been sitting in Basin, and earning some profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.357" offset="12831397">That's the money that he's got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.769" offset="12837039">And this question of whether he bailed it out or not is not a factual issue, it's just an objective characterization of what's gone on by having the money come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.485" offset="12871939">One more point that I would like to make is this notion of whether the Government is bifurcating the transaction, or just looking at it in isolation, while Respondents arguably isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.314" offset="12919273">Obviously they're looking at it in isolation also, by focusing on this change of interest, this hypothetical change of interest, as Justice Stevens says, if he had taken more stock or less stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.931" offset="12965666">What happened here is that he went from a 100 percent owner of a corporation down to a 1.3 percent, I guess it is, owner of another corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.074" offset="12998267">Now, if you look at the whole transaction, obviously it can't make any serious difference whether he went from 100 percent to 1.3, from 100 percent to 0.9, or 100 percent to 1.15.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.703" offset="13044765">So, if you look at the whole thing, there's just this change of interest basically fails out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.586" offset="13068275">And if you try to apply the redemption provisions as they try to do, that difference becomes clear, because the reason why the Service, in these rulings that have been cited by Respondent does not require dividend treatment for a small change in interest by a minority shareholder, is because a minority shareholder... that kind of distribution to a minority shareholder is not regarded as a dividend, because a minority shareholder doesn't have the power to declare a dividend to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.025" offset="13178094">But here, Clark wants to treat himself as a minority shareholder by looking at the transaction from a post-Hope way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.560" offset="13204216">But of course he isn't, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.020" offset="13210068">He started as a 100 percent shareholder who could have declared those earnings and profits out to himself from Basin at any time, and that's essentially what's happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.774" offset="13241101">I think all of what the Respondent says about change in interest, etcetera, etcetera would all apply equally if in fact Basin had distributed this as a dividend before the reorganization... say, the day before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.614" offset="13292406">His interest in the continuing corporation would have ended up being less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.014" offset="13302019">It would all come out to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.406" offset="13307557">Yet, it would still have clearly been a dividend in the 316.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.179" offset="13322708">Yes, but you keep giving the example that if they had done it a little different... if you had also solo 30 percent of the stock for cash, and then two weeks later entered into a statutory reorganization, you would get capital gain.</text>
