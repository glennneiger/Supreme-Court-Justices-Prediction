            <label>Mr. William L. Webster</label>
            <text syncTime="11.240" offset="190723">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court, this case represents a direct appeal that involves a 1986 Missouri statute defining the rights of the unborn and regulating abortion in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.828" offset="293018">Missouri's appeal involves three basic areas for this court's review: The first, the constitutional boundaries on the limitations of public funding; the second, the effect of and the facial constitutionality of legislation declaring that life begins at conception; and, third, the ability of a state to require a physician to perform tests and to make and record findings when determining viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.154" offset="394373">Finally, we have asked this court to reconsider the standard of review to be applied to state abortion regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.648" offset="420287">Since 1973 this court has reaffirmed Roe versus Wade's mandate, state and lower Federal courts have repeatedly interpreted that mandate, frequently strictly against the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.698" offset="472532">One result is that the states have effectively been forbidden, not only to prohibit abortion but usually to regulate abortion in any significant way.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.085" offset="510043">We would begin with the public funding area where the Eighth Circuit upheld that portion of Missouri's law which declared unlawful the expenditure of public funds for the purpose of performing or assisting in an abortion but struck down three subsequent sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.582" offset="572110">The court declared first of all Section 188.205 relating to the expenditure of public funds for abortion advocacy, facially unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.021" offset="613802">We would contend to the court as we have at every level that this particular section, which we have appealed, does not go to the speech but rather is directed at the entities responsible for expending public funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.276" offset="706798">We have suggested throughout that this language is directed towards those individuals responsible for the expenditure of public funds, that it is not directed to any physician or any health care provider.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.114" offset="754236">We would note that much of Appellees brief treats it as if the subsequent two sections are still before the Court dealing with public employees and other health care providers and speech in public facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.133" offset="806272">But that's not what we have brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.986" offset="813691">We contend the government is certainly not obligated in and of itself to become an advocate for abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.942" offset="837514">This court was very explicit in Meyer when it concluded that a state is not required to show a compelling interest for its policy choice to favor child birth, normal child birth over advocacy of abortion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.921" offset="4361433">Today the United States asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in Roe v. Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.147" offset="4390376">At the outset, I would like to make quite clear how limited that submission is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.022" offset="4417857">First, we are not asking the Court to unravel the fabric of unenumerated and privacy rights which this court has woven in cases like Meyer and Pierce and Moore and Griswold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.581" offset="4476058">Rather, we are asking the Court to pull this one thread.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.546" offset="4495911">And the reason is well stated by this Court in Harris and McRae; abortion is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.219" offset="4522661">It involves the purposeful termination, as the Court said, of potential life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.815" offset="4545021">And I would only add that in the minds of many legislators who pass abortion regulation, it is not merely potential life but actual human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.391" offset="4587340">And though we do not believe that the 14th Amendment takes any position on that question, we think it is an utter non sequitur to say that, therefore, the organized community must also take no position in legislation and may not use such a position as a premise for regulation.</text>
