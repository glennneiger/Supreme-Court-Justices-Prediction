            <text syncTime="20.712" offset="231423">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.068" offset="256918">The respondents in these cases applied between 1973 and 1980 for Black Lung Benefits under Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.757" offset="295684">The claims in all instances were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.725" offset="311567">Some of them were in fact denied for the second time, but all of them were denied under the Department of Labor's so-called interim regulation which was adopted in response to the 1977 Amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.718" offset="367469">The Courts of Appeals below the Eighth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit struck down the denials of these claims on the ground that the interim regulation was incompatible with the 1977 amendments under the provision which is no codified at 30 U.S.C. 902(f)(2), which requires that the criteria under those interim standards be</text>
            <text syncTime="79.000" offset="464644">"not more restrictive than criteria applied by HEW to Part (b) claims filed before July 1, 1973. "</text>
            <text syncTime="87.689" offset="499335">The Department of Labor interim regulation is similar to the HEW rule in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.878" offset="532145">It is a presumption, and I will talk more later if I get the chance about the details of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.366" offset="554087">It also however has some major differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.068" offset="564850">One of the differences is a difference that is an issue in this case, and that is the question of how you can invoke what I will now call the causation prong of the two-prong test necessary to invoke the presumption which exists under both the HEW interim rule and the Department of Labor interim rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.564" offset="646874">Under the HEW rule, you were required to show that your pneumoconiosis was caused by coal mine employment, and you were allowed an inference, indeed, a presumption to be drawn from the fact that you had ten years of coal mine experience, a presumption that it was in fact caused by coal mine employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.811" offset="731825">The difference in this case which is relevant is that under the Department of Labor interim regulation, you simply must have ten years of coal mine employment, and there is no opportunity to prove causation in any other way in order to trigger the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.487" offset="790548">I should note and I think it is clear from the briefs, that in any event if the presumption is not invoked, there is still an opportunity to prove entitlement to benefits by going back to permanent regulations in effect, allowing you to prove all the elements, that is, total disability, pneumoconiosis, and causation by coal mine employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.532" offset="866721">Our position in this case--</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="198.946" offset="944357">--Well, the permanent regulations are different in some significant respects, and it would take a good long time to go through all the ways in which they are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.135" offset="981137">And it's enough off the point here that I would like to pass over that if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.622" offset="1011126">The position of the Government in this case is that they are not... this difference is not a more restrictive criteria because the appropriate reading of criteria within the meaning of Section 902(f)(2), looking to the legislative context and trying to make sense out of the amendments passed in 1977 is to read it as essentially medical test criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.623" offset="1115093">Now, in that regard, and in order to come to that conclusion, it is important and necessary I think to look to the background of the amendments in 1977 which were in fact... it's clear from the hearings and the debate... a political compromise which like many political compromises had an ambiguous result.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.786" offset="1191789">The main focus, if you can say that, of the debate throughout the mid 1970s was that there were different results reached under the HEW interim rules which applied to claims filed prior to 1973 and under the so-called Part B program, and the results reached under the permanent regulations which the Department of Labor was required to apply to Part C claims where the claims were filed after mid-1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.205" offset="1317385">That was the main focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.859" offset="1332014">There are different views that were taken in the legislature and in the testimony that was given of that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.597" offset="1355002">One view was the view... I can encapsulate in the notion that the Department of Labor approval rate was unreasonably low, and something had to be done about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.286" offset="1397738">Its approval rate at that time was something under 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.357" offset="1414038">One of the main focuses of that criticism was the fact that medical test criteria, specifically, the ventilatory study scores, that were applied under the HEW permanent regulations that the Department of Labor had to apply were tougher, significantly tougher, than the ventilatory study scores applied under the HEW interim presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.388" offset="1510169">That was one of the major focuses of the criticism, and a major explanation of the difference, not the only explanation, but a major one.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.626" offset="1539113">This general view that the Department of Labor approval rate was too low and something had to be done about it was embodied in the House bill which was passed in 1977, and especially, although not again solely, embodied in the language which said that they were to apply criteria</text>
            <text syncTime="367.622" offset="1619152">"not more restrictive than the criteria applied under the HEW interim presumption under Part B.. "</text>
            <text syncTime="375.395" offset="1650185">A second view, again not mutually exclusive with this first one, but certainly a very different emphasis, was a view that saw... that expressed significant doubts about the accuracy of the standards and the process that was being applied in general, and particularly, that was being applied by HEW under the interim regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.094" offset="1744958">That is to say, the extent to which... doubts about the extent to which they were really identifying cases of people who were disabled with pneumoconiosis from coal mine employment as opposed to simply paying benefits to people who were coal miners of middle or advanced years who were able to meet certain criteria that really didn't demonstrate that they had the conditions that the statute was aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.007" offset="1836595">This general view, I think it's fair to say, was embodied in the Senate bill which was passed in 1977 which called for the re-promulgation of standards, permanent standards, by the Department of Labor taking a different approach really.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.670" offset="1919247">Not so much treating it as an entitlement program as treating it as a workers' compensation program and specifically trying to identify medical tests necessary to establish whether someone is or is not totally disabled with pneumoconiosis from coal mine employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.430" offset="1982358">And specifically, they enacted in the Senate bill a provision that says the Department of Labor shall promulgate criteria for all appropriate medical tests which accurately reflect total disability in coal miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.523" offset="2042754">The conference committee put together essentially, in what really I think has to be described as an uneasy compromise, both the provisions of the House bill and the provisions of the Senate bill, and to a significant degree, tried to serve both purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.615" offset="2111090">On the one hand, they called for the promulgation of new permanent regulations in the words of the Senate bill, criteria for all appropriate medical tests to be promulgated with the consultation of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and health and to be done permanently, and they realized it would take some period of time to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.196" offset="2189353">As to the interim period, before the promulgation of those permanent regulations, I must say I think the signals were somewhat mixed as to precisely what was supposed to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.004" offset="2240657">On the one hand, the House bill's language talking about criteria not more restrictive than the HEW provision, the HEW interim regulation, was included.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.846" offset="2291962">And there's no question that they intended to move a good deal closer to approximating what the HEW administration was doing than had been done by the Department of Labor previously.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="547.571" offset="2338878">Well, Mr. Ayer, one does get the impression at least that the over-arching purpose of Congress was to make sure that miners who would have been entitled to benefits under HEW's interim Part B regulations would be entitled to benefits under Labor's interim Part C regulations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="570.417" stopTime="695.934">
            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="570.417" offset="2430306">Well, I think that that is certainly... I think there is a good deal of evidence for that in various parts of, if you pick and choose and you don't have to pick and choose too carefully, you can certainly find people who said things that indicated that with regard to the enactment of the House bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.898" offset="2508256">I think it is a good deal harder to find that supported with regard to the Senate bill because they simply didn't take any such step.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.671" offset="2539289">And I think what we need to do is to try analyze what was the intent in enacting the compromise, which was the conference bill, because that actually is what was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.494" offset="2586623">And in that regard, I would not suggest that the words are wholly unambiguous, but there are indications that they intended something which is quite a lot different than simply whatever HEW was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.738" offset="2647540">They did not want the same results that HEW achieved, and that is indicated by a number of different sources that we can turn to.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.492" offset="2678574">One is the conference report itself where they indicated, and I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="637.212" offset="2697487">"The conference substitute conforms to the Senate amendment with the proviso that the so-called interim Part B medical standards are to be applied to all reviewed and pending claims. "</text>
            <text syncTime="648.334" offset="2741999">"Such regulations, that is, the interim regulations shall not provide more restrictive criteria than those applicable to a claim filed on June 30, 1973, except that in determining claims under such criteria, all relevant medical evidence shall be considered in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Secretary of Labor. "</text>
            <text syncTime="669.850" offset="2827994">They did not say in any of the bills and certainly not in the final act as passed that they were trying to mirror precisely what HEW had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.408" offset="2874283">They did not indicate as they could easily have done had they wanted to that the Department of Labor was simply to re-promulgate the HEW interim regulation in exact terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.048" offset="2924856">It's quite clear they didn't intend that at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.934" offset="2932380">It is not clear to me, Mr. Ayer, why if you prevail in your argument that criteria means medical criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.825" offset="2979923">That we are not confronted here with the medical criteria anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.094" offset="3001029">This was raised in the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.950" offset="3032376">Well, I think the words medical criteria, as has been indicated in the briefs, is not itself wholly unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.721" offset="3071456">But I think when you look to the specific focus of much of the tension which was a very concrete difference in ventilatory study scores that you had to have in order to qualify for the presumption under Part B under the interim regulation as opposed to a table that looked very much the same except it had different numbers on it that applied under the so-called permanent regulations the Department of Labor had to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.991" offset="3180543">And it was very clear that that particular difference made a significant difference simply turning on the day on which you applied as to whether you qualified or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.991" offset="3600592">You're telling us that Congress was very concerned that you use medical criteria in your sense, test criteria, that are no more strict than what HEW had been using.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.064" offset="3648866">But so long as you do that you can import all other sorts of qualifications that will reduce the number of successful claimants, including if you haven't been a coal miner for ten years, you don't get the benefit of the presumption at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.991" offset="3708530">I suppose you could have said 20 years or 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.843" offset="3715949">That's a weird intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.312" offset="3729846">You have to be no more strict on the medical criteria, but as for everything else, you can tighten it up as much as you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.484" offset="3758580">Why would they have that kind of an intent?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="904.468" offset="3766522">--Well, I think what has to be kept in mind is that the Department of Labor was operating in the face of what were indeed competing signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.090" offset="3796928">And one of the ways they tried to deal with that problem was to go back to Congress and present to the leadership in the legislature what it was they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.112" offset="3833082">The presented one set of regulations which were found to be quite inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.314" offset="3845829">They presented another set which were found to be by and large acceptable, including this provision which no one challenged at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.170" offset="3877281">The one thing that I think needs to be gotten cut is that somehow we have to read the statute in a way that allows the existence of additional rebuttal criteria under the DOL regulation which do exist which I think clearly are appropriate and which all parties here agree are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.083" offset="3960977">And somehow it has to be found that the statute's prohibition against more restrictive criteria doesn't bar that.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.689" offset="3995354">I think it's a difficult thing to do, and the most sensible way to do it is to go back to the compromise that was entered into, where on the one hand they wanted to come a good deal closer to what HEW was doing under the interim regulation while at the same time not mirroring the results which they reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.686" offset="4087410">I would like to just address briefly, if I could, the second issue which the Court will have to reach should it decide that in fact the merits issue was properly decided against the position of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.112" offset="4137043">And that is essentially the question of whether parties, claimants who have had their claims finally decided against them can come in in 1985, where the date for filing claims closed in 1980, and all of them had had exercised whatever opportunity they wanted to and had available to seek review of their claim denials, to come in with a mandamus action in order to direct that the claims be reopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.180" offset="4249369">The main point I want to make with regard to that is that that is simply not a reasonable reading of the statutory provision with which we're dealing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.487" offset="4290538">Section 945(b)of Title 30 U.S.C. says that the Secretary is to review each claim... that is, each claim which is pending or has previously been decided at the time these amendments go into effect...</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.413" offset="4354277">"taking into account the 1977 amendments. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.115" offset="4369114">The Department of Labor did this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.317" offset="4377891">The Department of Labor adopted these interim regulations, which were not an easy thing to enact, but they adopted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.821" offset="4407880">They considered these cases under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.959" offset="4420419">They reopened many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.125" offset="4425121">There's nothing in 945(b) that suggests that these cases were to essentially be reopened for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.480" offset="4458558">And that any time anyone should come in at whatever year in the future and raise a question about the interim regulation, that these people could come back and their claims would spring back into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.122" offset="4505056">It's contrary to the notion of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.824" offset="4519893">It has frightening practical implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.692" offset="4527416">Twenty-eight hundred cases alone in the Eighth Circuit, and that's a tiny fraction of the total in the country, would have to be reopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.096" offset="4553016">And furthermore, mandamus is not the avenue to pursue such relief even if the statute were to properly read as is indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.052" offset="4592827">Mandamus is a remedy available where there is essentially a clear and indisputable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.606" offset="4615083">I think it's fair to say that neither the right claimed under 945 nor the right claimed on the merits issue is what you describe as clear and indisputable, and on that basis, we would urge strongly that in any event, the relief given to the seven claimants is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.401" offset="4682270">I would like to save the remaining time if I may for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.138" offset="4705154">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, for the U.S. coal and insurance industries, the two central questions that are presented here are matters of fundamental fairness and economic stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.731" offset="4763563">The Secretary of Labor in drafting his own version of the interim presumption could not replicate the Social Security Administration rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.984" offset="4796582">The validity of the Secretary's action in this regard in drafting his own interim presumption presents obviously complex questions of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.608" offset="4835034">But we think that those questions become far less difficult it the language to be interpreted is reviewed and analyzed with an appreciation for the special dynamics of the six-year long process that ultimately produced the Department of Labor rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.785" offset="4895743">From the very beginning in 1969, the Social Security Administration program was a distinct and different phenomenon from that that was entrusted to the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.558" offset="4938897">It was different intent and it was different in its design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.342" offset="4949973">If the Social Security program had this monolithic purpose to simply pay as many claims as it possibly could, that was not the intent that Congress had for the Department of Labor program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.769" offset="5003681">No one expected that this same one dimensional approach would be adequate at a time when the coal industry was called upon rather than the federal general revenues to pay the benefits that were to be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.445" offset="5066375">The Labor Department's program is a workers' compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.183" offset="5085392">It is financed by employees, and employers have the right to litigate cases and to contest non-meritorious claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.419" offset="5114336">Employers also have a right to have rules and regulations under which these cases are to be adjudicated that are fair and valid both from a statutory point of view and from the point of view of what their contents provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.012" offset="5168670">The Department of Labor's 10 year rule and its rebuttal provisions, which still remain in this case and it was decided I think in the Fourth Circuit's decision below, should be sustained by this Court unless they were prohibited or irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.189" offset="5225408">It cannot be argued that the Department of Labor's presumption is irrational or in any way unfair to claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.712" offset="5259472">That is an argument that cannot be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.528" offset="5266682">The presumption that the Secretary of Labor wrote is probably the most plaintiff-favorable rule that has ever been written by a federal agency, and has delivered billions of dollars in benefits to hundreds of thousands of claimants, many of whom do not have Black Lung Disease or any disability that's related to Black Lung Disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.625" offset="5347139">And this is well documented by successor reports of the Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.410" offset="5362290">This is a program, the Department of Labor program, which has never been criticized by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.647" offset="5387158">Congress from 1969, 1970 through 1972, through 1978 strongly criticized the programs of the Social Security Administration as being too restrictive, and criticized the programs of the Department of Labor as being too restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.038" offset="5440762">That has never happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.240" offset="5445568">This presumption that the Labor Department wrote, and particularly, we will focus on its 10 year provision, should be analyzed in the sense that it was not unreasonable for the Secretary of Labor to limit access to this extraordinarily powerful presumption, where the undisputed scientific evidence that was presented to the Congress demonstrated that short-term coal miners are quite unlikely to contract Black Lung Disease, and that even if they did contract Black Lung Disease, the likelihood of it manifesting in a disabling stage is almost nill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.567" offset="5614842">It simply doesn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.250" offset="5621634">There is no scientific evidence to support that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.202" offset="5637411">It was not unreasonable for the Secretary of Labor to begin from that premise and to apply a 10 year screening provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.327" offset="5673878">Of course, this does not as the Solicitor General pointed cut, prohibit these people from getting benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.813" offset="5699896">Any one of them who can come forward with direct proof of totally disabling pneumoconiosis under criteria, which in a report to Congress in 1983 prepared for the Department of Labor at the request of Congress demonstrated we're still extraordinarily liberal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.516" offset="6630691">The word "criteria" in the statute, criteria for total disability, it does not say criteria for causation of disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.920" offset="6660262">These are words that by their very nature call out for some interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.573" offset="6678861">We also have a setting here where the Secretary of Labor was directed to write his own regulations and to consider all relevant evidence in writing those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.345" offset="6718045">We have a situation in which the Secretary of Labor was directed to also apply the statutory presumptions which require ten years of coal mine employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.368" offset="6750123">This forms... these various directions form a package which the Secretary of Labor put together in a regulation which is still extraordinarily fair to claimants, extraordinarily fair to claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.925" offset="6804354">And we think there is certainly sufficient ambiguity in the specific statements that Congress made, and clearly there is from this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.781" offset="6843746">I think it's undeniable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.983" offset="6848553">That the Secretary of Labor had flexibility in designing a rule which would meet with Congressional expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.654" offset="6879273">But even perhaps more importantly here, this rule, the rule that the Secretary of Labor wrote, was subject to a de facto veto, not by Congress, but by the three people with the most, a proprietary interest in this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.563" offset="6934861">Three members of the conference committee, the officers of the substantive committee in which the statute was designed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.377" offset="7126078">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.233" offset="7157529">Our position in this case is essentially two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.685" offset="7171322">First, we believe that the Labor interim presumption regulation is clearly in conflict with the governing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.272" offset="7197653">Under the 1977 amendments, it is our position that the Secretary was required to make available the interim presumption of disability to all Black Lung claimants who filed prior to a certain date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.348" offset="7246032">The Secretary's rule however as has been discussed flatly bars any claimant from invoking the interim presumption if he does not have ten years of mine employment in his background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.621" offset="7287096">For this reason it was fully appropriate in our view for the Fourth Circuit in Broyles to have granted relief to two claimants who had individually pursued their claims through more than a decade of administrative appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.595" offset="7330982">And the second, we believe that the Eighth Circuit in Sebben was also correct in granting mandamus relief to the affected class of claimants who were denied the interim presumption and did not pursue these individual appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.153" offset="7385212">Our argument here is primarily based on a separate section of the statute which specifically directed the Secretary to review the files of all pending and denied claims, applying the revised statutory standards, and to grant immediate retroactive benefits to any claimant who under those revised standards would have already demonstrated entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.983" offset="7464520">These reviews, however, were conducted without applying the revised statutory standards where there was less than ten years of mine employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.904" offset="7492210">Mr. Smith, do you contend that if the Secretary did follow what you say was the statutory mandate and did review a claim under the guidelines, do you agree that that becomes final?</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.730" offset="7543514">If the administrative review isn't pursued, that that's not everlastingly open?</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.766" offset="7563681">Mr. Chief Justice, it the reviews had been conducted under the appropriate standards, and at that point the claimant had been notified that there had been a determination made that they didn't qualify, at that point I would certainly concede that their only appropriate relief would be an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.358" offset="7622091">But whereas here the reviews were meaningless in that they applied the same standards that Congress had just thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.512" offset="7642675">Our contention is that the will of Congress certainly requires that they be allowed the opportunity to enforce this right and have a meaningful first level review as Congress mandated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.447" offset="7770362">The same standards which had led to this less than 10 percent approval rate were being applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.018" offset="7788647">The statute was passed for the precise purpose of throwing cut those standards, but when you had a claimant with less than 10 years, they didn't have any revised standards applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.040" offset="7824801">Indeed, if they had been denied previously, when they were reviewed, they were reviewed under precisely the same standards that they had previously applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2074.706" offset="8447456">--The line we draw, Justice Scalia, is based precisely on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.741" offset="8459576">There's a separate section of the statute, section 923(b) which says in every adjudication make sure that all relevant medical evidence is considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.781" offset="8495730">Now, in 1977 in the revised statute, they incorporate that provision into the definition of total disability which is what we're talking about here, 902(f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.787" offset="8535749">And the conference report specifically says apply the SSA, the HEW criteria except be sure you follow this other statutory requirement which is to make sure that all relevant medical evidence is considered in each adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.047" offset="8592801">There was concern that SSA had not been allowing all of the relevant medical evidence to come in on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.700" offset="8615371">And they drew specific attention to this other statutory requirement which they had incorporated into the Secretary's duties in that bill and said make sure that you follow all the SSA criteria except make sure that all the relevant medical evidence can come into the process at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.245" offset="8681617">And then when the Secretary promulgates the broader rebuttal criteria under the revised rule, the Secretary specifically based those broader rebuttal criteria on this other statutory section and on the conference report's reference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.136" offset="8733131">So what you have here is you have a general requirement, equivalent disability criteria from the SSA rule and the Labor rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.040" offset="8760820">A specific exception to that general requirement pointed out by Congress and then pointed out by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.277" offset="8785689">That exception doesn't in any way suggest that the general requirement is itself in any way soft or loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.514" offset="8810662">It is a specific exception which doesn't support their position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.049" offset="8828843">Certainly, they can't say that by excluding people with less than ten years they've facilitated the consideration of all relevant medical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.886" offset="8852145">So in the end I think the fact that Congress crew a specific exception supports our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.802" offset="11339838">And that was the, under standards that had a less than 10 percent approval rate before the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.789" offset="11363766">Now, as Justice Scalia pointed out, you can't separate out causation from disability here and say they had complete discretion to tinker around with the causation criteria at the same time that they were supposed to promulgate equivalent disability criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.429" offset="11418309">Under the Social Security interim presumption regulation, which Congress incorporated, causation was part and parcel of the disability determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.202" offset="11453418">It was one of the elements you proved in order to get the presumption of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.439" offset="11470345">So the Secretary's position amounts to the proposition that the Secretary was required to give everybody a presumption of disability and at the same time retain the discretion to prevent some people from attempting to prove one of the two elements which led to that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.747" offset="11519560">Sort of giving with the right hand and taking away with the left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.449" offset="11530427">And then just a final point on the validity of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.602" offset="11554982">When you actually look at what they say about what the Secretary was really thinking, they abandoned their own theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.590" offset="11582985">They don't talk about causation of the disease at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.725" offset="11595524">They say, well, the Secretary thought there was less likelihood they would have severely disabling levels of pneumoconiosis if they had less than 10 years in the mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.581" offset="11626976">And whatever's clear, if they were trying to screen out people because they were less likely to be disabled, that's a disability criterion, not a causation criterion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.920" offset="11664278">And on that issue, Congress had spoken, said, give people the presumption of disability because we, we, we have incorporated the SSA approach, and we're not going to allow the Secretary then to just come in and say, well, I just think it's, I disagree with Congress, I think these people are less likely to be disabled and I'm going to not give them exactly the benefit that Congress wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.267" offset="11749647">Again just a final, a second final point on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.821" offset="11767932">The notion that Congress in some way ratified this when they sent over this pile of regulations and they didn't notice this problem is, is ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.325" offset="11801891">There's no indication whatever in the letter that Congress, these three Congressman had any awareness at all that the two interim presumption regulations were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.664" offset="11831253">Indeed, Mr. Solomons, in previous briefs, has asserted that nobody in Congress was aware of it and nobody in the Department was even aware of it until 1981 when it was raised in the Benefits Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.270" offset="11873676">Now, assuming that the court determines that the regulation did violate the statute, that these people were supposed to get an interim presumption of disability, the next question is the scope of relief available to the class in Sebben, those who did not pursue their administrative appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.564" offset="11938878">Now, our position as I explained a little bit at the outset is that exhaustion is not required here because of Section 945, which was a special mechanism created by Congress which mandated an absolute right to an autocratic reassessment--</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.741" offset="13351580">Just a moment on this mandamus point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.610" offset="13367044">We do rely on a different jurisdictional theory than under City of New and Eldridge, but that's simply a result of differences between the Social Security Act and the Black Lung Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.299" offset="13405810">Under the Social Security Act, you can go to the District Court from any final order of the Secretary, and in City of New York this court determined that there was such a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.571" offset="13438933">Here you have, the only jurisdictional grant in the statute is under the Longshoreman's Act, which says you can go to a court of appeals from a final order of the Benefits Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.212" offset="13477490">And if you're going to enforce a collateral right directly in court, you obviously can't go to the Benefits Review Board and get a final order first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.116" offset="13501105">So we had to go to a non-statutory jurisdictional approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.235" offset="13517509">The approach that was selected was 1361 jurisdiction rather than the usual 1331 jurisdiction and APA review, because the Federal Coal Mine statute has a section that says the APA doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.309" offset="13569859">And there was then some question of whether 1331 was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.696" offset="13583443">We do think a mandamus is the appropriate statute here, if these other routes were not available, because it exists exactly to provide a fallback in situations where Federal officers are disobeying the law and there's no other method to enforce the law against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.039" offset="13644778">And certainly I think the proposition that if we have shown the regulation to be invalid that somehow we haven't shown it clear enough, asks it to be cut too thinly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.979" offset="13684484">You have... if we can overcome the usual deference to administrative discretion here and have shown a flat inconsistency between the regulation and the statute, that's certainly enough for mandamus as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.952" offset="13728474">Just one more point on the City of New York case, because I think it is an important case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.440" offset="13750417">The government and the private petitioners attempt to distinguish this case from City of New York on the theory that there you had a secret policy which was not known to people at the time they could have filed their administrative appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.514" offset="13802662">The fact of the matter is, though, that the whole last section of that opinion dealt with people who did have time to file their administrative appeals at a time when the secret policy being applied in the Social Security Administration was publicly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.858" offset="13860027">And the court held that even as to those people where you have a right to a valid first-level disability assessment, and it's clear that administrative review would be futile and that there be massive abandonment of claims if we require it, that the court would, allowed direct enforcement of the collateral right in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.171" offset="13937349">Our case is such easier, because you have this special provision in the statute, 945, that said, reopen these things under the 1977 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.158" offset="13969219">That case is really one where you, which is much like the one hypothesized by Justice Scalia, one where they simply were told to apply the law in the adjudications and they weren't doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.181" offset="14005372">If there are no further questions--</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3472.687" offset="14039331">Thank you, Your honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.739" offset="14043616">I would just like to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.955" offset="14048422">One is that the 1977 amendments did indeed do some significant things to help miners with less than 10 years of experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.075" offset="14076948">It expanded the definition of pneumoconiosis, it put a prohibition on rereading x-rays to disqualify people, it made clear that a worker's compensation concept of causation that allowed only partial causation to be enough was sufficient, and it gave a right to a full pulmonary exam in order to generate the evidence you needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.056" offset="14152807">The other point I'd like too make is that this, these interim regulations rest on a solid foundation in the legislative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.893" offset="14184154">The conference committee made clear in the report that the conferees also intended all standards are to incorporate presumptions contained in another section of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.219" offset="14233474">The presumptions include the presumption of causation from 10 years of coal mine experience, which this provision in these interim regulations essentially is identical with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.841" offset="14276001">Secondly, the scientific data which was appended to a number of reports throughout and to the final House report includes information that indicates that 10 years is sort of the presumptive beginning for serious black lung problems.</text>
