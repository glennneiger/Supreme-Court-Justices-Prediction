            <text syncTime="14.916" offset="197998">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.929" offset="226001">This case is here in certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.676" offset="245018">Petitioners are the State of Missouri and its officials found liable in their official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.674" offset="268946">We present two issues involving the attorney's field ward arising out of the Kansas City, Mo., desegregation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.375" offset="299771">The first is an 11th Amendment immunity issue, this time as it pertains to a Section 1988 fee award that includes prejudgment interest or compensation for delay in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.369" offset="347732">The second issue concerns an issue that was also involved in the Blanchard v. Bergeron case, and that concerns the proper method of compensation for paralegal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.115" offset="390781">I would like to briefly address the 11th Amendment issue first, and while the underlying facts in this case have been complex, only a few facts are relevant now.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.534" offset="428398">The Kansas City desegregation case began in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.017" offset="446370">The fee award, however, went to two groups of attorneys who entered the case later.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.719" offset="465178">Kansas City attorney Arthur Benson and his staff entered the case in 1979 and was awarded $1.7 million in fees and expenses for the period through June of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.634" offset="516796">The NAACP Legal Defense Fund entered the case in 1982 and were awarded $2.4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.023" offset="546367">The plaintiffs became prevailing parties in September of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.459" offset="568101">The fee applications were filed in February of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.596" offset="584714">The fee awards were based on current rather than historical hourly rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.829" offset="605612">This was expressly done to compensate for delay in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.187" offset="623062">Out of approximately 18,000 attorney hours compensated, about 85 % were incurred in the years 1983 and 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.543" offset="660470">The record shows that the current hourly rates used were approximately $15 to $20 higher than the historical rates for this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.695" offset="697041">Now, the 11th Amendment and the current status of the 11th Amendment is involved in at least two other cases before this Court this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.692" offset="729015">Pennsylvania v. Union Gas argued last October and Gilhool v. Muth scheduled to be argued next week.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.626" offset="760780">The issue was also touched on briefly in Wheel v. Michigan State Department of State Police argued in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.077" offset="790559">The 11th Amendment has been explored in great detail in previous recent opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.057" offset="818458">I'm not sure that I can add much to the detailed historical argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.352" offset="839670">In this case, it is the State's position that compensation for delay in payment or prejudgment interest is barred by the 11th Amendment, and we submit that the principles set forth in this Court's Library of Congress v. Shaw decision can be extended to an 11th Amendment context.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.315" offset="907588">Now, Library of Congress dealt with the fee-shifting provision of Title VII and the federal government's sovereign immunity In the long-standing no-interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.966" offset="946145">Sovereign immunity was expressly waived concerning attorneys' fees and costs, but this Court found that it was not waived concerning the sovereign's immunity from interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.853" offset="985746">We believe it can be extended to the 11th Amendment context because of the numerous similarities between the fee-shifting provision of Title VII and Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.318" offset="1027542">First, Section 1988, when enacted by Congress, Congress specifically relied on the language of Title VII, the fee-shifting provision of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.611" offset="1064741">The identical relevant phrase is found in both fee-shifting provisions, that is,</text>
            <text syncTime="238.342" offset="1091699">"a reasonable attorney's fee as part of costs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="241.825" offset="1105596">In analyzing these words, this Court has already determined that they do not include prejudgment interest or compensation for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.979" offset="1138197">More Importantly, the standard for finding a Congressional abrogation of the 11th Amendment immunity is just as strict, if not more so, as the standard for finding a Congressional waiver of the United States sovereign immunity.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="265.269" offset="1199323">But one of your problems, it seems to me, is to show that this no-interest rule attaches to state sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.954" offset="1234118">You don't get to whether there's a clear statement or something like that until you find that that's an incident of the state sovereign immunity, it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.184" offset="1267033">And we believe It can be extended to the 11th Amendment because of the character of the element we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.822" offset="1289603">Prejudgment interest, or compensation for delay, or whatever term is used to describe the time value of money, is traditionally an element of damages, not cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.318" offset="1343519">And the 11th Amendment immunity is protective of the state's liability from elements of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.611" offset="1372776">And that's, the character of prejudgment interest is one of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.500" offset="1388241">We do not believe it's relevant that the Missouri has a general stare statute that has been Interpreted by stare courts to allow prejudgment interest against the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.899" offset="1457831">Couldn't one argue that what's at stake here is that there's no sovereign immunity that's been decided for the liability for fees themselves, and the question is just how one measures the fee that's due, given the delay in payment?</text>
            <text syncTime="342.410" offset="1507882">There's no separately calculated item of prejudgment, it's just somehow, it's mixed up in the Judge's calculation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.798" offset="4489498">The district Court also included fees for recent law graduates who are not yet admitted to the bar who also worked on the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.715" offset="4565149">They're not attorneys, they can't receive attorneys' fees, so therefore the fee comes under the paralegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.337" offset="4587614">Courts also routinely reduce hours or eliminate the hours if paralegals are doing clerical work that should be considered normal office overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.799" offset="4641426">We also take the position that fee litigation may actually be reduced, because the dollars at stake are less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.407" offset="4671937">And that thereby reduces the incentive to litigate the fees, particularly when everything you do in fee litigation just generates more fees for the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.715" offset="4717181">Now, we concede that Congress was concerned about providing for reasonable attorneys' fees, but there was also a concern in Congress that Section 1988 not result in windfall to attorneys or become a relief fund for lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.519" offset="4784368">Compensating paralegals at a market-based rate does result in a windfall, particularly in this case, where the paralegals were hired specifically to work on this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2668.434" offset="10811967">And Judge Clark said that he was looking at the delay-in-payment factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.792" offset="10837462">I said before... if I may interrupt myself, Justice Scalia... I said before that he treated Arthur Benson differently from the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.243" offset="10863271">He, what he did with Mr. Benson was to say that, on the basis of skill and experience in the Kansas City current practices, Mr. Benson's current hourly rate ought to be $175, but that he was going to give him an enhancement to $200 an hour because of three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.874" offset="10953759">One was the fact that Mr. Benson was precluded during this representation from representing anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.871" offset="10981763">He couldn't accept any other clients for a period of two and a half years or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.493" offset="11004228">In effect, he bet his professional life on this case and, as the record reveals, he went into debt to the extent of 600 and some-odd thousand dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.772" offset="11041322">So, all right, Judge Clark thought that that was a factor appropriate to be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.535" offset="11064414">The next was the unpopularity of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.830" offset="11081550">And Judge Clark thought, referred to newspaper editorials and newspaper stories and letters to the press and letters to the court denouncing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.480" offset="11132228">Mr. Benson became a pariah and Judge Clark thought that that was a factor that might be taken account of in setting a fair rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.367" offset="11175800">And, finally, he thought that the delay in payment should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.100" offset="11190638">He didn't allocate anything for each of these factors particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.129" offset="11218850">He just said, taking everything together, he thought $200 was an appropriate fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.299" offset="11239434">I don't see that as any award of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.296" offset="11259496">If you split the $25, which is 14 % enhancement, three ways to account for the three factors, that would be about 5 % for a delay of several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.226" offset="11331176">I've never seen an interest table that gave you less than 1 % in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.287" offset="11347477">On the subject of being a pariah and proper compensation for that factor, let me call to the Court's attention something that, to me, as a veteran of some class actions, strikes me as significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.045" offset="11422501">This was a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.107" offset="11434726">There were class action plaintiffs available by the, probably, hundreds of thousands, every black school kid in Kansas City was a potential plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.289" offset="11475477">The extraordinary thing about this litigation is that not one lawyer in Kansas City or anybody else stepped forward to join in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.677" offset="11512989">If it had been an antitrust case, or if it had been a, if the Hyatt Hotel had collapsed, if whatever, a Securities Act case, there would have been hoards of lawyers coming in, saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.453" offset="11556143">"I want a piece of the pie. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.015" offset="11562308">Nobody joined Arthur Benson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.405" offset="11571921">He remained alone until the Legal Defense Fund came to join him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.747" offset="11589266">I think that, too, is worthy of consideration, and so did Judge Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.027" offset="11614344">Now, I think that's about, really, all I have to say, or need to say on the question of the way Judge Clark treated this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.068" offset="11654572">Taking everything into account, he thought $200 was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.628" offset="11672754">I don't see any reason why the 11th Amendment stands in the way of that kind of setting of a reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.062" offset="11722491">It seems to me totally responsive to the statutory command.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.326" offset="11739627">Now, I think that it might be appropriate to mention that the use of current rates in billing, in the experience of all of us, conforms to the practice of the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.798" offset="11869508">I have never seen, I don't think any member of this Court has ever seen a bill which read something like,</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.184" offset="11903049">"for services performed in 1987, at 1987 rates, dollars X; for services performed in 1988, at 1988 rates, dollars Y; and for services performed in 1989, at 1989 rates, dollars whatever. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.332" offset="11975565">I might kick myself for having waited so long to render a bill, but I think that the uniform practice of the bar, when it renders bills, is to bill them out at current rates.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay Topkis</label>
            <text syncTime="2987.072" offset="12086533">I would think, in that case, yes, your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.961" offset="12094161">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.289" offset="12099490">Now, one final observation on that point, and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.751" offset="12153302">As I've said, while this date... record contains no data specific to Kansas City, it is clear that in the midwest, generally, market rates in the period with which we are concerned did not keep pace with inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.059" offset="12210563">Our expert on rates, Mr. Well, testified to that effect without contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.384" offset="12243790">And I said that the circumstances of this case make it particularly appropriate to recognize the delay in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.598" offset="12284646">Mr. Benson went into personal debt to the extent of $633,000 to fund this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.500" offset="12320277">And he paid $113,000 in interest by December 31, 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.607" offset="12344727">And he was continuing to pay interest at the rate of $5,000 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.059" offset="12358520">For the Legal Defense Fund, the case was a near disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.465" offset="12380150">We... I'm proud to be a member of the board of the organization... we experienced deficits which we had never experienced before in 1983 and 1984 because of the burden of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.629" offset="12440754">Now, the State says, of course, that we should be happy with historical rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.140" offset="12474817">But, as I've mentioned, the state put in no evidence of historical rates, so we don't know whether to be happy or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.201" offset="12503134">And I may say that, so far as the record reveals, that 1987 current market rates, which Judge Clark used, were the same as or higher than rates in '83 or '84.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.609" offset="13120669">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.039" offset="13120564">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.836" offset="13120460">There's no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.445" offset="13120355">Now, what the State would apparently like is for this court to remand so that we could have a trial on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.394" offset="13120251">Well, the State had its chance, I respectfully suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.815" offset="13120146">This Court has said, and so many of the lower courts have echoed, that we musn't allow these fee controversies to become second Jarndyce against Jarndyce litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.246" offset="13120042">That's the very real danger with which we deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.401" offset="13119937">And so I say, on the 11th Amendment, we wind up like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.147" offset="13119833">There was no award here of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.272" offset="13119728">There was no dollar or percentage award or adjustment for delay in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.505" offset="13119624">There was only a recognition by the trial judge that there had been great delay in payment, and an attempt to deal with that by using current rather than historical rates to award reasonable fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.764" offset="13119519">Now, let me, oh, I don't think I need trouble the Court with a review of the legal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.275" offset="13119415">Your Honors are doubtless infinitely more familiar with them than I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.554" offset="13119310">Just a final word or two on the question of paralegals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.738" offset="13119206">I, oh, no, if I may stay with the 11th Amendment for just a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.814" offset="13119101">This Court has often said that the reason for requiring unmistakably clear language, when the Congress sets out to abrogate 11th Amendment protection, is so that enormous fiscal burdens... and I quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.698" offset="13118997">"shall not be imposed on the states by the Congress without careful thought. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.992" offset="13118892">That's reasonable enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.039" offset="13118788">But we have here no enormous fiscal burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.865" offset="13118683">As I've seen, we don't know the historical rate that the State will employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.974" offset="13118579">But the total fee award here for services was only around $3.2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.548" offset="13118474">So use of historical figures would save the State, what, hundreds of thousands of dollars?</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.616" offset="13364757">In the District Court's opinion, on page A-28 of the petition, of the appendix to the petition for cert, the Court says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.423" offset="13399970">"the Court notes that the $80 per hour rate is approximately $15 to $20 higher than the average hourly rate for Kansas City associates in 1982 to 1984. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.768" offset="13541345">Mr. Farmer, could I ask you about where you draw the line with respect to the principle you're talking about, that the 11th Amendment requires us to interpret statutes strictly against state liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.935" offset="13597978">I mean, I can understand that where the question is, are states covered by this statute or are they not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.448" offset="13628071">But once you know that the state is covered, every single issue of law that comes up in the interpretation of that statute we have to, we have to interpret in favor of the state unless Congress has made its intent unalterably clear?</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.395" offset="13683869">So, for example, we should interpret attorneys' fees not to cover fees for counselors at law in those states where they are not called attorneys?</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.289" offset="13803405">In that case, Title VII waived the federal government's sovereign immunity for attorneys' fees and costs, but not for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.083" offset="13830572">And, similarly, in this case, while Section 1988 waives 11th Amendment Immunity for attorneys' fees and costs, but also not interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.908" offset="13869965">And Hutto v. Finney applies Section 1988 to the states, but even Hutto recognizes that if you expand the traditional concept of costs, then that analysis would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.279" offset="13915418">I'm not sure there's any easy answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.325" offset="13931614">It's a difficult analysis, but I think in this case the principles in Shaw are completely applicable to the 11th Amendment context.</text>
