            <text syncTime="9.856" offset="180801">Mr. Merrill?</text>

          <turn speaker="thomas_w_merrill" startTime="17.176" stopTime="246.624">
            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="17.176" offset="210058">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.128" offset="229911">This case concerns the constitutionality of a system of fees established by Congress in Section 7005 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.519" offset="279439">The District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, adopting the report of a magistrate, held that the statute is an unconstitutional delegation of Congress' power of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.409" offset="323011">The case is here on a direct appeal from that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.111" offset="333774">The Appellee does not argue in its brief that Section 7005 violates the general non-delegation principles articulated... articulated by this Court in its decisions beginning with J. W. Hampton and Company v. United States and most recently in Mistretta v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.990" offset="409320">Instead, Appellee argues that... that the case does not come within the terms of the ordinary delegation doctrine for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.013" offset="445369">First, Appellee contends that the power of taxation is subject to a special and highly restrictive version of the non-delegation principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.320" offset="482672">And second, Appellee contends that the fees that were imposed by Section 7005 cannot be sustained as an exercise of any power of Congress except its power of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.728" offset="536275">I'd like to turn to those two arguments in a moment, but first I think it would be useful to spend a little time looking at the... the provisions of the statute that is at issue here, Section 7005, because when we do that, I think you'll see that Congress has, in fact, given the executive very little discretion in this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.743" offset="624360">In fact, Congress itself made most of the crucial policy decisions implicated by this particular system of fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.349" offset="662708">Congress provided in the statute quite clearly that it was to apply to only one agency, the Department of Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.253" offset="686322">This is not an omnibus bill that applies to... across the board to all Federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.538" offset="703459">Congress articulated quite clearly its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.323" offset="714639">It wanted a system of fees established that would recover the costs that the Department of Transportation incurs in implementing two pipeline safety programs, the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.500" offset="767406">Subsection D of Section 7005 imposes a precise ceiling on the total amount of fees that can be collected in any given year.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.938" offset="805127">It cannot exceed 105 percent of the annual appropriations established by Congress for both of these pipeline programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.759" offset="832399">In Subsection C of the statute, Congress adopts another limitation providing that the fees can be used only for one purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.948" offset="865104">They can only be used to support the agency's activities under these two pipeline programs and not for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.602" offset="887779">Subsection A(3) and Subsection D of the Act both specify exactly who is to pay these fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.423" offset="915050">They are to be paid by all natural gas pipeline transmission companies and by all liquid... hazardous liquid pipeline companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.879" offset="952876">And finally, the only area of the statute that really provides for any degree of discretion at all is the section that sets forth how the fees are to be established, and that's Subsection A(1) of Section 7005.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.205" offset="1010136">And if we look at that section carefully, you will see that Congress, in fact, adopted no less than four constraints on the exercise of discretion by the Department of Transportation in setting the fee schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.465" offset="1071263">First of all, if the statute is read carefully, you will see that it adopts a single principle that the Department of Transportation is to follow in establishing fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.439" offset="1111073">Fees are to be based on pipeline usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.557" offset="1119537">Secondly--</text>

            <text syncTime="251.461" offset="1147227">I guess one of the things argued by the other side is that it's a tax not a fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.932" offset="1177111">And I must say there is language in National Cable Television and other cases that would indicate that fees are imposed on identifiable beneficiaries for particular benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.910" offset="1240954">And this looks very much like a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.712" offset="1252239">I guess your argument doesn't require us to determine that it's a fee and not a tax, but--</text>

            <text syncTime="288.451" offset="1295184">--As I mentioned very briefly, the Appellees really have to sustain two propositions in order to win here, and if they don't sustain on... sustain both propositions, they lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.490" offset="1331338">The first is that Congress is subject to some special restriction on delegation under the taxing power, and the second is that this system of fees could only be justified as an exercise of the taxing power and not as an exercise of the commerce power.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.000" offset="1385359">Well, you refer... you continue to refer to it as a system of fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.202" offset="1398211">But traditionally fees have been imposed on people who get some benefit from... the user fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.625" offset="1431857">You get something out of it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="328.794" offset="1456517">That's true, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.163" offset="1462055">Recall, however, the Constitution doesn't use the word "fees" and we're talking about an issue of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.900" offset="1488908">The issue of... the second issue of constitutional law presented we think is whether or not Congress had to be acting under the taxing power or whether it could be acting some... under some other power such as the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.142" offset="1537914">Now, it's true that the word "fee" traditionally has a connotation of something like a user fee or some exaction in return for a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.064" offset="1569575">That's what the independent Offices Appropriations Act is about, and that's what this Court had before it in the National Cable Television case and in the New England Power case.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.152" offset="1601966">But if you think about the Commerce Clause and what Congress can do under the Commerce Clause, I don't think it be... can be contended that the only thing Congress can enact is a fee in that technical sense of... of some charge imposed in return for a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.394" offset="1650972">Congress passes statutes containing civil penalties, criminal fines.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.202" offset="1706143">I mean, if it's enacting a tax, why doesn't it proceed under the power to levy taxes?</text>

            <text syncTime="395.606" offset="1723801">The truth is I think, Justice Rehnquist, that Congress doesn't specify what clause of the Constitution it's proceeding under when it adopts these sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.943" offset="1753163">And I think one of our points would be that... that this Court should not force Congress to do that and should not force courts to do that by articulating a different delegation standard that would apply depending on which power Congress is, in fact, operating under.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.186" offset="1806139">That's one of the reasons why we think it doesn't make sense to say that there are two radically different standards of delegation and which one you apply would depend on which power of Congress we determined Congress to be acting under.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.000" offset="2301317">The statute sets forth a single criterion for determining fees: pipeline usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.118" offset="2321797">It's not a multiple choice test in the sense that the Appellees suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.356" offset="2338828">The statute does go on to set forth three factors that the agency can look at in trying to determine pipeline usage, but the ultimate standard that Congress enunciated was pipeline usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.311" offset="2382610">The statute also says that... that in... in determining pipeline usage by those factors that there must be a reasonable relationship between those factors and the determination of pipeline usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.721" offset="2440288">And finally, the statute says that in establishing the schedule, the Secretary shall take into account... take into consideration the allocation of departmental resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.160" offset="2469963">So, what we have here really is a... is by modern standards a highly precise statute, one that sets forth a number of constraints on the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation, and sets forth really four limitations on the type of... the schedule of fees that can be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.704" offset="2540180">I don't think that any serious claim could be made that this statute violates the intelligible principles standard of the J. W. Hampton case which this Court has most consistently applied in delegation cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.130" offset="4641888">Now, the two primary reasons I think, first of all, are just simple a practical problem that when you're operating a government the size of the Federal Government, Congress can't make all the policy decisions itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.938" offset="4689117">It has to utilize the executive branch or the... or executive agencies to decide supplementary issues of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.876" offset="4724853">That has been a primary factor that has been cited in this Court in its cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.261" offset="4738437">The second is a definitional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.613" offset="4743766">If you're going to draw the line between somehow fundamental policy issues and non-fundamental policy issues, how can the Court develop a workable standard for differentiating between those two types of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.255" offset="4790368">That's... those sort of considerations have haunted the delegation doctrine in... in the context... in the traditional context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.992" offset="4817326">And I think they would be equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.111" offset="4825790">Appellees say, well, it's different when we're talking about the allocation of the tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.348" offset="4846792">That's somehow special.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.198" offset="4850136">But the allocation of the tax burden is not just simply a function of tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.584" offset="4871661">It's a function of the definition of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.534" offset="4879498">It's the function of what's deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.953" offset="4885140">It's the function of what kind of credits you get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.803" offset="4892559">And the Internal Revenue, for example, has to exercise a lot of discretion in a lot of areas in determining those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.290" offset="4914502">And so, the ultimate allocation of a tax burden is not something that Congress itself can make every... every... every single decision about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.338" offset="5102688">The issue this raises is how much discretion can Congress give to the executive in implementing statutes that it enacts pursuant to its multiple powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.111" offset="5129751">We think in answering that question, how much discretion can you give before you have somehow deemed to have delegated or deemed to have abdicated that the Court... that the only standard we can think of... the only standard that anybody has really suggested is the standard of J. W. Hampton and Schechter Poultry and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.238" offset="5202267">And... and for the Court to somehow suggest that taxation is different would send us down the road of having to consider all sorts of challenges to tax statutes in a variety of contexts based on the need, first of all, to come up with an abstract definition of taxes as opposed to something else and then, secondly, to try and figure out what this new delegation standard actually means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.306" offset="5310623">Appellees have identified nothing in the text of the Constitution that would differentiate the taxing power from the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.627" offset="5339880">They certainly don't suggest that Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, which sets forth the power to lay and collect taxes itself, provides a textual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.399" offset="5370913">They focused almost exclusively on the Origination Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.451" offset="5383139">I think there are three reasons why the Origination Clause cannot plausibly be cited as a source for some kind of hyper delegation standard that applies only to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.992" offset="5425352">First of all, the Origination Clause doesn't say anything more about the degree of precision that Congress has to use in passing tax statutes than does Article I, Section 8, the Taxing Clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.448" offset="5471119">Secondly, insofar as the Origination Clause can be read as reflecting a policy judgment by the Framers that issues of taxation should remain closer to the people than other types of decisions, the Framers provided a procedural mechanism for realizing that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.059" offset="5541545">They said that tax bills had to originate in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.011" offset="5549382">This bill did originate in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.713" offset="5556174">There's no dispute about that, and so the procedural mechanism that Congress adopted to vindicate its policy has been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.200" offset="5582192">Finally, appellees have quoted to the Court the first half of the Origination Clause which says that</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.640" offset="5615942">"all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.342" offset="5626704">but they haven't quoted or relied on the second half of the Origination Clause which says</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.877" offset="5644886">"but the senate may propose or concur. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.079" offset="5653663">in "amendments as on other bills".</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.846" offset="5660768">So, unlike the British tradition, for example, where the House of Commons got to initiate revenue measures and the House of Lords could only approve or disapprove, vote up or down on that, the Framers rejected that and gave the Senate the power to amend or propose alternative measures even though the bills are originated by the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.027" offset="5749480">This is a much more diluted principle of popular accountability than one would have under the British system or that one would have if all you had was the first half of the Origination Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.085" offset="5793679">And we don't understand how you get from that diluted principle of accountability, how you make the logical leap from that to the proposition that Congress can give the executive no discretion in implementing the tax laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.746" offset="10264379">The Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.532" offset="10379527">Without reaching the issue of taxation, the context of taxation here, I think we can begin with the proposition that whenever this Court has sustained the delegation of law making to an agency, it has always been a predicate for that ruling, that there was something to execute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.179" offset="10466045">There was some program to implement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.047" offset="10477539">There were case-by-case determinations over time in response to changing conditions or whatever.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="3207.135" offset="12969934">Two quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.320" offset="12974636">First, with respect to the argument that the DOT regulations violate the Origination Clause in this case because the regulations didn't originate in the House of Representatives, that argument would call into question the validity of every single regulation issued by the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.996" offset="13041300">And it's simply not the case that all Treasury regulations are interpretive regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.483" offset="13059272">One of them, which is cited in Appellee's brief at page 19, Section... under Section 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code, specifically provides authority to the Secretary to adopt legislative regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.125" offset="13113816">And it's not true that that's some kind of esoteric housekeeping provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.529" offset="13127504">It has to do with establishing standards for allocating income and expenses among affiliated corporations when they file a consolidated return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.182" offset="13162090">And those regulations and the decisions made under them have an extremely major impact on the allocation of the tax burden among affiliated corporations, how much income tax they pay and what kind of capital gains they're subject to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.608" offset="13215798">And with respect to Justice Scalia's question about the President's imposing a fee on imported oil, yes, under the Trade Expansion Act in the early 1970s, the decision was made by President Ford to substitute for a system of oil import quotas a system of oil import fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.004" offset="13289359">And this Court unanimously sustained that against a non-delegation challenge in the case of FEA v. Algonquio which is at 5426 of the United States Reports.</text>
