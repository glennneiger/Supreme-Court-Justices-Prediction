            <text syncTime="603.120" offset="2547047">Subsequent to that confession, as a matter of fact, that very day, he took the police officers back to the scene of the crime, assisted them in finding the weapons, and identified the evidence then.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.810" offset="2585813">That Miranda itself, while there is some discussion in the brief from Respondent that it is improper, clearly it has been approved by both the Seventh Circuit and the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.201" offset="2627296">The issue that was remanded by the Seventh Circuit was whether or not there was any taint to the second Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.355" offset="2655926">This issue, as I indicated earlier, only arises if this Court finds against the State of Indiana on the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.759" offset="2681526">However, we clearly think that this Court's holding in Oregon v. Elstad disavows the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine that arises in Fourth Amendment cases to this Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.233" offset="2727501">Clearly, the next day there was no indication in the record that we had intimidated Mr. Eagan, had in any way forced his testimony, that his statement was anything but voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.291" offset="2775671">It is argued that clearly Mr. Eagan had the right... had been properly warned of his rights and had voluntarily waived them to make that confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.830" offset="2813810">We see no need for the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.949" offset="2822378">We would urge the Court to... if it reaches that second issue, to find that remand is simply inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.037" offset="2854665">I would reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.964" offset="2910358">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="696.447" offset="2920285">The United States, the State of Indiana, and Respondent, all agree that under this Court's decision in Miranda against Arizona that police must inform a suspect who is in custody of his right to consult with a lawyer before any questioning begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.140" offset="2975142">The question presented here is not whether a suspect must be so warned but rather what form that warning may take.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.128" offset="2999070">More precisely, whether advising the suspect that he has the right to the advise and presence of counsel before any questioning, but also that a lawyer will be appointed if and when he goes to court to comply with the requirements of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.768" offset="3049643">In our view, such warnings, taken as a whole, do adequately inform an indigent suspect of his right to consult with a lawyer before any questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.124" offset="3083080">Here the initial set of warnings given to Respondent conveyed all the rights required by the Miranda decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.111" offset="3107008">The Hammond detectives told Respondent that he had the right to remain silent, that he had the right to the advise and to consult with a lawyer, that he had the right to have a lawyer present during any questioning, and that he had this right to the advise and presence of a lawyer even if he could not afford to hire one.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.989" offset="3170538">The court of appeals concluded, however, that providing respondent with the additional piece of information that a lawyer would be appointed it and when he goes to court rendered the warnings inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.512" offset="3208572">The court of appeals is found two reasons for that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.047" offset="3218708">First, according to the court of appeals, that, statement suggested that only those persons who could afford a lawyer had the right to have a lawyer present before any questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.451" offset="3252354">And, second, that challenged statement suggested that indigent suspects are not entitled to a lawyer at all either before or during questioning if charges were not filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.426" offset="3292269">In our view, the court of appeals was mistaken on both grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.211" offset="3307420">The challenged statement simply explained the mechanics of appointing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.615" offset="3324974">The previous two warnings... that Respondent had the right to speak with a lawyer before any questioning, that he had the right to the presence of that lawyer during questioning, and that he had this right to the advise and presence of counsel even if he could not afford to hire a lawyer... made clear that whether respondent could afford to hire a lawyer or not, he had the right not to be questioned until a lawyer... until he had the chance to talk with a lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.893" offset="7638104">The record suggest that the reason they did that... the officer who testified at the suppression hearing said,</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.225" offset="7727443">My submission is that they use it in order to obtain statements that violate Miranda or where they view a Miranda as not being applicable, and particularly after this Court's decision in California v. Prysock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.652" offset="7789091">In California v. Prysock, the suspect was informed of his right to counsel and then told that the court would have to appoint a lawyer for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.341" offset="7827857">And this... the majority of the courts said that was fine because it did not link the appointment of counsel to some future event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.482" offset="7864429">He could have had the court appoint the lawyer at that time and place at the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.118" offset="7886998">And if you look at how courts have construed the Prysock decision, it is that the first set of warnings given Eagan were invalid because they linked the appointment of counsel to some future event.</text>

            <text syncTime="2015.883" offset="8198065">And the rights established my Miranda include the right to counsel at the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.321" offset="8219798">In my brief I cite a recent decision of the Illinois Supreme Court, Justice Kennedy, which comes close to the facts you've suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.025" offset="8246652">There the suspect was informed of his right to counsel and he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.429" offset="8264207">"Do you mean I can have a lawyer here at the interrogation? "</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.131" offset="8279044">And the police said to him,</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.131" offset="8283015">"Yes, we can call the public defender, but it will take a little while. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.749" offset="8297539">That was found acceptable and I think that is perfectly... a perfectly appropriate result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.170" offset="8319168">The question you have asked comes closer than the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.355" offset="8331916">Saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.889" offset="8334110">"Well, you can't get one until you go to court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.842" offset="8345918">Had they said you can't get one until we call the public defender, that, the Illinois court said was all right, and I submit that there is the distinction between the weight that is always going to be required to obtain counsel and conditioning the right to counsel on a future event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.435" offset="8412269">And that is the line this Court drew in Prysock, and that is my submission as to where the Court should appropriately draw the line here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.623" offset="8449049">Turning briefly to the second admonition, again, this was given the next day by the same police department after the police had interrogated the complaining witness, the victim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.800" offset="8501712">Again, the warnings did not comply with the traditional Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.085" offset="8518848">But they were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.985" offset="8522505">The same police department gave different warnings the day after the "if and when warnings".</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.756" offset="8545598">These told him that he had the right to a counsel of his choosing at the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.893" offset="8566078">And then they told him later that if he was indigent, counsel could be appointed to represent him at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.016" offset="8602649">The Seventh Circuit remanded this case for a determination as to whether the second set of warnings saved the second and that incriminating statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.807" offset="8641728">And I submit to you that that is the appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.509" offset="8656566">As I've noted in my brief, the transcript of the suppression hearing was not produced until after the oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.579" offset="8680807">It was never made part of the record on appeal in either... in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.298" offset="8699720">And when one looks at the explicit four corners of the second set of warnings, it is clear that these, too, reasonably can be read to have conditioned his ability to have counsel at the time of the interrogation on his ability to retain a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.243" offset="8767534">And, in any event, looking at the first and second sets together, coming as they do one day apart, it is my submission that again he was never given information regarding the clear right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.718" offset="8813405">And this takes the case out of Oregon v. Elstad where there was a complete and accurate Miranda warning given prior to the second admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.708" offset="8861366">It is our submission in this case, your Honors, that the Seventh Circuit granted very modest relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.612" offset="8884980">That is, to suppress the exculpatory statement and to remand the case to the district court for a determination of the admissibility of the incriminating statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.903" offset="8930120">I believe that we have shown that the Miranda decision requires the provision of counsel at the time of the interrogation, that the warnings given to Eagan prior to the first interrogation did not give him the right, did not inform him of that right, and, therefore, his waiver was not knowing, not intelligent, and the statement was properly suppressed by the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.483" offset="9016429">We ask that the judgment of that court be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.852" offset="9025937">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.024" offset="9062613">Just briefly, the State of Indiana does not ask for a major revision of Miranda in this case when it's not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.247" offset="9095527">In our view, the warnings we provided, as we have previously discussed, clearly apprised Mr. Eagan of nothing but the truth in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.503" offset="9132517">Indeed, as the court is aware, Miranda itself has indicated that if the state can't provide a lawyer on the spot, then the only thing that is prohibited is continued questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.227" offset="9183403">To the extent we've gotten somewhat afield in regard to the chronology of events, in our view, stated succinctly, Mr. Eagan or any individual who is Mirandized in this way, has control of the interrogation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.289" offset="9251740">If he feels that he does not want to continue a statement that he has begun, or he doesn't want to answer any questions in the first instance, all he need do to terminate that interview is to simply say, "I want a lawyer".</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.218" offset="9431358">If, for example, a standard... a standard Miranda were given to an individual who was cognizant, had some ability to think at the time, one of normal intelligence as, "Do you understand this"?</text>

            <text syncTime="2350.033" offset="9534698">We think that these kinds of questions probably arise on a fairly regular basis in regard to Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.622" offset="9565000">In other words, if you indicate to the gentleman or the person who is being interviewed, "Do you have questions"?</text>
