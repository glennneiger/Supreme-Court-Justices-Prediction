            <text syncTime="944.283" offset="3918147">And what did Congress do?</text>
            <text syncTime="945.876" offset="3924521">Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 just six weeks ago, and in that... and in that legislation, which I pointed out in the supplemental brief, the Court again... excuse me... Congress once again said we're staying with the teachings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.215" offset="3985857">States cannot tax except in the article 3 gaming area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.593" offset="4271323">That was when the Indians were dying, and the allotments had taken the millions of acres of reservations in the West and put them into allotments and seeing those allotments... because every time an Indian received an allotment, he didn't pay his property taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.633" offset="4343525">But in 1934 it all changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.118" offset="4349481">Now, we think we have a stronger case than... than Bracker, getting back to Bracker, simply because our regulations control the activity being taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.504" offset="4395039">And in Bracker, this Court found that there was a chilling effect on the timber industry even in the face of a minor $34,000 tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.968" offset="4428893">There were three findings in Bracker by the Court: one, that the federal statutory scheme designed to maximize profits from timber was being interfered with; two, that the tribe and future contractors were simply were in a less attractive economic environment and therefore there would be a chilling effect on, on timber activity; and three, the state tax also deprived the tribe and its business partner of money, expense money, if you will, to comply with a comprehensive scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.379" offset="4554490">Now, in our brief, we have gone on with, you know, pages of federal regulations, and the Jicarilla brief also has several pages of tribal ordinances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.444" offset="4674758">We focused for a minute on the traditional view, the traditional context of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.146" offset="4693566">I just want to remind the Court that in Crow Tribe v. Montana, the Court in a summary affirmance saw that Act as being preemptive and struck down off-reservation taxes in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.985" offset="4740900">We're talking about on-reservation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.750" offset="4751976">And this Court also in Kerr-McGee v. Navajo Nation described that statute as a comprehensive statute and recognized that it was critical to many rural reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.045" offset="5405141">Both times the Court said the act of severance of minerals is a local act, and we are going to allocate under the Commerce Clause to the local government the power to tax that local act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.928" offset="5472746">Well, and I think that's fair to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.459" offset="5482882">In Merrion, on one hand, the Court said we're going to allocate this, and you... and you did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.161" offset="5497615">We're going to allocate this to the tribe, but then the Court dropped a footnote 26 saying, well, if... if you've got problems with multiple taxation, go after the state, and that's what we have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.142" offset="5533559">So, our view is that the preferred result is an allocation of that power to the tribe where you have trust resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.796" offset="5560204">If you've got fee oil and gas within a reservation, for example, we would think some allocation might be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.840" offset="5584341">We've... we've also offered the idea of a credit perhaps as a way of recognizing the primary power of the tribe and yet providing the state with some tax revenues in those limited situations where there is a specific state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.178" offset="5645677">So, allocation and apportionment are both available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.333" offset="5658320">We think in this case allocation is the proper way of resolving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.004" offset="5673053">And the Court could consider the idea of a credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.378" offset="5686532">It had rejected the credit in the Colville case, properly so because the Court pointed out in Colville that the only Indian commerce you had there was an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.468" offset="5718820">You're bringing a cigarette tax exemption on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.623" offset="5731463">A credit wouldn't preserve that exemption, and therefore it was rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.178" offset="5809726">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.174" offset="5849746">This is a case dealing with whether New Mexico can tax oil companies within its boundaries because those oil companies obtain their income by the purchase from Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.870" offset="5904498">It is not a case about whether the tribes can tax the oil companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.056" offset="5925187">This Court decided that in 1982 when 21 of the oil companies doing business on this same reservation sued the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.584" offset="5959355">And this Court has determined that they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.475" offset="5966879">And New Mexico has no quarrel with that, and New Mexico had no quarrel with that back in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.503" offset="5987045">It's also not a case about whether the federal government, I take it, can impose its taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.689" offset="6011705">We talk about multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.626" offset="6019541">The federal income tax on Cotton as far as the income it receives and the windfall profits tax is just as much multiple taxation by another concentric sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.153" offset="6061651">The two taxes which we deal with here today... and Cotton has waived its claim to three, as I understand their brief... are first the oil and gas emergency school tax which was originally enacted in 1935, and the oil and gas severance tax was a... which is a tax on the severance and the sale of oil and gas, which was enacted in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.284" offset="6162170">Both of these taxes were recodified in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.563" offset="6179202">Now, before these taxes are imposed upon the oil company, they are allowed to deduct the royalties they pay the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.388" offset="6214519">So, absolutely no economic impact, whether it's incidental or otherwise, falls upon the tribe in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.026" offset="6245135">The royalties are deducted and they don't bear the brunt of any of the taxes, nor do the oil companies have to pay those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.960" offset="6272825">Additionally, there is no agreement in this case, as there were in the other cases beginning with the White Mountain case, the Central Machinery case and the Ramah case, to refund this tax to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.985" offset="6332906">This tax refund would go right back to the oil company and any future savings, if the Court struck the tax down, would go to the oil company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.718" offset="6495910">However, if it's income of a non-Indian citizen, then that tax is imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.914" offset="7096622">The 1938 Act had a repealer clause in it which only repealed acts that were inconsistent with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.771" offset="7124103">There's a long history leading up to the passage of the 1938 Act which began back with the 1927 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.378" offset="7150539">Prior to 1927, there was a great debate in this country between the attorney general, the Indian tribes and the federal government as to whether or who owned the property under executive order reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.514" offset="7203097">In 1922, this Court held in Gillespie v. Oklahoma that states could not tax lessees' interests on Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.775" offset="7244057">Also, around that same time, at that time Attorney General Stone issued an opinion that said these executive order lands could not be leased under the 1920 Land Mineral Leasings Act leased federal land because the way executive order reservations were set up was that the President would set out a parcel of land for a group of Indians that did not have one and allow them to stay there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.157" offset="7333605">Then in 1927, after much debate, consternation by the states, three things were decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.121" offset="7361504">Number one, the Indians receive their land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.824" offset="7372266">And the 1927 Act specifically says that they get their executive order land unless Congress says otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.524" offset="7399120">There was a debate about whether the states should have a royalty under lands or whether they should be able to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.460" offset="7422839">The states argued that the land should be leased under the 1920 Act in which case they would receive 37 and a half percent royalty just like they did under the federal leases at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.269" offset="7466098">The Indian tribes didn't believe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.238" offset="7473935">And finally, in 1927 Congress struck a compromise which allowed the Indians to have their lands and royalties, but allowed the states to go ahead and impose their taxes just like they would on any other lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.622" offset="7523463">Now, in 1938 the Congress passed the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.870" offset="7548436">The Act did nothing to change oil and gas leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.369" offset="7562438">It had absolutely nothing to do with any changes in that area, but primarily dealt with changes in the area of metalliferous minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.068" offset="7589292">There is no... there were no committee hearings at that time regarding the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.443" offset="7606741">There was no record, quite frankly, except for a letter from the Acting Secretary of Interior to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.863" offset="7640492">And the reasons that Act was passed was, number one, to make sure that the Indians had the authority to consent to the mineral leasing, to allow oil... or not oil companies, but to allow mining companies when they came on to the leases to follow the one, which they could not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.278" offset="7698066">And it specifically followed the terms of the 1927 Act as far as oil and gas leasing is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.603" offset="7727427">And the repealer clause indicated specifically that it only repealed acts that were inconsistent with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.992" offset="7756998">And the taxing power of the states was not inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.834" offset="7768283">One final point on the history of that Act was that just two months prior to that Act, this Court decided the case of Mountain States... or excuse me... of Mountain Producers v. Helvering in which case the Court struck down the governmental immunity doctrine and reversed the case of Gillespie v. Oklahoma which meant at that time the case this Court felt that Indian tribes... or lessees on Indian tribe's reservations could, in fact, be taxed under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.339" offset="7878310">We think it was highly unlikely that two months later the Court by its silence... and we think this Court has held that you do not imply immunity by silence... that this Court would have repealed somehow by implication the provisions of the 1927 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2308.426" offset="9374709">--Your Honor, I suppose that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.536" offset="9383172">I can't deny that you obviously want to make as high as a profit as you could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.940" offset="9400727">However, that works with states as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.578" offset="9411280">You would certainly rather do business in a state that had, had a lower tax rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.217" offset="9425909">If you were doing... if you were operating in the State of Utah or some other state that had county taxes, you'd want to do business in a county that had lower taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.699" offset="9459763">However, in this particular case, the record is clear and the district court found below that the profits are sufficient that the state taxes are insufficient... or excuse me... are insignificant as far as production is concerned and that they really make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.178" offset="9525697">As a matter of fact, as evidence of that, in 1977 there were 1,353 producing wells on the Jicarilla reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.908" offset="9560596">In 1985 there was 2,224 wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.499" offset="9582957">Cotton in its testimony by Mr. Wood, their division production manager from Denver, indicated, notwithstanding the economic conditions nor the tax, they were going to continue to drill, were drilling 12 new wells in the year following the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.322" offset="9638337">So, there was no evidence in the record and the court found, that these taxes in no way hindered any economic development, production and certainly not the ability of the tribe to raise its funds as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.833" offset="9696328">I'd like to talk a little bit about that because I think that it's important to note that the tribe is not affected even though I believe Congress has spoken, that the tribe is absolutely not affected by this particular tax and, as a matter of fact, they're doing pretty well with their tax as they should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.654" offset="9767590">They enacted a five percent tax upon... up on top of their one percent severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.900" offset="9800609">When they did that, they have realized a rather significant amount of money, and they're continuing to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.913" offset="9824642">They have built up a permanent fund of $50 million that the tribe now owns, and that is higher per capita, per Jicarilla, than is the New Mexico permanent fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.831" offset="9868319">They have no tribal taxes on the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.406" offset="9878663">They have a tax-free environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.016" offset="9885037">In fact, they pay each Jicarilla member out of their royalties and out of their taxes each year $4,000 to $5,000 to supplement their income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.933" offset="9920772">So, I think that's further evidence that this particular tax has no impact on the ability of the Jicarillas to develop their own resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.056" offset="9953269">I want to talk just a little bit about the disagreement between us and the plaintiff or Cotton Petroleum as far as the benefits that New Mexico confers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.644" offset="10011574">There have been a couple of statements in this Court's cases that indicate that the states have no more responsibilities as far as Indian tribes are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.530" offset="10047101">The record indicates here that the Jicarillas spend 85 percent of their money off the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.900" offset="12068560">We said that when you have a Commerce Clause inquiry, you look at the controlling acts of Congress, Congress to see if there are any... if you see... to see if there are any, and then you look to the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.521" offset="12107117">We said the preemption concept was a background here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.066" offset="12121223">So, we didn't... we didn't say it wasn't a preemption case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.347" offset="12134389">We said the preemption issues were a part and parcel of the Commerce Clause issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.174" offset="12153719">Now, I would like to rebut several, several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.484" offset="12170960">First of all, the Indian tribes... some of them are doing better today than they have been, and it's partly because of congressional support and because of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.434" offset="12210771">The Jicarillas have more oil and gas reserves than most reservations, but let's... let's not... let's not New Mexico overstate the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.211" offset="12241804">The record here indicates in transcript 514 that the average per... per capita income of these Indians is less than the per capita income of New Mexico citizens, let alone the per capita income of the rest of the citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.752" offset="12303976">And I think that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.237" offset="12309932">The second point is, yes, New Mexico is the provider of a civilized society off the reservation, and the record indicates that the Indians here, Cotton, its employees, its contractors, when they're off the reservation, they pay all of those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.012" offset="12364998">And the Court has indicated in Ramah that... that off-reservation benefits and services simply don't answer the question about what happens on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.929" offset="12408674">And we think the record here indicates there is a deterrence of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.427" offset="12426751">The tribe has indicated there's a chilling effect on terms of now it may develop resources in... in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.675" offset="12451724">And Justice O'Connor I think makes it apparently clear that if you have a 14 percent of value tax burden on the reservation, inevitably that's less attractive than off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.733" offset="12499894">So, in Bracker, in Ramah, in Mescalero, in Cabazon, these are cases where much smaller intrusions, much smaller levels of taxes were kept off the reservation than here, and we would... we would say that those teachings suggest that when you have significant taxes here that aren't justified, that they should be kept off the reservation too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.145" offset="12593621">The tribes are developing more significant governmental services.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.055" offset="12713262">But from the point of view of the tribe trying to develop a stronger economic base for its members, it doesn't matter whether it, it draws revenues from a nonrenewable trust resource from royalties, rents or from taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.664" offset="12891626">Now, the final thing I'd like to say about the effort to revisit Blackfeet... and it's a little troublesome to the Court because the 1924 and 1927 Acts... they authorized taxation of the Indian share as well as the, the producer share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.378" offset="12954529">So, it the Court were to reverse itself in Blackfeet, then it seems to me it's stuck with a... a rather anomalous situation of saying in this most important area of all for Indian economies, Congress has spoken and taxation can apply to... across the board, to Indian tribes as well as producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.634" offset="13043554">And so, we would urge the Court not to go backwards, not to upset what we think has been a consistent 25-year line of cases ever since Warren Trading Post that says taxes are a burden on Indian commerce, and they can only be justified by a specific showing of state responsibility and state services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.267" offset="13122026">And that's what Congress now agrees to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.063" offset="13133207">As I said, in the Mineral Leasing Act, in the Gaming Act, they support the Court's findings.</text>
