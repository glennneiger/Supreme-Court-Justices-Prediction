            <text syncTime="25.331" offset="247229">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="30.185" offset="266664">This case involves a State tax on the act or privilege of engaging in interstate phone calls, a form of interstate commerce that by its very nature occurs in more than one State at once, simultaneously, that introduces into two States at once substantial economic activities and involves the delivery of services in two States at once, and in fact can become the subject of a tax in at least two States at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.539" offset="388081">Nevertheless, in this case, Illinois has levied a tax on the whole of all interstate phone calls that originate or terminate in Illinois and that are charged to an Illinois service address.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.731" offset="452865">The question these circumstances raise, we believe, is whether or not this violates the interstate Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.087" offset="482226">And in our view it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.439" offset="491630">In fact, it violates all three of the elements of this Court's Complete Auto decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="512006">And what I--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="92.510" stopTime="131.051">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="92.510" offset="515976">Why... why is it you say that they levy it on the whole of the... of the service?</text>
            <text syncTime="98.497" offset="539905">The initial obstacle I confront is I don't see how this is different from any sales tax, let's say, on a piece of tangible goods that... that is manufactured in a number of other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.339" offset="595284">The raw materials come from... from Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.706" offset="604793">The manufacturing is done is Ohio, and whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.808" offset="617122">Yet, the whole value that has been added to that item that's sold is taxed by the State that imposes a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.231" offset="646902">Why can't you say that... that that also taxes activities in other States?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_a_smith_jr" startTime="131.051" stopTime="216.472">
            <label>Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="131.051" offset="670099">--No, Your Honor, because the State courts have held already that the tax is, in fact, levied on the entirety of the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.372" offset="699460">It is true that the taxable event is the origination or the receipt, but both lower courts have construed the statute to levy the tax on the entirety of the phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.862" offset="745331">And unlike a sales tax, which this Court has often reviewed, where it can be isolated in a single taxing jurisdiction, in this particular circumstance, it... the interstate phone call cannot be isolated in a single taxing jurisdiction because economic activity by definition is occurring in two different States at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.510" offset="824012">Moreover, unlike a sales tax situation, here the delivery of goods occurs partly outside the State, and by the definition of its own statute whether or not the call is billed for or paid for in Illinois, Illinois nevertheless taxes the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.387" offset="895483">And the result is we risk multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.923" offset="909589">In our view, the tax violates all three of the Complete Auto requirements for slightly different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.093" offset="938324">But at bottom, there's one reason why all three elements are violated, and that is because this tax reaches outside Illinois' borders to tax the whole of the call as both lower courts found when they rejected the proposition that what was being taxed was only in state in commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.731" offset="2320829">To tack on a credit provision on a wholly unapportioned tax and hope that the States and the participants... interstate commerce will be able to sort it out, there's no guarantee that the sorting out will ever occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.091" offset="2378298">And certainly it will not under this credit provision, and let me explain why that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.145" offset="2394494">In our view there are approximately... in fact, not approximately... there are only three circumstances that could occur under this credit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.216" offset="2426781">One is that no other State will tax the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.584" offset="2440260">Another is that the other State will tax the other end of the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.654" offset="2460531">And the third is that the State will, at the other end of the call, will attempt to tax the Illinois taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.558" offset="2484146">In our view, though, in none of these circumstances will fair apportionment be brought about, and let me explain why that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.545" offset="2508074">If no other State taxes the call, fair apportionment will not be brought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.366" offset="2531376">Illinois will still have taken more than its fair share of the commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.187" offset="2550706">And at the same time, it will have subverted and preempted the choice of the State at the other end of the call not to tax the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.459" offset="2591771">The second possibility is that the State at the other end of the call will tax its own taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.362" offset="2615385">But by the terms of this statute, its credit provision, no credit will be permitted in that circumstance because this credit provision grants a credit only where Illinois' own taxpayer is taxed twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.956" offset="2673795">So, those are the two... two of the circumstances, and in neither of those will fair apportionment be brought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.026" offset="2698037">Now, the third circumstance is where the other State attempts to tax the Illinois taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.716" offset="2724786">But in our view, even in that circumstance, fair apportionment will still not be brought about, and there are two reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.536" offset="2752058">First of all, the credit provision by its own terms grants a credit to the Illinois taxpayer only where the other State taxes the same event that Illinois has already taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.177" offset="2802631">But by the terms of the statute, as construed by the lower court, the event that is taxed is the origination or termination of the call that is charged to an Illinois service address.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.001" offset="2853936">So that if the other state taxes termination where a call is billed or paid, while Illinois has taxed origination where the call is charged, two different events will be taxed and no credit will be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.400" offset="6855477">So, I will pass on from that to the question of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.702" offset="6868747">And I think that the Appellants forget conveniently what the purpose is of requiring apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.375" offset="6907408">The purpose is that when the State taxes an activity that occurs in more than one State, some measure is needed to ensure that the State is taking only its fair share of the pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.968" offset="6957772">And this is required by due process type nexus requirements because if the State taxes something that is occurring in another State, there may be a nexus problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.423" offset="7003643">Now, the classical situations where apportionment has been required are, for example, in the case of a net income tax on the operations of a unitary multistate business or a property tax on movable property, such as railroad cars, which is used in a number of different States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.154" offset="7082533">In those circumstances, the pie that is being taxed... that is, the tax base to which the tax is being applied... is activity occurring in multiple States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.462" offset="7123807">That pie has to be sliced so that the taxing State gets only its fair share, and normally apportionment is the method that is used to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.632" offset="7156407">Now, this tax fully satisfies that objective because the pie that is being sliced here at all interstate calls between a party in Illinois and a party outside Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.208" offset="7210742">And the way Illinois has sliced this pie... and I do not understand my friend's suggestion that the legislature didn't make clear what it was doing because I think Justice Stevens is completely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.064" offset="7250135">The statute does what it does, and what it does is to slice the pie by taxing calls charged to an Illinois number and not taxing calls charged to a non-Illinois number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.889" offset="7297469">Now, I don't know whether you call this apportionment or you don't call it apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.359" offset="7315336">But what you do call it is something that fully satisfies the Commerce Clause purpose of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.779" offset="7341041">So, it seems to me that there is that fundamental fallacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.083" offset="7366223">Now, let me come back to a point that was involved in Justice Scalia's first question because there are sort of two different ways you can look at this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.856" offset="7401331">We argue that, first of all, you can look at it as being like a sales tax on the purchase of an interstate telephone service in Illinois or like a gross receipts tax on the revenues from interstate carriers doing business in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.068" offset="7470190">Now, I am told, of course, that that is not what this tax is because the Illinois court said it's actually a tax on the interstate phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.339" offset="7507284">But this Court has made crystal clear in numerous cases that if the tax is exactly equal in its operation to some other kind of clearly lawful tax... and that's exactly what was involved in Moorman... it will be upheld; that is, you will look at the economic substance of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.151" offset="7578546">Now, what is the economic substance of this tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.087" offset="7590249">The substance is that the Illinois purchaser who purchases a phone call pays a tax of 5 percent of the cost of that purchase charged to his Illinois service address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.228" offset="7634866">It sounds a lot like a sales tax for me... to me, and I think it is quite clear that the fact that it is not technically a sales tax is an effort to throw this Court back to the era of hyper-technical formalism that existed before Complete Auto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.022" offset="7706024">In economic substance it is something that happens... what is being taxed is exactly like a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.860" offset="7733400">It is also exactly like a gross receipts tax; that is, the amount of tax that Illinois collects is exactly the same as if Illinois said we will tax interstate carriers on their gross receipts from interstate phone calls and we will measure that tax by the unapportioned gross receipts that they receive in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.923" offset="7813648">Unapportioned gross receipts taxes have been repeatedly upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.827" offset="7837263">They were upheld in Standard Pressed Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.029" offset="7846040">Moorman said they were good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.231" offset="7854817">Tyler Pipe two years ago said they were good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.797" offset="7865162">I know that in Moorman, Justice Brennan in his dissent questioned the propriety of unapportioned gross receipts taxes, but in Moorman, the unapportioned gross receipts tax presented a problem of Iowa taking too big a share of the pie, which I hope to demonstrate momentarily does not exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.097" offset="7950321">So, I think even if you didn't approve of unapportioned gross receipts taxes on most interstate sales, they're perfectly all right in the telephone context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.285" offset="7987101">Now, the Appellants have argued that a gross receipts tax is different from a tax on the phone call because the incidence of this tax falls on the retail customer rather than on the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.760" offset="8041018">But in economic substance, I think it's generally recognized and I think it's obvious that a gross receipts tax has the same economic effect as a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.032" offset="8078007">It's different in form, but not in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.484" offset="8087829">It has the same economic effect because the cost to the purchaser of purchasing the taxed service will be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.904" offset="8121580">In the case of a gross receipts tax, the tax will not be separately stated, but it will obviously be incorporated in the price of the good or service that is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.094" offset="8154285">Now, even if you view it as a tax on the interstate phone call themselves, which we agree one or more States... other States would have nexus to tax depending on where the other parties, the non-Illinois parties are located... the Illinois scheme fully satisfies apportionment objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.490" offset="8231921">And... and I think I would agree that in the absence of a credit, if Illinois tried to tax 100 percent of all calls to which an Illinois party is a party, there would be a serious problem under the Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.228" offset="8982889">So, you have... and the interstate phone call, after all, consists of calls that could be taxed by either State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.086" offset="9882233">And Commonwealth Edison, if it made one thing clear, was that the relationship didn't have to be to the services but to the in-state activity of the taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.671" offset="10104587">I mean, as we said in our brief I believe, if... if... if there are two cars manufactured in Michigan and brought into Illinois to the same showroom and sold, and one is a Cadillac and one is a Chevrolet, and the Cadillac costs twice as much, the State of Illinois has done exactly the same thing with respect to both of those cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.432" offset="10171669">Yet, it unquestioned that it can tax twice as much for the more expensive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.919" offset="10193612">I don't... I would rather... although if there are more questions about fair relation, I'll be happy to talk about them, but I think the main thrust of the Appellants' argument is in the apportionment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.358" offset="10235408">I think there's a fundamental point about apportionment, and the Court made this point in the Container Corp. case quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.881" offset="10261426">There are two requirements to satisfy yourself that the State is getting a fair share of the total taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.201" offset="10286713">The first is what's known as internal consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.486" offset="10295908">Now, internal consistency is a logical requirement that you determine by looking at the structure of the tax, and what you ask yourself is whether... if this formula were applied by every jurisdiction, would it result in more than all of the interstate transactions being taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.031" offset="10370096">It is crystal clear that the Illinois tax passes internal consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.435" offset="10391620">The only argument I've seen to suggest otherwise is GTE's argument that if other States had different taxes and you put them together with the Illinois tax, there might be a possibility of multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.827" offset="10437282">But, of course, that would make no tax pass internal consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.611" offset="10456404">That is, it totally defeats the purpose of the internal consistency inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.765" offset="10473018">Now, the internal consistency inquiry is very important because it means that the tax looked at on its own terms does not carry with it any inherent risk of multiple taxation of interstate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.304" offset="10515127">Scheiner of course, was totally different in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.406" offset="10527562">Now, there is a second requirement, and that has been called external consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.144" offset="10550549">And what external consistency means... and I'm quoting from Container Corp. where it was called the more difficult requirement... is that</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.750" offset="10580956">"the factor or factors used in the apportionment formula must actually reflect a reasonable sense of how income is generated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.320" offset="10611258">That is, when you look at the way the pie has been sliced, you must ask yourself whether the State has taken a slice that reasonably reflects the in-state component of the interstate activity being taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.429" offset="10663607">But the Court is very hands-off in applying external consistency; that is, the Court has made clear that what you need is a method of allocation or attribution to the State that is... and I quote...</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.928" offset="10973629">Now, but I wanted to make another point about Container Corp. which is overlooked I think by Mr. Smith in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.602" offset="11020336">He... he says, well, we don't... how do we know whether half of the calls are likely to be charged to the Illinois caller and half to the non-Illinois party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.458" offset="11051787">Well, first of all, I think we know that from common sense it's probably generally going to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.779" offset="11072998">But in any event, what is clear is that this factual question... this is a question about whether external consistency is satisfied, not internal consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.301" offset="11111137">And in Container Corp., the Court said unequivocally the Appellant has the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.670" offset="11128587">And there is not one iota of evidence in the record in this case... there's no attempt to prove that the tax doesn't pass internal consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.977" offset="11169860">There is only an attempt to force the Court to take this narrow focus and look only at the calls that are actually taxed, but at the same time not treat it as a sales tax or a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.868" offset="11213433">Now, let me turn to something else because the Scheiner case I think is quite helpful to us in a number of respects, and one of the respects in which it's helpful is that it recognizes that where it is administratively difficult or impossible to tax a transaction appropriately by a non-discriminatory tax, maybe a discriminatory tax would be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.818" offset="11317191">Now, I don't for a minute agree that this is in the least a discriminatory tax, but any scheme of call-by-call apportionment of the kind that the Appellants suggest is either unconstitutional or wholly unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.160" offset="11366615">Now, let me quickly run through the possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.360" offset="11375392">If you're going to apportion an individual call, you can apportion it, it seems to me, either... let's take, first, the possibility that you look on the basis of mileage, which has been suggested in their briefs, and each State gets to tax the share that represents the miles through that State that a straight-line signal between the two points would pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.991" offset="11453864">I think it's clear from MCI's brief and from what anybody knows about the telephone business, that this is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.846" offset="11493361">There is no record of the signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.464" offset="11499735">There is no way to determine which intervening States are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.832" offset="11517289">I question whether an intervening State would have nexus simply because the signal passed through its borders or even touched a microwave relay tower that's within its borders, which the State ought to tax through a property tax it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.074" offset="11566190">But even if you could determine this, it would be a nightmare to administer on a call-by-call basis that kind of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.162" offset="11598582">And I... and I think the Appellants have essentially receded from the suggestion that that should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.364" offset="11615405">Now, there is a second possibility which is that you can impose... and this is the... the only thing that they have alleged they have the technological capacity to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.839" offset="11657305">If I'm in Illinois and I call someone in California, they have suggested that when they send me the bill, they... they have the capacity to tax half of that call... to impose the Illinois tax on half of that call, the California tax on half of that call.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.015" offset="11721985">So, they would... I'm in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.931" offset="11725642">They would bill me for the California tax and the Illinois tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.717" offset="11736822">They have the technological capacity to do that, but I have two observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.252" offset="11754899">First of all, that's unconstitutional unless you're going to overrule National Bellas Hess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.738" offset="11772871">That is, I do not have nexus with California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.357" offset="11783320">California cannot tax me simply because I make a phone call from outside California into California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.194" offset="11814667">Indeed, it can't tax me if I conduct a mail order business with extensive advertising and so on as long as I don't have a physical presence in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.117" offset="11846432">And the second observation is to what end are we going through this exercise when it is essentially going to end up in the State's getting the same amount of tax dollars and the generality of taxpayers paying the same amount of tax dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.310" offset="11907140">And I might mention that neither Mr. Goldberg nor Mr. McTigue has suggested that they have paid a penny more in tax than they would pay under any one of their apportionment schemes except--</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.024" offset="12098043">But beyond that, let's postulate the situation in which a State takes into its head for some reason to tax the party who... who doesn't pay for the call.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.600" offset="12264287">The tax would be zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.383" offset="12267421">If the call was billed in Illinois, the tax would be on 200 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.671" offset="12284662">That would still even out so that the generality of taxpayers would be paying a tax on 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.841" offset="12313292">But people who are in interstate commerce... if I am calling my branch office in California, I have the choice to charge the call in a way that reduces my tax down to zero in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.649" offset="12360522">So, I don't see how the Commerce Clause can be violated when these various schemes actually provide an advantage to interstate callers who... who would want to arrange their affairs to avoid the tax and for the generality a caller would wash out in the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.677" offset="12428649">Now... now, suppose some person came along and said, you know, the only long distance calls I make are to my grandchildren and I charge them all to my phone and the result is that I'm paying more than my fair share of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.902" offset="12477550">I guess I have several observations about that, and I know my time is running out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.770" offset="12493015">So, I... I... I want to remind the Court of something that it said in Moorman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.674" offset="12512659">And maybe this is back on this... on this question of different tax schemes producing multiple burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.495" offset="12535856">In footnote 12 in Moorman, the Court was concerned with whether the Iowa scheme created multiple tax burdens when it was juxtaposed with the Illinois scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.184" offset="12574621">And the Court said the simple answer is that whatever disparity may have existed by these inconsistent statutes is not attributable to the Iowa statute which treats both local and foreign concerns with even hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.110" offset="12626344">The disparity can only be the consequence of the combined effect of the Iowa and Illinois statutes, and Iowa is not responsible for the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.764" offset="12656959">Thus, appellant's discrimination claim is simply a way of describing the potential consequences of the use of different formulas by two States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.953" offset="12689769">Now, what could be more apt to the situation that is being postulated here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.274" offset="12707010">Now, let me come back to the person who says I only call my grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.226" offset="12718817">First of all, it's not clear that at the joints... the play at the joints doesn't just subject him to the tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.164" offset="12754553">You don't declare a statute unconstitutional for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.033" offset="12766047">Secondly, there's no showing that anybody has ever paid actual multiple taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.085" offset="12782242">And with respect to the possibility that potentially such a person would pay tax on more than 100 percent of the calls to his grandchildren, there is the credit provision available if that should happen, if he should be so foolish as to arrange his calls in a way that he does get double-taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.697" offset="12848698">So, I think the risk of multiple tax burdens is a sham in this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.201" offset="12882762">Let... let me close with... with an example on the discrimination point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.373" offset="12907421">Maybe this point is already clear, but I'm thinking about the case... I thought of... if you had two toll bridges, one between Manhattan and Brooklyn and one between Manhattan and New Jersey, and you charged a dollar when you got on the bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.697" offset="12964682">That was the toll.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.633" offset="12968443">No toll when you got off the bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.499" offset="12975967">The result is that the person traveling between Manhattan and Brooklyn, no matter which direction he went in, would have to pay a $1 toll.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.155" offset="13002507">A person traveling between Manhattan and New Jersey would pay a $1 toll when he's going to New Jersey, but returning from New Jersey, New York would collect no toll.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.143" offset="13034481">Now, if I understand the burden of my opponent's argument, it is that that system is unfair and discriminatory against interstate commerce, that you must apportion the toll that is paid on the trip between New York and New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.801" offset="13093100">You must disregard the fact that the trip in the other direction is not taxed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.771" offset="13108982">Now, this seems to me the height of formalism, and I think the Court should stay far away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.841" offset="13129253">If there are no further questions, I thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3251.662" offset="13152554">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.795" offset="13157152">Our... our primary answer to I think most of what counsel has been saying is that he's trying to litigate a statute other than the one that's before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.053" offset="13202187">The statute that is before this Court has levied a tax on the act or privilege of engaging in an interstate phone call, either the origination or the termination of the phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.861" offset="13253387">That is the tax, and it has been measured by taxing the Illinois taxpayer on the whole of the gross charge for the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.168" offset="13294556">We would submit there is no question but what the other participating State in such an interstate phone call has nexus and constitutional authority also to tax the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.393" offset="13343457">And if Illinois can tax the whole of the call, so too can the State at the other end of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.380" offset="13367490">The only explanation, as we understand counsel, that he gives for justifying this risk of multiple taxation is that there is this apportionment formula that I say to you he has created and the State has not written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.271" offset="13422974">And even if the legislature had written it, there's absolutely no evidence to show that the netting effect that he talks about is going to produce the correct amount of revenues either as a whole and certainly not in the case of individual taxpayers, including the two plaintiffs before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.601" offset="13500296">The other rewriting of the statute that counsel wants to do is to call this a sales-tax because he likes the tests for a sales tax much better than he likes the tests for the particular tax before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.326" offset="13547212">But this Court has made clear in case after case that an unapportioned sales tax is illegitimate only when the particular event being taxed cannot be taxed by any other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.668" offset="13604577">And it is for that reason an unapportioned tax is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.303" offset="13619101">But not only is this not a sales tax as written and as construed by the lower courts, but in substance it is not a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.226" offset="13650866">The delivery of all of the goods here being taxed were not delivered in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.130" offset="13674481">Part of the economic activity by definition... and this underlies our whole argument... occurred outside the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.569" offset="13708231">And Illinois did not attempt to tax the purchase here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.205" offset="13722755">It taxed only calls that were charged to Illinois irrespective of where the particular call was billed or paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.377" offset="13759431">So, neither in form nor in substance is this a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.662" offset="13776567">And the final rewriting of the statute he's interested in is to call this a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.566" offset="13796211">And he has told this Court that you have approved unapportioned gross receipts tax on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.803" offset="13825155">It is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.805" offset="13829126">This Court has always required apportionment of any tax that is laid on the entire volume of interstate commerce that occurs in a particular taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.896" offset="13877505">That is what Illinois has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.912" offset="13885550">There is no apportionment formula being used here like Moorman or any other formula that this Court has approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.466" offset="13911777">And we urge this Court not to rewrite the statute for the legislature, create an apportionment formula the legislature did not choose to use, make assumptions that every taxpayer in Illinois has 50 percent of his calls charged to his service address and 50 percent outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.844" offset="13981263">This Court held in the McCloud case and in the Henneford case both you judge the statutes as they come before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.533" offset="14012087">You adjudicate the constitutionality of the tax that the legislature wrote.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.937" offset="14033717">What's the case that holds that the gross receipts tax must be apportioned?</text>

          <turn speaker="walter_a_smith_jr" startTime="3475.306" stopTime="3515.348">
            <label>Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3475.306" offset="14047196">Moorman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.823" offset="14053256">And the formula used in Moorman was... as the Court knows, it was a sales formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.912" offset="14081573">The sales in state was the numerator and the sales out of state was the denominator, and that's multiplied by the gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.749" offset="14112920">Whenever this Court has reviewed a gross receipts tax on interstate commerce, only part of which occurred in a particular State, apportionment is required because in the absence of apportionment, the State not only taxes commerce outside its borders, which it cannot do, but it also subjects that... the particular event in question to multiple taxation.</text>
