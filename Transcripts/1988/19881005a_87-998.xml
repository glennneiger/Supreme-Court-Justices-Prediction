            <text syncTime="87.356" offset="482448">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the sole issue in this case is the constitutionality of the ordinance enacted by the Appellant, the city of Richmond, to remedy the effects of racial discrimination in its construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.497" offset="535006">That ordinance, the Minority Business Utilization Plan, provided that with respect to construction contracts with the city, at least 30 percent of the dollar amount of the contract must go to minority business enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.006" offset="589027">The ordinance was designed to last five years, and contained an appropriate waiver provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.410" offset="610657">By enacting this ordinance, Richmond was attempting to address one of the most difficult problems confronting our nation and its cities and States.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.747" offset="643989">Identified racial discrimination is a scourge of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.801" offset="660185">Richmond focused on discrimination in the construction industry, and proceeded to try to remedy that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.889" offset="688502">Aware of findings of the Congress regarding discrimination nationwide in the construction industry, and of this Court's decision in Fullilove, upholding Federal legislation remedying that discrimination, Richmond examined its own construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.798" offset="748165">It learned that from 1978 to 1983, two-thirds of one percent of its construction dollars went to minority businesses... this in a city that was 50 percent Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.772" offset="796022">That was not all that Richmond knew--</text>

            <text syncTime="169.510" offset="811068">Is that a correct statement that only two-thirds of one percent went to minority business enterprises?</text>
            <text syncTime="174.795" offset="832175">What about the subcontractors?</text>

            <label>Mr. John Payton</label>
            <text syncTime="176.414" offset="838654">--There is no evidence in the record with regard to how subcontracting was divided up, but as the District Court found, there is no reason at all to expect that the subcontracting would have gone another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.106" offset="901452">In fact, when Congress made its findings with respect to the construction industry, it found that the construction industry is an industry which is a business system which has precluded measurable minority participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.266" offset="958085">And the way that occurred, as the Congress identified it, was by first of all having formidable racial barriers to racial entry and advancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.693" offset="1011793">The barrier to entry has to do with how you get to be a contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.645" offset="1031542">The barrier to advancement has to do with what the Congress found, and what this Court also noted in Fullilove, is the problem of racial discrimination in the relationship between prime construction contractors and their subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.254" offset="1094027">And they found that this business system operates in the following way: that a prime contractor often does business over and over again with the same group of subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.628" offset="1139480">And in one of the items that we cite in our brief, Glover, minority business... minority enterprise in construction, that is a study which noted that often in that relationship, prime construction contractors and their subcontractors, often it's impossible to break in by minority contractors, even when they have the low bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.660" offset="1227669">That's one of the problems that arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.029" offset="1241148">So, there is nothing in the record that says exactly what the racial breakup of subcontracting is, but the evidence with regard to prime contracting is stark and dramatic, and there is no reason, as the trial court found, to expect it to be any different.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.644" offset="1351594">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.763" offset="1360058">The means that Richmond chose to try to remedy the discrimination that it identified was to focus on a remedy that was both modest and narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.987" offset="1404884">And The narrow focus of the remedy was to look at subcontracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.355" offset="1422438">And the reason for that, is that I think that everyone would agree, that it is easier to break into the business as a subcontractor, and break into this, what I would call a closed business system, by doing work with prime contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.483" offset="1490879">And the design of this program was that by doing it that way, by having a remedy that focuses on subcontractors, that will establish relationships between majority prime contractors and minority subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.374" offset="1542497">It will establish some trust, relationships, experiences, and thereby allow an expansion of the list of subs that prime contractors would be doing business with.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.349" offset="1586383">--Mr. Payton, some of the cities concerned seem to be with impediments to minority participation, such as complicated bidding procedures and lack of capital and bonding requirements and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.192" offset="1649703">Is there any indication that the city considered any race-neutral alternatives before enacting a percentage set-aside requirement?</text>

            <text syncTime="390.916" offset="1696619">Well, the city was well aware of other efforts, especially efforts by the United States Congress, to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.855" offset="1732355">The problem that the city was faced with wasn't that there was a group of minority contractors out there who were simply having trouble with bonding requirements or bidding requirements... not to say that those aren't problems, but they are, I think, secondary problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.965" offset="1792854">The problem was that we had a business system that had precluded measurable minority participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.650" offset="1811558">The number two-thirds of one percent is insignificant.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Payton</label>
            <text syncTime="470.015" offset="2013014">The reason the description of minorities that exists in this ordinance is there is that it is the same description of minorities the exists in the Federal program in Fullilove, and in fact, it's the same description of minorities that exists in the Virginia code that defines what a minority business enterprise is.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.996" offset="2088978">I don't think that it really matters that much.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.781" offset="2104130">There's no showing that Aleuts or some of the other groups are present in any significant numbers in Richmond, and there's certainly no claim here that someone lost some contract because of an Aleut getting a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.992" offset="2172988">Let me go back to your first question, though, Justice O'Connor, with regard to what the City Council looked at when it was considering this.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.681" offset="2207679">This is not a problem that is brand new on the stage of racial problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.633" offset="2227532">It's one that has been studied and studied, and there have been a lot of different remedies out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.787" offset="2244146">And I guess it's important to realize that when Congress looked at this, when it enacted the 1977 legislation that was the subject of Fullilove, Congress went through a lot of other remedies that had been designed to try and deal with this problem, including laws that made underlying discrimination unlawful, including executive orders like Executive Order 11246, including executive orders like Executive Order 11246, including special efforts by various departments of the Federal Government to try to assist minority contractors... and in the face of all these things, Richmond also had its own anti-discrimination city code.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.460" offset="2390850">It had experience with these Federal programs, including some Federal programs that set goals that applied to minority contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.650" offset="2419584">In the face of all this, when they looked at this in 1983, the number still is two-thirds of one percent of its construction business.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.554" offset="2447170">So, those other alternatives, which are the ones that are normally set forth, simply weren't working.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.958" offset="2472770">It was faced with a problem that required a different solution.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.858" offset="2580394">Richmond was familiar with how these programs had worked.</text>

            <text syncTime="663.826" offset="2788329">And I think that it's not possible for Congress to come up with remedies that affect various localities in ways that will actually deal with these problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.833" offset="4100303">Because there is a virtual preclusion of minority contractors from the construction industry, it isn't possible to look at that set of numbers and use it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.420" offset="7282644">In effect, it was determined that because of the low percentage of awards to minority firms, the construction industry would be required to remedy the situation by having those contractors who were owned by non-minorities contract 30 percent of their contracts to minority firms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.930" offset="9936685">Certainly the Government would have been entitled to provide aid to former slaves to help them become skilled tradesmen, craftsmen, contractors able to stand on their own in the business world.</text>

            <text syncTime="2465.873" offset="9996453">For the Government to have said to white businessmen who were not former slaveowners that they had to provide the remedy to slavery, I think, raises a very different constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.317" offset="10058206">I'm uncomfortable dealing with this in the abstract, because there are so many variables in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.304" offset="10090180">But I don't think we had any remedies in the post-Civil War period that imposed affirmative duty on non-violators, so that's the distinction we make in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.029" offset="10133125">A second aspect of our position is that this ordinance was not narrowly tailored to achieve a proper remedial objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.871" offset="10192476">We've mentioned the fact that the 30 percent quota was pulled out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.090" offset="10209298">The fact that it's over inclusive and that it grants preferential rights to groups that are not resident in the Richmond area, and which have never been subject to discrimination in the Richmond area, would automatically give rise to a constitutional violation as soon as one of these minority group members exercised its right to preferential treatment under the Richmond ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.640" offset="10311594">It's not enough to dismiss the seriousness of the problem by saying none of these groups have participated yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.996" offset="10344926">Under this law, there's nothing to prevent qualified and competent minority firms from areas of the country which have not experienced discrimination to come into the Richmond area and participate under the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.041" offset="10413158">There's no real supervision of the administration of the ordinance to assure that it achieves a business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.362" offset="10438445">The 30 percent quota requirement has a problem in it, in that it's so high that it can force the award of a much higher proportion of the contract to minority firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.144" offset="10537605">This has a serious impact on non-minority subcontractors who are in the same trades where there are qualified minority firms already participating.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.218" offset="11093805">With regard to the question you raised, Justice Scalia, about isn't there a problem because Croson wasn't allowed to raise their bid at the end, the reason... or maybe Mr. Ryland raised it... the reason Croson wasn't allowed to raise their bid once it got the bid from its minority contractor is, under the city's procurement policies, you out in a bid, and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.064" offset="11185233">And when he asked permission to raise his bid in light of this, it was denied, and he was asked to re-bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.285" offset="11206131">And instead of re-bidding, he filed this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.737" offset="11215953">There's just no issue that raises any constitutional question out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.189" offset="11229746">The District Court, in ruling on this waiver issue... if I can just read what the District Court said at note 20, supplemental appendix 231...</text>

            <text syncTime="2803.124" offset="11345521">With regard to what was actually before the Richmond City Council, and what it was trying to address, it was not societal discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.361" offset="11374464">The City Council was aware of what Congress had found, in the construction industry, and how it had described that industry, and what Congress had tried to do to remedy that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.919" offset="11420649">But it was also aware of what had happened in its own industry, and at the City Council hearing, it heard evidence from various of the construction trace associations, and from that it learned that there were virtually no minority members of any of the construction trade associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.095" offset="11485328">It also heard testimony from a former mayor that there was a widespread discrimination in Richmond's own construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.867" offset="11516466">And that testimony was concurred in by the City Manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.450" offset="11526810">So, what Richmond had was a very full set of findings and understandings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.889" offset="11564531">It said so on its face, and when the issue of its remedial nature came up, it came up before all of the trace association representatives testified, and none of them took issue with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.995" offset="11604969">In the District Court, where there was fully opportunity to litigate this, the issue of whether or not there was sufficient factual predicate of discrimination was not joined by Croson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.636" offset="11655542">There is no rebutting testimony about the factual predicate of discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.623" offset="11675499">With regard to whether or not there should be a different standard of proof, or scrutiny, that attaches to a Governmental body that depends on its racial composition, I guess I can only say it's the same Fourteenth Amendment and I think it's the same standards, and it applies whatever the racial composition of Richmond, whatever the racial composition of Richmond's City Council, whatever the racial composition of--</text>
