            <text syncTime="14.926" offset="196453">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.795" offset="207947">I have about a dozen points to make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.329" offset="222053">The first is that title registration is required by law just as in the case of Parr, payment of taxes was required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.935" offset="260505">And in each case, the use of the mails was convenient but not compulsory.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.903" offset="280358">I think that's a significant parallel to the Parr case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.605" offset="295196">Second, even in the decision of Galloway, the Seventh Circuit case initially establishing that odometer tampering could become mail fraud under these circumstances, the court recognized that it was stretching the limits of the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.317" offset="357994">Judge Crabb, the trial court in this case as in Galloway, didn't in Galloway accept the proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.638" offset="387251">She granted a directed verdict, and the Seventh Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.191" offset="405537">Judge Swygert dissented from that in the Galloway case and Judge Cudahy, who concurred in the judgments, said that it was taking the mail fraud statute to its outer limits, but he accepted the extension because of the judicially hypertrophied reach of the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="85.253" stopTime="90.574">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="85.253" offset="477739">Judge Crabb let the case go to the jury and then granted judgment of acquittal after they returned their verdict.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_l_steinberg" startTime="90.574" stopTime="188.970">
            <label>Mr. Peter L. Steinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="90.574" offset="499055">Yes, in the Galloway case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.407" offset="506369">And then in the present case, in the panel decision in which Judge Swygert participated, although he rejected our argument that this wasn't a proper mail I fraud case, he did indicate that it was the history of judicial expansion of the statute which he felt controlled the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.255" offset="593723">Now, I think in the McNally case, this Court established, according to the general principles of interpretation of criminal statutes, that where you're faced with two possible interpretations, you should choose the less harsh one and also that you shouldn't create constructive crimes... constructive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.836" offset="680031">And in McNally itself, the trial court had dismissed mail fraud charges based on the mailing of tax returns which were, once again, compulsory although... and the ruling in Parr was applied by the trial court in McNally.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.064" offset="748995">The odometer tampering statute, which is on the books, covers my client's conduct precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.134" offset="773236">And in the case of Maze where after the offense in maze, which was credit card fraud, had occurred, Congress subsequently passed a law establishing credit card fraud as a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.109" offset="825168">In footnote 9, the Court in Maze noted that there may or may not have been some significance in that and didn't actually decide whether the existence of a specific federal statute covering the specific conduct meant that the mail fraud statute should or shouldn't also apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.765" offset="967796">--Well, it seems to me that if in a single instance the mailing of the title documents doesn't suffice to make it mail fraud, the multiplication of the instances doesn't change anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.042" offset="1024952">I simply feel that the repetition of odometer tampering doesn't create a mail fraud.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Steinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="236.051" offset="1080959">Well, Justice Kennedy, the core prohibition of the mail fraud statute, as I think was well-analyzed in McNally, is to prohibit mailings which somehow alter the situation to the benefit of the person committing the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.746" offset="1151698">And these odometer... these title registrations didn't in any way induce reliance or forbearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.369" offset="1190255">They didn't lull anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.221" offset="1209586">They... they lulled the... the... the car dealer into... into believing that the titles your client had provided him were good in the past instances, and therefore he could rely on good title in future instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.798" offset="1279907">It... the... the success of the title registration indicated that my client had passed good title.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.202" offset="1305507">It said nothing at all one way or the other about whether he had rolled back the odometers.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.423" offset="1322435">And that's been the point I think at which the government's case breaks down.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.725" offset="1339676">There's nothing about title registration which reassures you the odometer hasn't been tampered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.648" offset="1367365">It's simply title registration is a method of preserving a record of who owned the car so that in the event there is an investigation, you can track down what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.121" offset="1417207">Now, It's true--</text>

            <text syncTime="326.859" offset="1444165">Didn't he have to... he had to sell a car, and in order to sell the later cars, he had to persuade the car dealer that he had passed good title to the earlier ones.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.535" offset="1498918">--Well, the reason that there had to be a title registration mailed was because the state has set up a scheme for title registration in order to preserve a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.009" offset="1544789">My client had to pass good title to the cars, but the only reason the title had to be registered was because of a state requirement which was clearly related to assist in the investigation of this kind of conduct when an investigation is appropriate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Steinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="949.241" offset="3933739">The reason it's prohibited is because that kind of conduct is typically associated with fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.678" offset="3951398">And in this particular case, the indictment... there has been some discussion back and forth in the briefs about whether the indictment did or did not charge odometer tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.098" offset="3985148">I think paragraph 4 makes it clear that my client was charged with having caused to be altered the odometers so that they reflected inaccurate mileage.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.888" offset="4020257">And I think it's quite clear that the indictment did, in fact, list the elements of odometer tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.208" offset="4045543">I'd like to move on to the issue of the lesser included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.660" offset="4063411">In the cases of Keeble and Beck, the analysis that this Court used focused on the prejudicial effect of the evidence which was received upon the fairness of the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.836" offset="4116074">And in the Geiger case, the California case that I cite in my briefs, the ALR note to that case lists a number of states which use a rule more liberal than the strict elements rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.827" offset="4168005">It seems to be a perfectly good rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.679" offset="4179499">In the Keeble case itself, the Court noted in footnote 19 the existence of the Whitaker case, the seconal case on the inherent relationship standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.801" offset="4219937">And It noted the abandonment of mutuality and specifically reserved ruling on the propriety of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.121" offset="4245223">So, I don't think that the Keeble case is authority for saying that Whitaker and the abandonment of mutuality are disapproved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.163" offset="4281377">Now, in this case the jury was out for almost three hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.298" offset="4297886">This is a simple case, and the only thing the jury could have been out considering was is this really mail fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.971" offset="4328606">Are these mailings really sufficiently closely related to what my client was trying to do to be mail fraud?</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.375" offset="4354206">I think it's clear from that record that a lesser instruction on odometer tampering had at least an arguable chance of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.830" offset="4392031">I think it arguably would have changed the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.282" offset="4409899">And the double jeopardy issue raised by the government I think is a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.102" offset="4429125">The Blockburger test for a lesser offense using the elements has been noted by this Court as simply a shorthand method of determining legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.394" offset="4470294">And even if the Blockburger test says that one offense is an included offense of another, if the legislative intent is to impose double punishment, it's proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.202" offset="4517524">As in the Garrett case, as in a case cited in the supplementary brief in... before the court of appeals, Missouri versus Hunter, the armed robbery and armed criminal action can be punished as separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.442" offset="4574471">Both our side and the government's side agreed in the supplemental briefs filed with the court of appeals that the double jeopardy analysis shouldn't be used to determine this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.733" offset="4619715">In the government's supplemental brief at page 10, you'll find that concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.487" offset="4638732">So, I would submit that in fact the only way to preserve fairness in a situation where there is a potential for juries being influenced by proof of one crime is by looking, in fact, at the evidence in order to determine what instruction is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.502" offset="4734758">I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.827" offset="4780002">The first issue in this case is whether there was enough evidence for the jury to find that Petitioner Schmuck used the mails to further his scheme to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.433" offset="4818454">The indictment alleges and defines that scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.868" offset="4828172">It states that from on or about July 1, 1979 until on or about July 30, 1980, defendant Wayne T. Schmuck did devise and intend to devise a scheme to defraud persons in the State of Wisconsin who would be and were induced to purchase automobiles from Wisconsin dealers on which Schmuck had caused the odometer mileage to be altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.215" offset="4917615">The government alleged and proved an ongoing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.769" offset="4931826">The victims of that scheme were the retail purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.571" offset="4946977">They testified at trial that they relied on the false odometer readings when they made their purchase decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.125" offset="4969233">And, indeed, Petitioner's counsel at trial conceded to the jury that their testimony showed that his client had devised a scheme to defraud within the meaning of the mail fraud statute.</text>
