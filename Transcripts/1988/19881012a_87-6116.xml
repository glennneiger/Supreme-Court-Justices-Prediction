            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147952">We'll hear argument now in No. 87-6116, Steven Penson v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.654" offset="178568">Mr. Ayers, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory L. Ayers</label>
            <text syncTime="10.622" offset="190375">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.359" offset="221304">The issue in this case is whether Steven Penson was denied his right to counsel on his direct appeal in the Ohio Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.381" offset="253382">We would submit the facts of this case clearly demonstrate that Mr. Penson's lawyer deserted him with the permission of the Court in a case that presented arguable issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.503" offset="293924">I'd first like to give the Court some of the factual background of the case, and then get into our legal contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.259" offset="324958">Mr. Penson was tried, along with two co-defendants, for a number of criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.847" offset="347319">After he was convicted, all three, because they were indigent, were appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.817" offset="371142">The two co-defendants' appellate lawyers filed briefs on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.971" offset="391831">Mr. Penson's lawyer did not file a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.772" offset="406982">Instead, Mr. Penson's lawyer filed a one statement certificate with the Court stating that there were no errors requiring reversal, modification, or vacation of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.247" offset="460899">He further indicated that he would not file a meritless appeal, and he moved to withdraw as counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.170" offset="488589">A week later, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted his motion without reviewing the record or without requiring a brief from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.209" offset="528713">The Court subsequently refused to appoint counsel for Mr. Penson upon his request, and then, several months later, proceeded to decide the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.166" offset="572599">The Court, in its decision, expressly disagreed with counsel as to whether there were reversible errors in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.105" offset="608334">In fact, the Court found one reversible error, and reversed one of the counts on the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.092" offset="636233">The Court further found that there were several arguable errors as presented in the briefs of the co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.079" offset="664236">But instead of appointing counsel, as we submit the Court was required to do, the Court determined that its own error in not appointing counsel was not prejudicial to Mr. Penson, because it had examined the record and the errors submitted by the co-defendants in their briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.426" offset="741559">Of course, the mere fact that the Court found an error that counsel did not find doesn't show that he was effectively deprived of the assistance of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.360" offset="853363">The Court did give the, the defendant, Mr. Penson, the benefit of one of the issues raised by one of the co-defendants, and that was the count that was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.250" offset="884919">Where the Court denied Mr. Penson his appellate right to counsel in this situation was where the Court found arguable issues that this Court has held in... repeatedly, in a number of cases, that the Court in that situation must appoint counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.556" offset="4634117">Strickland also says that where counsel is denied or is absent or fails to participate in the adversary process, then prejudice must be presumed, because counsel's presence and participation in the adversary process is essential to a reliable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.018" offset="4707991">Here we had no participation by counsel in the adversary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.237" offset="4724814">Strickland says that when counsel is absent or doesn't engage that process, then prejudice has to be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.557" offset="4746130">So I think in... we meet, clearly, a Strickland test, if the Court would choose to apply a Strickland test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.627" offset="4766401">But I think as Justice Marshall has pointed out, that this is clearly an Anders and Douglas violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.764" offset="4790956">The Court does not have to apply an effective assistance test to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.002" offset="4811959">We would submit that the prejudice test applied by the Court of Appeals in this case does not protect the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.362" offset="4877369">This Court held in Pennsylvania v. Finley that the Anders procedures were designed specifically to protect the right to counsel, and that necessarily... it necessarily follows if those procedures are not followed... if counsel may be allowed to withdraw from non-frivolous cases, then the right to counsel becomes illusory, and indigent defendants are not afforded equality with non-indigents on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.697" offset="4990636">That's the fundamental due process violation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.316" offset="5005160">It further invites attorneys to abandon appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.970" offset="5027730">If Courts, or if defense lawyers know that they can be relieved without being required to file an Anders brief and demonstrate to the Court that an appeal is frivolous, then I think it would invite wholesale abandonment of clients and shifting of the burden to the appellate Court to engage in that decision making process without the briefing and the oral argument... the cornerstones of effective appellant decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.089" offset="5148207">There must be an adversary process here, and counsel did not engage that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.393" offset="5173493">That's why it cannot be relied upon as producing a just result in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.130" offset="5192406">We submit that presuming prejudice, if the Court looks at a Strickland test, if it applies to Douglas and Anders decisions, consistently with this case, demonstrates that the violation is easy to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.547" offset="5302120">And it accords fundamental respect for the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.333" offset="5317271">This Court said in Ross v. Moffitt that an indigent must be afforded an adequate opportunity to present his claims to an appellate Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.182" offset="6016621">I think what the issue boils down to is whether or not an indigent defendant in a criminal appeal has an absolute right to have a brief filed on his behalf, regardless of the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.406" offset="6065523">And it's the position of the State of Ohio that he has no such right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.303" offset="10229128">And certainly the difficulty of measuring prejudice in a case like that is much greater than the difficulty of measuring prejudice on an appeal situation like Anders, where regardless of who the attorney is, he's bound by the same record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.944" offset="10283671">It doesn't matter who you appoint... you could appoint 15 different attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.265" offset="10300912">They've all got to examine the same record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.633" offset="10310421">They can't go outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.117" offset="10316376">They can't introduce new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.585" offset="10322228">They've got to pull their issues out of that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.537" offset="10334035">And I think that's... makes prejudice much easier to measure, and I think certainly if the Court does not want to adopt a Strickland type test in a situation like this, certainly harmless error analysis is appropriate in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.361" offset="10385340">There's no good reason why harmless error analysis would not apply in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.265" offset="10404984">Briefly, as far as some of the issues that were raised in the reply brief... and I'll refer to pages 9 through 11 of Petitioner's reply brief... he raised some issues that he says prejudiced Mr. Penson, because they were not raised, and they could have been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.852" offset="10523266">I would note, also, that Mr. Penson had the same attorney that he has now... the same office represented him on his discretionary appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, and basically they were complaining about the job that the Court appointed appellate counsel did in that Court, that they made no effort to raise any of these issues before the Ohio Supreme Court, nor did they make any effort to raise any of these issues at any time until the reply brief was filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.019" offset="10636011">The first thing they refer to is that the trial court erred in convicting and sentencing Penson for both having the weapon under a disability in Count 29 of the indictment and the firearms specification that accompanied that indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.047" offset="10700063">And they claim that that's a violation of Ohio's multiple-count statute, and also a violation of double jeopardy provisions.</text>
