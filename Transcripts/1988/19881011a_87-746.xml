            <text syncTime="11.606" offset="183191">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.756" offset="191760">Before the Court is the case of a natural father whose claim of paternity was precluded by the operation of a California state statute, which had the effect of terminating an existing parent-child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.032" offset="248916">Also before the Court is the natural father's daughter, who is represented by a court-appointed independent guardian ad litem.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.506" offset="286741">Both are here challenging the Constitutionality of that California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.058" offset="308997">With the Court's permission I would like to begin with a synopsis of the pertinent facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.779" offset="331880">In the fall of 1980, Michael was having an intimate relationship with Carole, who was married to Gerald.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.568" offset="366989">Carole became pregnant with Michael's child.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.205" offset="381618">Victoria, the child, was born in May of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.407" offset="398336">Michael, Carole and Victoria subsequently had an HLA test done which showed a 98.06, I believe, percent probability of paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.048" offset="440968">In November of 1982, Michael filed suit in the California courts to have himself declared Victoria's father.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.080" offset="545040">In his suit Michael asked to be declared Victoria's father, he asked that the court set a reasonable support level for him to provide, and he asked for the court to allow him visitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.291" offset="609928">After the suit was filed, there came a time when Carole and Victoria lived with Michael, and they lived with Michael throughout most of the third year of Victoria's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.266" offset="661859">During that period Michael was held out by Carole and by himself to the world and to Victoria as Victoria's father.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.491" offset="710760">He cared for the child, he supported the child and the mother, and in all respects he assumed the role of father.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.465" offset="754646">And as a consequence, Victoria came to know him as her daddy and a parent-child relationship developed between the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.289" offset="797905">This lasted until around May of 1984 when Carole broke up with Michael.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.997" offset="1152752">I don't think it was by a good deal, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.984" offset="1172710">But I don't have, I don't have it clearly fixed in my mind what the discrepancy might have been as of that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.805" offset="1203952">In any event, after Carole and Michael broke up, the court below awarded Michael pendente lite visitation for a period of time, and then also ordered an evaluation of the situation by an independent court-appointed psychologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.003" offset="1292769">And that evaluation did take place prior to the granting of the summary judgment motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.955" offset="1312517">The psychologist interviewed and examined Michael, Carole, Gerald and Victoria, wrote an extensive report.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.828" offset="1348044">And his bottom-line recommendation was that Michael be recognized as a parent of Victoria and allowed visitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.417" offset="1382421">And this recommendation was based solely on his assessment, that is they psychologist's assessment of what was in Victoria's best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.891" offset="1424321">After that report came out, Gerald filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted in January of 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.484" offset="1482731">In granting the motion for summary judgment, the trial court applied the conclusive presumption of California Evidence Code Section 621.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.542" offset="1530901">And based on that provision he adjudicated Gerald to be the father and terminated the relationship between Michael and Victoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.898" offset="1564338">What Section 621 says is that, given certain predicate facts, a child conceived by a married woman is conclusively presumed to the child of that woman's husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.459" offset="1634555">Michael and Victoria appealed, and the summary judgment decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.167" offset="1685441">In affirming the lower court's granting of summary judgment, I believe that what the Court of Appeal did was close a question left open by the California Supreme Court in a previous case called Michelle W..</text>
            <text syncTime="405.712" offset="1759629">In that case the California Supreme Court left open the question of whether Section 621 could be Constitutionally applied to terminate an ongoing parent-child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.472" offset="1818666">The Court of Appeal, without saying so explicitly but in logic, necessarily answered that question, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.445" offset="6206506">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.564" offset="6230956">Although I hadn't intended to do so, I think I should begin with a slight reference to the facts of this case, because I don't think all of the facts that are relevant have been made known to you today by Mr. Boraks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.872" offset="6276200">I represent the husband, Gerald.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.276" offset="6293859">It is Gerald who was, while cohabiting with his wife, learns that his wife is pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.014" offset="6316847">He joins her in Lamaze training, he participate in the birth of the child, he is living with his wife and his daughter during her early months and doing all that we would normally expect of a father to do for his daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.873" offset="6380272">On the child's first birthday he receives a telephone call from Michael H., informing him for the first time of Michael's claim of biological responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.831" offset="6432099">Six months later, when Victoria is 18 months old, Michael commences this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.937" offset="6460520">At the time that the action was commenced, Michael had virtually no relationship whatsoever with Victoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.441" offset="6490509">I, in fact, was retained as counsel for Carole when this case was first filed and she was first served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.463" offset="6526558">And our immediate response was to file a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.831" offset="6548083">The record will reflect that shortly after Carole responded to the complaint with her answer, she filed a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.271" offset="6573787">At that time there was no relationship that Mr. Boraks speaks of that may have given Michael any Constitutionally protected interest in a relationship with Victoria.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.929" offset="6648498">--It happens to span the end of January to the beginning of March of 1982, which was when Victoria was approximately seven months old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.635" offset="6679322">And Carole had visited Michael at his residence in the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.754" offset="6695727">And that was during a period of separation from Gerald.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.573" offset="6715058">The relationship that Mr. Boraks refers to as being a significant one, and one which confers on Michael the Constitutional right to interfere with the relationship between Carole and her husband, my client, is one that developed during the pendency of this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.535" offset="6790917">When Carole had filed a summary judgment motion, the record will reflect that on the eve of the hearing there was a meeting that occurs between Michael and Carole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.527" offset="6834803">And Carole then took her motion off calendar, and then allowed access, Michael access to Victoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.549" offset="6870956">I would also point out that that period, that eight month period that Mr. Boraks refers to, was not an eight consecutive month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.304" offset="6905960">There were periods during which Michael was not in Los Angeles, where Carole and Victoria were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.125" offset="6933232">In fact by my count, I count a total of, over that eight month period, of approximately 100 days that Michael spent in the house with Victoria and with Carole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.183" offset="6973461">And when Carole terminated her relationship with Michael, she terminated Michael's relationship with Victoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.837" offset="7000106">Carole returned then to her husband, and she has since been living with her husband and Victoria and the siblings of Victoria in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.227" offset="7041693">You are being asked here to invalidate a longstanding part of California's paternity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.083" offset="7085056">This is a paternity action that we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.035" offset="7096863">You're being told that the statute is applied blindly and mechanically to establish the fact, by presumption, that a husband invariably in every case is the man who is responsible for the conception of his wife's child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.116" offset="7181187">That is a misrepresentation of Section 621's purpose or of its effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.554" offset="7206996">What Section 621 is is a rule for identifying the father of a child which does not look to the facts of conception as the basis for identifying the man on whom the state will confer the rights and impose the obligations of paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.231" offset="7273660">We simply don't think in these cases that the fact of biological responsibility is as significant as, for example, in the traditional paternity action, where a mother is asking an unwilling man who denies responsibility and will have no relationship with the child to suffer the obligation, the financial obligations of raising a child that he does not want and who was not planned, and the man is seeking to avoid that responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.013" offset="9548821">Because in that, under 4601, insofar as it relates to non-parents, the court has the discretion to grant or not grant visitation in the court's discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.900" offset="9988305">But the fact of the matter is that Section 621 says that Michael has no opportunity to develop a relationship with Victoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.340" offset="10022055">It was solely by reason of Carole's acquiescence that Michael even had a chance to see Victoria at any time during her minority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3102.531" offset="12546842">Well, I think the guardian ad litem has an obligation to act in what she perceived to be the child's best interest under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.268" offset="12581846">I think the authority is based on the order of the court establishing the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.088" offset="12597102">And lastly, Your Honors, it is not I alone who stand here to tell you that the relationship was significant or how significant or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.264" offset="12661781">I'm relying on what the California Court of Appeal found and what it based its decision on, which is that we appreciate that Michael H. has shown an interest in Victoria D., almost since her birth, has established an affectionate relationship with her, and has at times even contributed to her support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.762" offset="12735760">So the California Court of Appeal based its decision on the assumption that there was a relationship, but found it, the implications of that to be outweighed by the state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.652" offset="12783302">And our position is, the state interests are legitimate and weighty, but they're insufficient to justify the denial of any right to be heard on the merits of the contention made by Michael or Victoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.210" offset="12833562">That's all I have, Your Honor.</text>
