            <label>Mr. Adam Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="65.824" offset="408294">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.109" offset="413518">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.828" offset="424385">In the 1984 Bankruptcy Act, Congress has neither intended to nor has it in fact abrogated or modified any of the Petitioners' Seventh Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.283" offset="470152">We feel for this reason that this Court need not explore the limits or the margins or the interstices of Congress' power to legislate outside the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.241" offset="514037">This case can be resolved neatly and completely, we submit, with a consideration of just two matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.411" offset="538697">The first matter is the unified jurisdictional structure and court organizational system created in the 1984 Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.350" offset="574433">The second consideration is the entirely legal nature of the cause of action asserted by the Trustee in his complaint and the type of relief he asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.205" offset="613825">Turning to the 1984 Act, what's significant, highly significant, about the Act is that it does not create a separate jurisdictional or juridical entity called the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.680" offset="663771">What it does create are a group of bankruptcy judges who are denominated a "unit" of the district court invested with the power of judicial officers of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.738" offset="707971">What Congress has not done very specifically in the 1984 Act is create out of these... out of these bankruptcy judges an administrative agency, a specialized court of equity or specialized court, a court of any type, or a legislative tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.132" offset="781531">Congress has specifically left these judges as dependent, non-autonomous adjuncts or units of the plenary United States district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.155" offset="821655">Now, it wasn't always this way, and I think a historical look is instructive here.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.369" offset="1014544">Well, if the... if the intent of Congress was to do an unconstitutional act, obviously an interpretation must be arrived at that permits a constitutional construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.812" offset="1068251">It seems to me, though, that the... that the precedent of this Court allows Article III type issues or public rights issues or issues arising out of... out of legislation that Congress enacts to be decided in an adjunct fashion.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Adam Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="256.344" offset="1170442">Well, my argument is that initially... if I could develop it historically, the argument is... and from the 1984 Act... that Congress is investing jurisdiction initially and in the first instance in the United States district court judges and the United States district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.971" offset="1244944">Under the 1984 Act, that jurisdiction need not be shared.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.125" offset="1265528">The United States district court judges, in whom a proceeding is emplaced, may or may not choose to refer that proceeding on to their non-Article III adjuncts.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.683" offset="1315788">They may retain jurisdiction completely within themselves and resolve this issue to completion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Adam Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="324.152" offset="1441593">Well, I think Congress intended, by creating a variety of supervisory techniques that are set forth in 28 157 and in 1334, to so control these adjuncts as to make their decisions essentially fall within the decisions of this Court that... allowing such... such adjudications by judges who themselves are not Article III judges, but are so subject to the control of Article III judges as to meet the requirements of Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.892" offset="1584640">The... the 1984 Act created a bankruptcy system in which judges need not refer these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.433" offset="1630720">They may hear the concept of a plenary suit under the 1898, of a summary suit under the 1898 Act, to use those terms which I think will arise in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.978" offset="1692996">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.895" offset="1696653">Under the 1898 Act and under the 1978 Act, there were distinct bankruptcy courts created, and they were invested with specific jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.917" offset="1736673">Under the 1978 Act, all that jurisdiction was passed through to the bankruptcy court judges and not vested in the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.606" offset="1763422">Under the 1898 Act, United States district court judges were vested with what was called a plenary jurisdiction and bankruptcy judges or referees with a summary jurisdiction, and there was very little cross-fertilization between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.831" offset="1820369">Now, of course, all prior historical distinctions are erased.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.818" offset="1840326">All that jurisdiction is vested, summary and plenary, in United States district court judges who may hear a... a case and proceeding to completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.042" offset="1881182">They may decide claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.458" offset="1886824">They may distribute the last dollar of the estates, and they may decide traditional plenary actions such as avoidance actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.546" offset="1911171">Well, traditional plenary actions under the 1898 Act could be brought in state court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="446.866" offset="1932486">So, it wasn't just a question of vesting federal... federal district judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.735" offset="1947951">They were just the kind of lawsuits that you try in courts of first instance, the same way we do lots of other lawsuits.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="adam_lawrence" startTime="458.241" stopTime="548.216">
            <label>Mr. Adam Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="458.241" offset="1978044">That's absolutely correct, and that's my point that there were... that there are ordinary civil or equitable proceedings, legal equitable proceedings, that fell under the rubric of... of plenary and that there were summary or traditionally administrative type equitable proceedings that were exclusively the realm of the bankruptcy judges or referees.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.202" offset="2053799">Now, of course, those distinctions... I think it's critical to understand in the 1984 Act... are erased.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.523" offset="2079086">These cases may be... proceedings may be referred to the bankruptcy judges, all or part of a proceeding, and a district court judge may withdraw all or part of a proceeding and choose to hear it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.581" offset="2123389">Another important jurisdictional aspect of the 1984 Act is found in 28 1334(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="503.437" offset="2158811">In that section, Congress has stripped from the bankruptcy court judges any power that they possess over the bankruptcy res, over the property of the debtor, over the property of the estate, and vested exclusive jurisdiction of that property in United States district court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.898" offset="2232581">By doing this I think Congress plainly manifested in its intent that the old concept of summary jurisdiction of the 1984 Act is no longer applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.722" offset="2275944">The basis of summary jurisdiction, as that term is used and as some people have equated it to core jurisdiction under the 1984 Act, is that a bankruptcy judge is precisely a judge of equity because of his ability to control the res, to control equitably the access to the res.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.533" offset="2443128">--That's... that's correct, but the notion of summary jurisdiction went further than that I think under the 1898 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.270" offset="2470086">The idea of a bankruptcy referee or a bankruptcy court as a court of equity was based in large part on the... on the conception that it had control, equitable control, over creditor and claimant access to the res.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.212" offset="2529855">What the 1984 Act has done is eliminate that traditional power of bankruptcy judges and vest it entirely in a plenary court, the United States district court, a court of complete legal and equitable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.706" offset="2583876">Now, the core distinction under the 1984 Act is a significant one.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.728" offset="2615954">In the 1978 Act, Congress, as it did in the 1984 Act, vested entire jurisdiction initially in the United States district court and then passed it through en masse to the bankruptcy judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.453" offset="2670811">This Court in Marathon stated that that type of wholesale jurisdictional abdication was... was impermissible, that at least as to state-based causes of actions, that type of investiture of jurisdiction in non-Article III judges without the consent of the parties, with only normal appellate review as... as an Article III control over those judges, was... was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.937" offset="2772793">Congress, it seems to me, responded to Marathon and to that... to that Article III criticism by creating the core/non-core distinctions, and in the core/non-core distinction, Congress placed in the... in the non-core category all those cases which were of concern to this Court under Article III, that is, cases with state-based causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.783" offset="2852206">By default, Congress had to create a second category, which it labeled core, in which it placed all other types of proceedings, including the types of avoidance actions for preferences and fraudulent transfers that... the latter of which is the subject of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.062" offset="2921273">The... the point I think here is significant, and that is that the core/non-core distinction was not an Amendment 7 driven distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.668" offset="2955755">There is nothing in the response of Congress in the core/non-core category that... that suggests any intention to affect the right of jury trial of litigants in bankruptcy-related disputes in Seventh Amendment matters, to abrogate the right, to modify the right, to touch it in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.129" offset="3029525">And you can see in the legislative history of the 1984 Act, to the extent there is a legislative history, that the history is rife with statements about Marathon, about whether bankruptcy judges should be Article I judges or Article III judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.674" offset="3099742">There's no apparent discussion in the legislative history of... of Amendment 7 or of an intent to affect Amendment 7 rights or of a desire to limit access to a jury in traditionally plenary or common law causes of action, such as the one we're dealing with here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.667" offset="7179651">And by the time that objection had been made and when it was rejected, they did not appeal to the Eleventh Circuit on that issue so that whatever question the Court might some day have about the limits of power under the 1984 Act to refer matters for binding decision under Section 157 by these bankruptcy judges who, as Justice Scalia says, are of course Article I entities, is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.116" offset="7277453">And it is important to recognize that this decision against Granfinanciera was not, despite their effort to reconstrue it, rendered by the district court in drag, as it were, sitting as a kind of Article I body in violation of the Constitution... the decision was rendered by the bankruptcy judge or referee subject only to review by the Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.914" offset="7376718">And the question really is whether they are entitled under the Seventh Amendment to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.385" offset="7394586">They would have that question, even if it had, indeed, been decided by the Article III court, but then they would, as Justice Scalia suggests, be in quite a different position because then at least one could understand what they meant by saying that this had been a suit at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.395" offset="7454563">The reason that they want to make it look as though the decision was rendered by an Article III court is somehow to bring the Seventh Amendment in closer proximity to their client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.702" offset="7499807">So, I think the puzzle posed by the case is how the Seventh Amendment comes to apply at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.856" offset="7524467">I do think it's useful to go back for a moment to the Chief Justice's question about Katchen because, as I understand their position... and this makes it in a way more puzzling... if the Petitioners had been among Chase &amp; Sanborn's actual creditors and if the $1.7 million transferred to them on the eve of bankruptcy had been a partial repayment, then they concede they'd have no right to a jury trial about the facts surrounding the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.774" offset="7636166">But, you see, they concede they were not creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.959" offset="7644839">They say it was nonetheless appropriate to shift this money to Granfinanciera because of favors that it had done for the father of the principal officer of the bankrupt corporation, an officer who incidentally is serving now 15 years in the federal penitentiary for bank fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.872" offset="7732506">So, it appears that their position is that because they make no claim on the assets of Chase &amp; Sanborn, they fall outside the bankruptcy claims jurisdiction and therefore they're entitled to a jury before being ordered to turn the $1.7 million over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.620" offset="7811500">So, the paradox is that because they have no legal claim, they're entitled to more process, not less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.539" offset="7839190">Now, of course, sometimes Congress or the Constitution mandates odd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.010" offset="7857058">But I do not think that a persuasive argument has been made that that result is mandated here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.466" offset="7894883">Well, we believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that Schoenthal was simply a decision under the 1898 Act which said that when Congress chooses, as it old in the 1898 Act, by requiring the bringing of a plenary suit in an ordinary common law court... when it chooses to do that, to force the trustee to sue for damages at law on the law side of the district court, then as long as there existed a common law analogue, you're entitled under the Seventh Amendment to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.735" offset="8007941">We think that that's entirely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.337" offset="8018390">But we do not think that Schoenthal stood for the proposition that the Seventh Amendment entitles you to the kind of forum that Congress happened to provide in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.561" offset="8071262">That is, the real question is whether there is in the Seventh Amendment a constitutional rule preventing Congress from placing matters of the kind that Justice Kennedy asked about, namely, 157(b)(2)(H), fraudulent conveyance matters, in the decision power of a bankruptcy judge who is not an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.795" offset="8176170">That's the question in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.745" offset="8384000">But the Court went out its way in Kras to say that the situation of the creditor is really quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.799" offset="8404271">The creditor has no alternative, given the automatic stay of Section 362.</text>

            <text syncTime="2576.904" offset="10452689">--Well, there was some dismemberment I think in Marathon, but it was a very different kind of case, a garden variety contract action created by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.593" offset="10487380">And whether or not the refinements of Marathon in CFTC v. Schor and Thomas v. Union Carbide leave that in place is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.632" offset="10527608">But what does seem clear is that the restructuring of debtor/creditor relations which the Supreme Court ever since Barton v. Barbour in 1881 has recognized as a central exercise of congressional power to put matters in the specialized authority of a special tribunal that does collective justice and not necessarily piecemeal justice... what is clear is that that I think does not raise grave Article III questions even if the issue had been properly preserved here, which it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.587" offset="10659370">But if we are right that, for example, in Katchen it was within the power of the Congress, despite the 1898 scheme that was at issue in Schoenthal... within the power of Congress to force a creditor to submit the preference claims, as well as his own claim as a creditor, to non-jury resolution, we don't think that it would make any sense to read the Seventh Amendment to point to a different result when one is a fraudulent transferee rather than the recipient of a preferential payment as a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.331" offset="10818403">That is, the two go hand in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.783" offset="10828121">Indeed, one of the more remarkable things is that the Petitioners in their brief at page 12 and again in the oral argument stress that for Seventh Amendment purposes there is no justification for treating differently the situation of a preferential transfer or the situation of a fraudulent conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.827" offset="10908369">They make the point... and I think it's quite right, and it has been recognized all the way back to Chancellor Kent and to Justice Story... that the basic policy of nondiscriminatory distribution that underlies the bankruptcy law is equally frustrated... the basic public purposes of the bankruptcy law equally frustrated by both kinds of transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.758" offset="10988095">And therefore, the constitutional power of Congress to place in the hands of a specialized non-jury utilizing tribunal the authority to undo the eve-of-calamity wrongs that were done is really coextensive with respect to the kind of preferential treatment of a favored creditor that was involved in Katchen and the kind of out-and-out gift, as it were, that's involved in... in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.664" offset="11127693">In fact, it's quite interesting to take a historical perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.347" offset="11138455">In all of the bankruptcy laws Congress has passed, it has never distinguished for purposes of whether something falls within the central bankruptcy process or whether one must bring a plenary action... it has never distinguished preferential transfer claims from fraudulent conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.279" offset="11222152">That is, during the 1890... under the 1898 regime in both of these cases, there was a requirement by statute that you go to the law side of an ordinary court and bring a lawsuit as the trustee although I think a careful reading of the statutes of 1800 and 1841 and 1867 suggests that that was not always so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.609" offset="11311491">But Congress has never created the anomaly that the Petitioners' reading of Katchen would create, an anomaly which says that you have a Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial if you simply receive a completely unjustified, under-the-table payment on the eve of bankruptcy, but no Seventh Amendment right to jury trial if you are a creditor and must go into bankruptcy in order to collect the remainder of the debt, part of which was preferentially paid on the eve of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.164" offset="11441685">It would make no sense in terms of the Bankruptcy Clause or the Seventh Amendment to reach any such conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.984" offset="11468957">But let me suppose for the moment, to go back to Justice Kennedy's question... let me suppose that we were in the district court and we didn't have any additional mileage out of the fact that this was decided by a specialized tribunal of the sort, Mr. Chief Justice, that in your Park Lane dissent you stressed Congress could set up, despite the Seventh Amendment, to resolve bankruptcy and other kinds of special claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.616" offset="11563520">Suppose we were in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.551" offset="11571252">And suppose we did not want to make the existence of a Seventh Amendment right to jury trial turn on the decision of the district court to refer the matter for final decision to an Article I body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.776" offset="11616183">Even there it is simply not the case, as the Petitioners suggest, that an action to recover a fraudulent transfer is somehow inherently legal and therefore jury triable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.166" offset="11665711">In their brief, they make the following quite remarkable statement about late 18th century English law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.820" offset="11692356">They say equity would not entertain an action for the return of fraudulently transferred money or goods, and they cite principally two cases: Hobbs from 1788 and Scudamore from 1796.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.199" offset="11753796">And what's remarkable about those cases is they show the very opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.151" offset="11765603">In those cases the chancellor said equity will entertain such actions if it's equitable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.888" offset="11792562">And in both cases on the facts the chancellor sent the creditor to the law side saying it would not be equitable in this particular case to grant that relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.628" offset="12047517">That is, in most areas it is true that in the choice between law and equity, there was an overwhelming preference for law with equity being seen as a last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.186" offset="12085760">But the observation was made by Chancellor Kent, quoted then by Justice Story in 1836, that when it comes to fraudulent conveyances, since it may so often be the case that an execution at law will not quite do, there ought to be a generally available equitable remedy to order a return of the assets or of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.949" offset="12176875">And even though there is some historical dispute about the various periods in which the preferences went one way or the other, what is clear is that in Section 550 of the Bankruptcy Code and in 551, Congress in codifying the law with respect to fraudulent conveyances did not put the preference on the law side.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.843" offset="12336431">When you seek an injunction, for example, you have to show that there is no adequate legal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.664" offset="12355657">But under the substantive statutes governing bankruptcy, if you seek a turnover of property, you do not have to show that money might not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.286" offset="12394214">In this case the reason the decree was as broad as it was and the reason it said shall turn over the $1.7 million is that, of course, Granfinanciera and Medex commingled the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.828" offset="12444369">It would have been pointless to insist, as I guess, Justice Scalia, you suggested in... in a... in a footnote in Bowen v.

            <text syncTime="3088.087" offset="12497345">The regime in fraudulent conveyance law doesn't operate in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.122" offset="12517512">The regime in fraudulent conveyance law, going back to 1571, did not have the requirement that when you want to return something to the res or to the estate, that you show that money won't be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.315" offset="12578325">But in any event that wouldn't be a fruitful inquiry here because it is the duty of the trustee in bankruptcy ultimately in a situation like this where it is a liquidating trustee to reduce everything to money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.190" offset="12625763">And what I think is happening is that the Petitioners are engaged in a kind of play on words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.593" offset="12647393">They are suggesting that because one couldn't find the particular wire transfer that had gone to Granfinanciera or the particular checks that had gone to Medex that it, therefore, follows that because one was ordering restitution of money, that that was the same as money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.524" offset="12731089">Now, there may be some contexts as the dissenters, the three dissenters in Bowen v. Massachusetts, suggested where the play on words is the other way and where it's just a cute thing to describe something as restitution where really one is getting the payment of a past due sum, as you suggested in that case, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.824" offset="12828369">But here it is as clear as anything could be that the Respondent was not asking for the payment of a past due sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.478" offset="12862955">The Respondent was asking for a restoration of the status quo, for a reversal of an improper eve-of-bankruptcy transfer that ought never to have occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.471" offset="13642867">Actually, Justice Stevens, the way the chancellor analyzed the matter in Hobbs in particular doesn't confirm that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.808" offset="13672228">What the chancellor in Hobbs said was that there would be peculiar hardships attending an equitable decree and therefore you ought to go to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.998" offset="13705038">That's why Judge Friendly in Damsky v. Zavatt in 1981 cited the Hobbs case which the Petitioners use to prove that an action will not lie in equity, cited it to precisely the opposite effect to show that an action to avoid a fraudulent conveyance and to rescind it is quintessentially equitable in character even if in the end the particular relief has to be dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.750" offset="13820082">In Katchen, this Court said that equity courts generally have power to decree complete relief and for that purpose may accord what would otherwise be legal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.106" offset="13861460">That's really all we have here with the fact that it was an award of a specific amount of money so that it's stretching a great deal to treat this as an action at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.645" offset="13899598">It's stretching even more to treat this command to disgorge as though it were somehow a legal rather than an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.583" offset="13939409">And every circuit that has construed the matter has seen turnover orders as essentially injunctive, enforceable in appropriate cases by contempt if one has personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.291" offset="13986220">And so the fact that in this particular case what one has is a judgment for money does not make it an action at law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="3475.868" offset="14048496">But it seems to us that there are two independent reasons apart from the nationalization of Granfinanciera, which as to that Petitioner, pretty clearly eliminates a right to jury trial... two independent reasons for saying that the effort by Congress to comply with Marathon, whatever else may be said about it, did not violate the Seventh Amendment either on its face or as applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.999" offset="14145045">And we, therefore, believe that the judgment which was entered against the Petitioners, not by an Article III court which affirmed the bankruptcy judge's decree, but by a specialized bankruptcy tribunal is not infirm on the ground that they were denied a jury which, by the way, they would never have been able to claim had they been in the more equitable position of a creditor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Adam Lawrence</label>
            <text syncTime="3531.385" offset="14270537">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.054" offset="14277224">On the issue of money damages, there are certain similarities here between compensatory remedies and what was sought and achieved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.060" offset="14309303">First of all, the... the award under 548-550 is not a discretionary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.047" offset="14333231">If you prove the criteria for avoidance which isn't a separate, independent equitable action in and of itself, you're entitled to that amount of dollars without any intercession of a... of the discretionary mind of a jury or a... or a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.390" offset="14394566">The... the payment here was of sums which will go to compensate creditor claimants for common law torts committed against them, for common law breaches of contract committed against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.566" offset="14451304">In a very real sense the use to which these... this judgment will be put, if it's recovered, is to compensate those who have state law claims who are essentially, I gather, unsecured creditors for a variety of state law claims that characterize claimants in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.445" offset="14522775">To the extent the trustee recovers money in avoidance actions, he... he pays off people who are seeking damages in the classical legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.317" offset="14558302">To the extent he doesn't recover dollars, these people go uncompensated in classical legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.705" offset="14579827">I think it's deceptive to speak of the dollars in dispute here as not being compensatory at least in the final analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.274" offset="14610129">Secondly, I think it's... it's unnecessary and unwise to base the Seventh Amendment jurisprudence on the arcane distinctions between a compensatory dollar and... and a restitutionary dollar when those terms, as we all know, can be intermingled and... and... and converted from one to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.653" offset="14679615">Seemingly, in response to Justice Stevens' questions, I think the proper basis of equity jurisdiction and legal jurisdiction is still... is the judgment... is to relieve something that's uniquely within the power of a court of law to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.246" offset="14734054">Money judgments and whether the dollar composing the judgment is a compensatory dollar or a restitutionary dollar is still a traditionally legal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.999" offset="14769058">And I think that's the basis on which a Seventh Amendment jurisprudence should... should rest, not this confusion definition between compensatory and restitutionary.</text>
