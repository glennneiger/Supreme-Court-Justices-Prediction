            <text syncTime="301.789" offset="1344006">Well, the thing that's curious, if the thing... if the boat hull was patentable, it is curious that if the Florida statute is valid it would in effect grant a, a right in perpetuity that under the patent law would be limited.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Tomas Morgan Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="320.162" offset="1417567">The right... may I first back to, Justice O'Connor, and fully answer your, your prior question as to whether it would be a sculptural work?</text>
            <text syncTime="328.948" offset="1452676">It quite clearly is not under 301 for three reasons: 301 preempts as to the subject matter of copyright, as specified in 102, but 102(b) specifically excludes a process.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.687" offset="1519653">Secondly, 301 applies to subject matter of copyright and 102 includes pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.645" offset="1559464">And that phrase is defined in 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.637" offset="1571480">In 101 there is an exclusion, and the exclusion is that if the design of the useful article shall be considered a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work, only if and only to the extent that such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from and capable of existing independently of the utilitarian aspects of the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.613" offset="1683389">Now, these boats are clearly utilitarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.685" offset="1691644">So, it would be considered a sculptural work only if some aesthetic feature could be separated and identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.521" offset="1722991">The third ground is that Section 301 really doesn't apply here because the Florida statute does not create a right equivalent to any of the exclusive rights specified in Section 106, and that is the right to reproduce copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.517" offset="1818912">The Florida statute just does not create any such right to reproduce copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.840" offset="1840228">Justice O'Connor, would you help me by giving your question again on the patent law?</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="441.131" offset="1901459">Well, it just struck me that if this boat hull could have been patented and wasn't, but the owners of it want to be protected under Florida's special law, Florida's law would give them a right in perpetuity that the patent law would give only for a limited period of time.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Tomas Morgan Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="466.837" offset="2004277">That is correct, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.909" offset="2016502">The same thing was true with the protection of the sound recording master recording in Goldstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.045" offset="2045028">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.645" offset="2051507">But the right that is granted for the protection of the industry in Florida is exceedingly narrow, and we, we submit does not conflict with the purposes and effects of the Federal patent law.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.971" offset="2256724">I might add that the Florida statute does not distinguish... does not operate as against a patented product.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.061" offset="5405107">Whether you can practice your invention is is a question of whether the sale or distribution of that product would violate other laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles E. Lipsey</label>
            <text syncTime="1394.841" offset="5716277">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.550" offset="5771134">I would like to refocus the Court's attention for a moment on five basic principles which I think are fundamentally undisputed and which I think govern the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.726" offset="5807810">The first is that the Federal patent law seeks to strike a balance between incentives for innovation and preservation of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.123" offset="5845427">The second point is that the patentability standards which Congress has adopted to effect that policy reflect not only what Congress wished to be protectable but also that which Congress wished to remain in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.722" offset="5903732">The third point, where there's no dispute, is that the boat design and the boat manufacturing process involved in this case are both squarely within the technological subject matter covered by the patent law, addressed by the patent law, but equally clearly fail to meet the patentability standards which Congress has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.345" offset="5986279">They are in the public domain because the boat proprietor here chose not to avail itself of the protections afforded by the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.440" offset="6018671">The fourth point which I think is not in dispute is that had a patent issued on the boat itself, among the rights which would have been conveyed to the proprietor would have been the right to exclude others from making that boat by any technique, including making that boat by the direct molding technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.925" offset="6096620">In fact, had a product... had a patent issued on the process of making the boat, that would have directly prohibited others from manufacturing the boat by the direct molding technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.062" offset="6137162">And the last point, which I think... is not in dispute, is that the Florida statute, for the purpose of striking a balance between incentive for innovation and competition, has chosen to give to this boat manufacturer a right to exclude others from making his boat by the direct molding process under circumstances where the Federal patent law would have denied that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.557" offset="6235069">And when one analyzes that scenario under applicable authority of this Court in the federal preemption area, one is led to the conclusion that the Florida statute interferes with attainment of the full objectives of the federal patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.674" offset="6291598">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.315" offset="6294106">Because it strikes the balance in a different place than Congress would have struck it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.046" offset="6361084">The trilogy of cases upon which the Petitioner relies really don't address the area addressed by the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.812" offset="6388147">The patent law deals with the rights of the public and the rights of inventor... the inventor to use things which are publicly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.276" offset="6413956">It doesn't purport to address contractual obligations of confidence or rights of privacy from industrial espionage addressed by the Trade Secret Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.860" offset="6448333">The subject of the Trade Secret Law by definition is not in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.264" offset="6461916">Just to mention the Goldstein case while we're on it, that case... the whole ratio desidende of that case was that the area addressed by the State of California was one left wholly untouched by the federal government and the copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.162" offset="6517505">The federal copyright law simply didn't deal with sound recordings at that time, and since there had been no balance struck there was no interference with a federal balance by the state choosing to act in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.160" offset="6565570">Now, they specifically distinguished the patent situation in the Goldstein case where there had been a comprehensive scheme of federal regulation enacted that dealt with virtually everything under the sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.858" offset="6608307">That's how this Court has interpreted the scope of the patent law and where the balance had in fact been struck.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.968" offset="6860754">The first is... where the house is being built in a secluded area surrounded by a fence, and the idea of the house has never been disclosed to anybody who has... who doesn't have an obligation of confidence to the designer, and the photograph is taking by flying over the fence for the purpose of taking a photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.000" offset="6924911">That violates the law, but it doesn't violate the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.800" offset="6940062">That's the trade secret theft, that's a discovery by improper means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.185" offset="6957616">Now, let me posit the other scenario, which is the house is built on the corner of 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue out here, and as it is arising it is in plain view of the public and a man takes a photograph of it, as he's entitled to take a photograph of anything in the public domain, and uses that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.072" offset="8225182">One is the answer which is in the opinion of the Supreme Court, Court of Florida, and that is that when you undertake, for purposes of striking a balance between innovation and competition, to tamper with the resources that are in the public domain that are available to a man who's entitled to copy, you interfere indirectly with the right which Sears and Compco says you may not interfere with directly, and that statute, that act ought also to be preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.893" offset="8656411">The Federal law of supremacy and preemption is not a black letter, inflexible thing, and the interest which the state is seeking to protect is certainly a relevant inquiry in making the preemption analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.252" offset="8713880">And I think the authorities of this Court indicate that where the state is acting in the heart of its police power, dealing with the health and safety of its citizens, that greater deference is given state action in that area than it might be where the state is acting in a peripheral, commercial sort of arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.192" offset="8773649">And so that's why I focused on that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.214" offset="8789740">Secondly, differences in the state's objectives manifest themselves in differences in the vehicles adopted in the statute to attain the goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.529" offset="8818997">If you're interested in protecting health and safety, you prevent everybody from doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.501" offset="8838850">You create no private right to exclude others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.323" offset="8850135">But when you're interested in balancing incentive for innovation against the right to compete, the vehicle one adopts is to give an exclusionary right to the proprietor, just as the patent law adopts giving an exclusionary right to the proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.333" offset="8910217">And so the difference in objective of the statute is reflected in adoption of a vehicle which directly collides with the statutory scheme in the patent law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.137" offset="9421485">It doesn't purport to deal with licensing techniques, with safety concerns, with any of these other matters cited in the cases in the Petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.494" offset="9462863">And, and so the preemption issue is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.786" offset="9480000">Is the state creating a property right, a right to exclude others, in technology of the sort which the patent law deals with and says should be free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.913" offset="9524512">And I, I think we've established pretty clearly that it does in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.347" offset="9538305">I'd like to just mention that this argument that it's police power, it's police power, is kind of a recoherring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.223" offset="9569756">Even if you concede that it is within the police power of the state, all that does is establish the right of the state to act absent the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.856" offset="9600267">It begs the question of whether or not it's an exercise of police power, which is nonetheless preempted because it clashes with the objectives of the federal patent law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.989" offset="9680829">There is that language, but the same argument that it's police power, it's police power, could have been made in Sears-Compco as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.174" offset="9705593">And, and so obviously there are some police powers which are not preempted and there are some which may be exercised in a way which is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.451" offset="9742687">And let me give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.692" offset="9747702">Suppose the State of Florida wanted to promote innovation in boat hull design, but did so by granting tax credits for investments made in manufacture of an original boat hull.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.736" offset="9787827">They achieved the same goal, but they do so without withdrawing anything from the public domain, without giving to the proprietor a right to exclude others from using technology that's already out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.154" offset="9833489">That would not have been preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.467" offset="9842788">But the vehicle they've chosen to effect this policy happens to be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.101" offset="9865253">I'd like to mention briefly the interpart opinion of the federal circuit, which is cited and relied upon heavily by the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.346" offset="9898272">As with any lower court authority, I think its value here is only for the thoroughness and logic of its analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.900" offset="9936516">The interpart opinion didn't deal at all with the flip side of the federal patent law coin, which is this policy of protecting competition in things that are in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.196" offset="9973714">It did not deal at all with the process patent aspects of the right, which is given by the State of Florida, and it's wholly unsatisfying sort of analysis, and I don't think that it really alters the analysis in this Court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.746" offset="10023869">Finally, I would like to address the point they make, they reap where they do not sow, it's unfair, and there caught to be a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.061" offset="10057097">As the questions of Mr. Russell pointed out, the question of whether it's unfair is something we have to analyze in light of what the law permits, what the patent law permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.568" offset="10099206">And in 1938 this Court decided the Kellogg case and said, it's not unfair to use something that the patent law leaves in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.113" offset="10133374">And that was the essence of the Sears and Compco holdings in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.155" offset="10149466">And it's apparently time to say that again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.408" offset="10158556">Secondly, they're really not reaping where they do not sow, to carry the agricultural analogy further they are gathering what nature leaves in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.874" offset="10200352">It is in the very nature of technological processes that once they are publicly disclosed they force themselves into the possession of everybody who learns of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.320" offset="10234207">And that person can be dispossessed of the right to use them only by the issuance of a valid patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.524" offset="10258971">And finally, when they say there ought to be a law, there is a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.595" offset="10271301">There's the Federal Patent Law, there's the Federal Design Patent Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.948" offset="10284676">It provides protection in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.810" offset="10296169">They should use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.892" offset="10300453">If it's inadequate they should go to Congress and ask them to change it, or to modify it, or embellish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.683" offset="10319575">And in fact requests have been before Congress for years to modify the patent law in the area of industrial designs and to allow some more limited, easier to obtain protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.424" offset="10370566">That's where the debate is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.733" offset="10375791">I think that's where it ought to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.135" offset="10381433">The dispute is much broader than just boat hulls in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.768" offset="10395957">There are 12 statutes dealing with this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.909" offset="10408496">Three of them deal with every manufactured article that there is, not just boat hulls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.060" offset="10425110">One of those statutes is being used to try to stifle competition in the automobiles aftermarket for crash part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.475" offset="10450814">The economic stakes are immerse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.556" offset="10459069">The divergent interests are immense and of national scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.170" offset="10477564">And it's the sort of thing which really is peculiarly within the ken of Congress, and I would urge the Court to leave it there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.604" offset="10575262">First of all, the fact that a patent has not issued on a product really is independent and free and has nothing to do with the exercise of the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.944" offset="10624685">The police power can be used by the states to legitimately regulate competition, whether or not a product is patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.210" offset="10661779">I cite you to the Sears case itself when it discussed what laws were applicable to patented products, and they even cited the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.931" offset="10716636">The citation was to IBM, in the 1936 decision, and the United Shoe Machinery case in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.583" offset="10751222">And that certainly is, is as true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.855" offset="10764284">Florida, Florida and 11 other states have exercised their police power, saying that this is an improper method of competition between competitors.</text>
