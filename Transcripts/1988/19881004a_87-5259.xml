            <text syncTime="62.888" offset="386149">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the petitioner in this case was tried before a jury from which all black representation was removed by use of the peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.880" offset="446126">Although 11 of the 32 jurors who withstood challenges for cause were black, the prosecutor exercised all 10 of the peremptory challenges allotted to him by statute to remove 10 black jurors from that panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.692" offset="521359">The defense exercised one of its challenges against the remaining black juror... she was married to a police officer, and his client was charged with attempted murder of a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.816" offset="569842">The result was that the petitioner was tried before a jury which was not representative of the community which was 25 percent black.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.957" offset="606413">This case thus presents the question of whether the Sixth Amendment bars the prosecutor's use of the peremptory challenge to defeat the possibility that the petit jury will be representative of a fair cross section of the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.862" offset="1054048">It's the Respondent's position, and they find support for this position in language of this Court in Lockhart v. McCree, that extension of the fair cross section requirement to the petit jury would be unworkable and unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.272" offset="1111726">That so long as all distinctive groups in the community are represented on the jury pool... the Sixth Amendment imposes no limitation on the ability of the prosecutor to remove those same distinctive groups from the petit jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.890" offset="1342126">Our position is that the language in the opinion suggesting that the Sixth Amendment doesn't extend to the petit jury was unnecessary to the result reached in that case, and thereby doesn't necessarily bind this Court in the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.121" offset="1423106">As I was saying, acceptance of that argument would result in the State of Louisiana, for instance, in response to this Court's decision in Taylor, rather than providing that women would be excluded from the jury pool by use of a statutory exemption, could provide that women are entitled to be included in the jury pool, but that the parties can exercise challenges for cause against women, once they are represented on the jury pool, on the assumption that their family responsibilities would cause them to be inattentive jurors, and therefore unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.685" offset="1609306">This, of course, I think would be an absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.304" offset="1623831">It would allow the prosecution to achieve the same result which this Court found to be offensive in Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.725" offset="1653506">The fair cross section requirement has no meaning or purpose unless its importance is recognized to extend beyond selection of the jury pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.967" offset="1702407">The jury pool itself is not a deliberative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.288" offset="1727693">It is the petit jury which provides the defendant with the benefit of the common sense judgement of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.060" offset="1762802">The defendant has no interest in a jury pool which is representative of the community separate from the impact that that jury pool, the representative character of that jury pool could have on the petit jury before which he is tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.871" offset="1842110">The representative jury pool is not an end in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.342" offset="1863948">It merely provides the means and the possibility that the petit jury will be similarly representative of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.548" offset="1896758">The exclusion of cognizable groups from the jury pool violates the Sixth Amendment only because it serves to exclude those same jurors from the jury... from the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.458" offset="1956422">We are not asking that this Court impose any requirement that the petit jury be of any particular composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.384" offset="2008144">We are not asking that any quotas be imposed, we're not asking that any affirmative action be taken to achieve a certain result.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.656" offset="2049209">All we're saying is that the statistical impossibility that each and every petit jury will mirror the community should not excuse a deliberate perversion of the process to achieve an unrepresentative jury.</text>

Italian background, or Hispanic in certain parts of the country, or whatever it might be... on the basis of their race or their religion at the petit jury level might work at cross purposes with the goal of giving parties through the peremptory challenge the right to obtain a degree of impartiality, in effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="550.752" offset="2337600">Our argument is that disallowing peremptory challenges to allow the petit jury the possibility of being representative in fact furthers the goal of a fair and impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.846" offset="2385979">The prosecutor would not be disallowed from using his peremptory challenges to exclude members of a group if he has a reasoned basis to question the bias of the jury, of the juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.141" offset="2459122">The only thing that he's going to be prevented from doing... and he's not going to be required to accept jurors merely because they're members of a certain group.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.013" offset="2498619">All that he's going to be prevented from doing is making assumptions about the partiality of the juror based on their group identity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.919" offset="6162240">Based on my experience in pre-Batson cases, it was not unusual for a defense counselor to make the complaint towards the later stages of jury selection, when it became apparent that there was a discriminatory inference to be concluded from the manner in which the prosecutor was exercising its challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.419" offset="6264222">Certainly under Batson this Court recognizes that disproportionate exclusion is one of the kinds of evidence that can be looked to to determine whether or not a prosecutor is discriminating, and certainly that is not going to be apparent until the later stages of jury selection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.256" offset="6383654">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, your Honors, the Petitioner invokes the Sixth Amendment as the Constitutional basis for the relief he seeks in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.752" offset="6473620">The core guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is the right to an impartial jury, but the petitioner does not contend that he did not get an impartial jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.393" offset="6512177">What he does contend is that he did not get a jury which was representative of a cross section of the community because the peremptory challenge was used with the result that one distinctive group within the community did not ultimately participate in the jury's deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.153" offset="6571213">Your Honors, the Petitioner's argument blurs the distinction between cross sectionalism and impartiality, and it is absolutely crucial to remember that they are not the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.210" offset="6619383">In Lockhart v. McCree, this Court defined impartiality, for purposes of analysis of a jury, in terms of a jury consisting of individuals, each of whom was willing to consider the case fairly and to render a decision based on the evidence, and not on extraneous or irrelevant influences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.272" offset="6699631">The Court also specifically rejected the notion that jury impartiality can be determined with reference to some hypothetical mix of viewpoints from within the community on the petit jury itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.516" offset="6756683">I don't mean for any of this to imply that the Respondents are denigrating the cross section principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.073" offset="6794926">The cross section principle does serve a very valuable purpose in the jury trial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.691" offset="6817391">But it must be remembered that the cross section principle is a protective measure, and it was designed to enhance the fairness of jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.833" offset="6853963">But the peremptory challenge does that too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.333" offset="6863889">The peremptory challenge serves as a backstop to the process of voir dire examination and challenge for cause, and it also serves to ensure that the jury which is ultimately selected is one that is composed of individuals that both parties are able to agree upon as being the fairest and most able to render a just verdict from the choices available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.448" offset="6952392">Having a cross section of the community represented in a petit jury would be a good thing if we could get it on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.820" offset="6993875">But a cross section of biased and partial people does not serve the ends of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.808" offset="7013832">The peremptory challenge may result in some juries which are less cross sectional, but its purpose is to ensure that while a jury may be less cross sectional, it is nevertheless more fair and satisfactory to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.484" offset="7072555">The argument has been made that if the cross sectional principle is not extended to the petit jury, that the beneficial effects of the holding in Taylor v. Louisiana--</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.955" offset="8430400">Because to equate jury impartiality, which once again is what the Sixth Amendment is all about, with some sort of mix on the jury or representative viewpoints being included on the petit jury is to take dangerous step toward the process of actually being required, or enforcing a requirement, that juries be filled by quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.821" offset="8529875">Now, the argument has been made that if the cross section requirement is not extended to the petit jury, then Taylor v. Louisiana will be rendered a nullity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.016" offset="8590688">The fact that Taylor requires that the jury pool be all-inclusive means that if, in a situation where previously an entire group was either drastically underrepresented or completed excluded, a litigant would be able, in a situation such as that, to direct his or her peremptory challenges against the next most disfavored individuals or groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.334" offset="8695909">But when you have a pool which is all-inclusive, then the peremptory challenge is going to be exercised in a different way by the litigants, and it means that people who previously might have been peremptorily challenged will now in fact sit on juries that they wouldn't have been on before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.443" offset="8764350">And that has the function of shifting the spectrum of attitude which actually appears on the petit jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2573.057" offset="10426782">I agree that... but again it's important to note the language in Allen v. Hardy, which indicates that while the rule of Batson has an incidental or residual effect on jury impartiality, it was not that... that idea was not the main thrust of the Batson opinion, and was not the main goal that the Court was seeking to promote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.637" offset="10513091">Batson, I think, also recognizes the fact that applying a concept of proportional representation at the petit jury level is a virtual impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.480" offset="10568471">Batson indicates that it would be impossible to get any trial jury to proportionally reflect all of the various and distinctive groups from within the community, because of the heterogeneous nature of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.406" offset="10628239">Now, this leads... if the Petitioner's position were to be adopted, this would lead to two very immediate and very serious problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.095" offset="10658959">The first problem would be defining what groups are cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.964" offset="10678498">The Petitioner has indicated this afternoon, and I agree, that this Court's previous cases have held that groups defined by race, gender and ethnic origin are cognizable groups... but this Court's opinions have suggested, and many lower courts have found, that groups defined also by economic or political or occupational status are cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.495" offset="10768569">That groups defined by religion or age or geographic location are all cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.566" offset="10792810">The point is that whether or not a group would be cognizable for purposes of a cross section analysis is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.505" offset="10824575">To determine that question, trial courts would be required to hold evidentiary hearings at which demographic and sociological studies would have to be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.778" offset="10861669">And this of course would impose a tremendous burden on our already overburdened trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.265" offset="10883612">Furthermore, the results of any such hearings would be transient, because the population is transient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.269" offset="10907644">A ruling today that some group is or is not cognizable in a certain time and a certain location in a certain community might not be a valid opinion five years from now, so this would be a recurring, a constantly recurring thing that the trial courts would have to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.445" offset="10972324">Moreover, since it is impossible to get a literal cross section of the community on any one trial jury, a defendant could almost always object to the composition of a jury on the basis of the absence or underrepresentation of one group or another, following jury selection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.372" offset="12884069">All we're saying is that the jury as an institution serves the purpose that it was intended to serve, so long as the State provides the possibility of a representational jury, and only if there's some affirmative interference with that possibility is the Sixth Amendment violated.</text>
