            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="152109">We'll hear argument next in No. 86-1088, the City of Canton v. Geraldine Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.445" offset="177813">Mr. Phillips, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="65.152" offset="412707">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.004" offset="424096">Canton, Ohio is a relatively small city in the Northeastern part of the State of Ohio whose fame heretofore has been based largely on William McKinley and the professional football hall of fame.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.284" offset="469236">Unfortunately, unfortunately today we have a new reason for fame, you're right, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.388" offset="493582">It is before this Court because the Sixth Circuit has ordered it to face a new trial under 42 USC Section 1983 for failure to provide adequate medical care to a detainee in the city's jails.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.316" offset="541333">The legal issue in this case, one this Court has confronted somewhat often in recent years, is under what circumstances the city is liable for the Constitution torts committed by its employees?</text>
            <text syncTime="108.422" offset="585742">The case arises out of the arrest of the Respondent, Mrs. Geraldine Harris, on April 26th, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.175" offset="612805">Mrs. Harris was stopped for speeding by a Canton police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.189" offset="628791">There is no question that the stop at that time was a perfectly lawful act by the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.733" offset="646973">Apparently upset by her sense that others around her were also speeding, she became quite agitated and refused to provide the police officer with information necessary to allow him to fill out his ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.340" offset="697441">Consistent with the standard practice in the State of Ohio and the City of Canton at the time, the officer decided that the best response was to place Mrs. Harris under arrest and to have her transported to the police station in the hopes that she might calm down and provide the officers with the necessary information.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.140" offset="760658">And there's never been any challenge to the lawfulness of the city's action in having Mrs. Harris brought to the police station at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.625" offset="786571">Mrs. Harris became quite agitated, as a consequence of this decision, and apparently became unable to walk without assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.769" offset="815097">She was therefore assisted by two police officers into a patrol wagon and taken to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.442" offset="837876">At the station Mrs. Harris was asked about her medical condition, whether she had a medical condition, whether she needed any medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.638" offset="866610">And her response to that question, as well as all other questions that were provided to Mrs. Harris, was that she wanted to see her son, Ronny, and she wanted to see him immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.722" offset="898898">The reason Mrs. Harris was asked that question is that the City of Canton has a specific written policy which provides that the officer who's assigned as the jailer</text>
            <text syncTime="197.200" offset="940902">"shall when a prisoner is found unconscious or semi-conscious or when he or she is unable to explain his or her condition, or who complains of being ill, has such person taken to a hospital for medical treatment, with the permission of a supervisor before admitting a person to the city jail. "</text>
            <text syncTime="213.771" offset="1007149">Although Mrs. Harris' behavior was extreme under the circumstances, the testimony is undisputed that it was not uncommon for inmates to become hysterical as a consequence of being brought to the police station, especially if they'd never been there previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.340" offset="1073396">For that reason the decision was made that the best course of action was simply to try to find Mrs. Harris' son and have him brought to the police station as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.437" offset="1109758">Because Mrs. Harris refused to sit in a seat in the police station at the time, or was unable to... it's not clear exactly what the circumstances were... she was placed into a cell until her son was able to arrive within 20 to 30 minutes and to arrange for Mrs. Harris' release.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.735" offset="1398986">But there are two parts to the answer to your question, Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.547" offset="1410271">The first part is that their first reaction was to ask her whether she needed medical assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.379" offset="1429601">The second part of the answer was that there was testimony from the head jailer that if Mrs. Harris was likely to remain in the jail for much longer he was, he was at a point in time where he was thinking about sending her to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.898" offset="1479652">But he believed that her son would be coming almost immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.690" offset="1490832">So it wasn't even in this case a situation where somebody said, I'm going to completely ignore Mrs. Harris' condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.143" offset="1512671">They took into account the possibility of sending her to the hospital, and decided that under the regulation, and under the circumstances of the case, the better course of action was to allow her to remain there until her son was able to arrive.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.790" offset="2095201">The Sixth Circuit certainly did not hold that there was any kind of a custom in this case, and we would submit that there is certainly no evidence from which one could infer the existence of a custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.687" offset="2130832">Respondents' only evidence on the issue of custom is a single statement by a single police officer, not a policymaker, that he personally in situations of dealing with emotionally-disturbed would wait until the person appeared to be a threat to herself, him or herself, before he would be obliged to take that person to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.629" offset="2210558">That is the only evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.121" offset="2216514">There is no indication in the record of this case of anyone ever being denied medical care, either for emotional or medical or physical injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.617" offset="2250473">Indeed, the testimony of the chief of police in office in 1978 when the incident took place was that he had never even been, he had never received even a complaint about a failure to provide medical assistance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.595" offset="2306480">Under those circumstances, I don't think there's any basis frankly for saying that there is such a subtle custom of depriving people of medical care within the community, that it could be regarded as law for the City of Canton.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.617" offset="2738545">Therefore, I think the inference is inescapable that what the jury found was that this woman was in no way abused as a consequence of her actions, and a consequence of that particular arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.933" offset="2775743">At the end of the trial, after Mrs. Harris had sued her arresting officer, the officer who is the backup officer, the person who drove the patrol wagon, the assistant jailer, the head jailer, the chief of police, and the mayor of the city, and including the City of Canton itself, the jury rejected all of the findings against all of the defendants except for the one against the City of Canton.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.048" offset="2868217">And the one against the City of Canton involved exclusively the question of whether the city failed to provide her with adequate medical assistance during the period of her detention.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.298" offset="3473213">The only evidence they turn to was the evidence of the chief of police, although I should note that that was the chief of police in 1980 as opposed to 1978 when the events took place, but his evidence to the effect that they did not have additional training or any specific training with respect to emotional injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.180" offset="3540818">I inferred from that they are not really supporting particularly the specific basis of the Court, and I assumed that on the basis of what this Court said in Praprotnik that you cannot identify as an actionable policy under 1983 the decision to confer discretion upon employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.061" offset="3616259">So they've now gone in search of a new policy, and that policy they style as inadequate training.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.852" offset="4719462">It seems to me it's much more sensible to analyze the case across the generality of situations and to focus on the protection of the Constitutional rights themselves, rather than trying to make Section 1983 into a statute designed to provide uniform training for all municipalities and counties throughout the United States, which I think there's no evidence that 1983 was ever intended to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.582" offset="6102385">As a threshold matter, I wish to call this Court's attention to the fact that the issue that the city says is properly before this Court, as they say, a failure to train can never amount to a policy, as that term is defined in Monell, is not properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.420" offset="6173751">Not only did the city not appeal from the underlying judgment that there was a 14th amendment violation here in the sense that Mrs. Harris was denied a right to necessary medical care, and the record does support that judgment, but at trial, this case was tried on a simple negligence theory because the city pre-trial, in its pre-trial brief, and I've cited it at page nine of our brief, on the merits, conceded that if the Plaintiff proved that the actions of the city as the result of misfeasance and nonfeasance by failing to adequately train, supervise, or discipline members of the police offices, proximally caused the injury in this case, the city could be held properly liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.387" offset="6389627">I personally was not on the case at that point, but in the opposition to certiorari, and I will get to that point, even at the stage of opposition of certiorari, the city's submission on the certiorari petition was not that training can never amount to a policy under Monell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.358" offset="6457441">This question submitted, on which this Court granted cert, was whether or not Monell liability could be found where violations of Constitutional rights might foreseeably result from inadequate training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.368" offset="6513552">That is, in this petition for certiorari itself, the city reaffirmed the position it took in the trial court that negligence alone could be a basis for finding that a failure to train amounts to a policy under Monell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.207" offset="6576873">Not only did the city make that position clear pre-trial, and therefore this case was tried, and the evidence was produced, on a theory of simple negligence, but in the Court of Appeals, in its petition for rehearing before the Court of Appeals, the city stated, and we quoted the page 11 of our brief, in its petition for rehearing, the city says, the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.402" offset="6669660">"quite correctly, in our view, states that grossly inadequate training may be a basis for a city's liability under 42 Section U.S. 1983. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.681" offset="6714800">So that the position of the city consistently, pre-trial, on appeal in the Court of Appeals, in it's petition for certiorari to this Court, which is why we didn't make the response that would normally be called for under Tuttle, to point out to this Court that the issue is not properly before it, the city's consistent position is diametrically opposed to what it suggests to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.723" offset="6798914">Now, the two reasons this Court has traditionally given for not deciding issues which are not properly preserved below, both strongly counsel against this Court deciding this case on the submission of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.342" offset="6849382">Number one, you have the possibility... and we're not certainly accusing the city of doing it here... of preserving an issue for appeal by suggesting an erroneous legal standard at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.546" offset="6882192">They say at trial mere inevidence is sufficient, and now they say both the trial court and the Court of Appeals were wrong for adopting that position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.327" offset="6941333">As I said to Justice White, the opposition, which I did not file, I did not become part of this case until the brief on the merits, that point was not made in the opposition brief, but it was not made, as in Kibbe, the same reason, because the brief for certiorari, the petition for certiorari, itself expressed this issue in terms of inadequate training, which was the same position as taken by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.703" offset="7038822">Secondly, the city now says that we didn't adduce sufficient proof to meet the standard they suggest of, as best I can tell its intentionality, its, we don't state a claim under Monell unless we show that the failure to train was done with the intent to violate citizens' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.215" offset="7108935">The city now says that we haven't adduced enough proof, if that's the proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.628" offset="7126594">Well, of course we haven't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.158" offset="7132654">We think the proof could meet that standard, but this case was tried under a simple negligence theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.031" offset="7152194">There was no burden on the Plaintiff at trial, given the very position of the city, to adduce proof that would meet deliberate indifference or intentionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.498" offset="7186049">And so both issues that are supposedly before this Court, number one, the question of what standard applies under a failure to train, and the question, the underlying question... because a new trial has already been granted in this case, the city will have another chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.204" offset="7236831">The question of whether there was sufficient proof to meet whatever standard this Court would announce controls the question of failure to train, the Plaintiff didn't have a proper opportunity to provide that proof, because we tried it under the theory that the city made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.024" offset="7296181">In Tuttle, as Justice White's question suggests, this Court said, properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.408" offset="7321676">The Respondent ought to point out to this Court where an issue has not been properly preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.863" offset="7339544">I've explained why we didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.484" offset="7349993">This is the fourth time in as many years that this Court has taken a case concerning municipal liability on a city's petition where there have been substantial questions over whether the issue was properly preserved in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.312" offset="7401298">Tuttle, Praprotnik, Kibbe, and now this case, and indeed Newport, the City of Newport case, had the same problem as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.469" offset="7433898">It's one thing to say to the Respondent, you should point it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.740" offset="7447064">Here we didn't because it wasn't properly posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.851" offset="7455423">We think as a corollary to the Tuttle rule a petitioner as an officer of this Court ought to at least in its petition for certiorari point out what might be arguable grounds, and here they were abundant, as to why the issue was not properly preserved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.888" offset="10695652">And it certainly is not counter-intuitive to suggest that one who is not properly trained, who receives no instructions that you cannot use lethal force against a fleeing pickpocket, is not as readily going to cause or commit a violation of Constitutional rights than the very policy in Garner, which this Court condemned, which just permitted the use of deadly force in that kind of situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.390" offset="11277660">Gross negligence meets the fault standard, and indeed when you think about the notion of causation, you can have causation whether or not you have fault.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.394" offset="11353624">But we recognize that fault is a component of Monell, and indeed as Justice O'Connor noted in her opinion in dissent, in the Kibbe case, she would require some higher level of culpability to ensure that there was in fact causation, that a jury's not speculating.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.112" offset="13664520">I still don't think I've heard him defend that standard, and all I'm saying is that under any standard there's no basis for going back for a trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.326" offset="13693360">Because if you examine the custom, or excuse me, the policy issue in this case, there's one, no issue that any policymaker ever, ever made a decision with respect to the adequacy of training in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.535" offset="13738186">The chief of police that he cites was the chief of police in 1980, not in 1978 when the events took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.479" offset="13765980">Second of all, there's no deliberate choice among alternatives in this case, because there's no evidence whatsoever of what alternative levels of training could possibly have been adequate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.814" offset="13803283">And finally, there is no evidence on the issue of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.197" offset="13816867">There's not a single expert testify as to what level of training would have been satisfactory to stop Mrs. Harris from suffering the injuries she suffered, and I submit to you that a physician in this particular case could well have made exactly the same mistake that the officers made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.488" offset="13877993">One last point on the issue of custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.819" offset="13887293">Counsel cites the testimony of Mr. Norsia and says it was uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.273" offset="13905160">The testimony he cites from the captain, the ship's commander on the issue, was, what things are done with a very emotional hysterical type person, Captain Maxson stated, they generally cool off on their own, but if the situation persists we take them to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.380" offset="13965556">I submit there's no evidence in this case of a custom of violating Constitutional rights, and therefore the judgment below should be set aside.</text>
