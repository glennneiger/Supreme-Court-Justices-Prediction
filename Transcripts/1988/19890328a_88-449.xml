            <text syncTime="47.083" offset="336502">Also, under another provision of Connecticut law, brewers are free to change or lower their prices at any time elsewhere, and such a change or decrease in price does not constitute a violation of Connecticut law.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.162" offset="384776">The law is challenged under the Commerce Clause, and three issues emerge: one, whether it contains an impermissible extraterritorial thrust and thus directly regulates commerce in other states; second, whether it constitutes protectionist legislation by neutralizing the competitive advantages in other states; and third, whether it is an indirect burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.217" offset="481011">We submit that the law passes muster under all three Commerce Clause tests and to whatever effect it has on interstate commerce, it is sanctioned by the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.119" offset="544645">In that case, this Court struck down New York's affirmation law because it prevented brewers from lowering their prices in other states lower than that which was in effect in New York at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.325" offset="589471">The Court noted that that constituted an impermissible extraterritorial effect because it, in effect, regulated prices in other states in violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.881" offset="631685">Connecticut's law was struck down in 1982 for this same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.246" offset="649135">And it was amended in 1984 with precisely this defect in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.997" offset="668152">Today under Connecticut law, brewers are free to change their prices in other states at any time, and that price change does not constitute a violation of Connecticut law.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.584" offset="706500">Brewers, however, contend that they do not have the pricing flexibility that the Connecticut statute purports to extend.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.890" offset="735757">New York, they argue, has a 180-day price hold on price reductions, and Massachusetts has a 30-day price hold on all prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.116" offset="772642">The Second Circuit agreed and found that there... since there was no difference between what, in effect, occurred prior to the amendment, that even with the amendment, the law still contains an impermissible extraterritorial thrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.084" offset="832515">We respectfully submit that it should be clear that Connecticut has no control over the pricing laws in New York or Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.001" offset="864175">Connecticut allows brewers to change their prices at any time and it does not constitute a violation of Connecticut law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Ives Glekel</label>
            <text syncTime="1711.746" offset="6995114">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.377" offset="7061674">As the Appellants concede, Connecticut's beer affirmation provisions were enacted by the Connecticut legislature in order to halt the practice of Connecticut consumers who live near the border areas crossing state lines to buy beer in the bordering states at the lower prices which prevailed in those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.542" offset="7150281">It is our position that the Connecticut law violates the Commerce Clause on two different though somewhat related grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.236" offset="7181106">First, the statute is extraterritorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.458" offset="7193958">It's extraterritorial because it purposefully regulates transactions occurring in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.755" offset="7223215">Second, in our view--</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.875" offset="7231679">When you say purposefully regulates, Mr. Glekel, you put to one side, I take it, cases in which a local law will have an effect, although it's not designed to have that effect in another state.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Ives Glekel</label>
            <text syncTime="1783.524" offset="7282252">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.285" offset="7285282">I put aside the cases where a state law designed to promote some valid objective does have some ramifications on commerce in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.642" offset="7326764">It is our view that the law is also protectionist because it operates much in the manner of a tariff or a tax to deprive out-of-state consumers and wholesalers of the competitive advantages which they presently enjoy in the actions of such legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.405" offset="7405759">I should also add that it is our view that affirmation statutes in general... that is, state laws that tie in-state prices to out-of-state prices... are generally extraterritorial and protectionist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.005" offset="7468139">We believe there is some factors that attend... attending the operation of the Connecticut statute that make it particularly objectionable on Commerce Clause grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.122" offset="7512652">But it is our broader submission that the logic of this Court's Commerce Clause decisions compel the conclusion that affirmation statutes are generally unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.020" offset="7560195">I would like to first briefly address the extraterritorial operation of the Connecticut statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.807" offset="7591437">This, of course, was the basis for the Second Circuit's decision invalidating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.339" offset="7609514">I think it is useful to focus for just a moment on the manner in which the statute came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.564" offset="7638458">In 1983, this Court summarily affirmed the Second Circuit's decision which invalidated Connecticut's predecessor statute on the grounds that it prohibited brewers from selling beer in a neighboring state at a price lower than the posted Connecticut price during the month covered by the posting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.515" offset="7714213">The Connecticut legislature then amended the affirmation requirement to require that at the time of the posting the prices at which beer was sold in the bordering states was no higher than the posted Connecticut price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.929" offset="7783907">It was still illegal, however, under the statutory language for the brewers to lower prices in the bordering states subsequent to their Connecticut posting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.624" offset="7826644">Now, when the brewers brought suit again seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, Connecticut apparently recognized that this statute was just as unconstitutional as the one invalidated in the previous Healy decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.764" offset="7883173">The Connecticut liquor commissioners attempted to step into the breach, and they issued a declaratory ruling which basically states that despite the statutory language, under Connecticut law it is not illegal for a brewer to lower its price in the bordering states following its posting an affirmation in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.689" offset="7970944">Now, as I understand it, Connecticut's argument seems to be that the brewers really have nothing to complain about because under Connecticut law all they have to do is to adjust their prices to neighboring state prices... that is, to adjust their Connecticut price to neighboring state price levels... for the single day of the posting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.483" offset="8054118">I think the problem is, as Mr. Vacchelli acknowledged... is that the brewers cannot, in fact, lower it at lower bordering state prices subsequent to their posting an affirmation in the bordering states because Connecticut law interacts with the statutes of the bordering states in a way which makes this impossible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.036" offset="8480332">That is a permissible purpose under the Twenty-first Amendment, but I think that this Court's precedents establish that even if the purpose is permissible, a state cannot attempt to achieve that purpose by protectionist or extraterritorial means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.928" offset="8547832">And our objection would be to the means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.170" offset="8560789">It would be somewhat similar to this... to the Bacchus Imports case where the Court ruled that a tax which Hawaii... a tax exemption which Hawaii granted just to home-grown liquor and not to other liquor was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.903" offset="8643754">I think the... the problem with that is that there are plenty of things that Connecticut can do in order to promote temperance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.481" offset="8678131">Obviously, they could prohibit the sale of beer altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.684" offset="12226918">Part of the problem is that there's less competition in Connecticut because of its increased regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.158" offset="12336841">And this is something that constantly changes particularly because of a lack of restrictions in the New York market where different wholesalers receive different prices at different times.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.379" offset="12853648">At some point... whether by bargaining in this nature at some point you're doing the exact, same thing as you're doing in affirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.675" offset="12890846">I think if a state had a hard and fast policy that, in fact, made a brewer sign an affirmation that it would never offer prices any... to a state any higher than those sold anywhere else, there would be substantial question whether that would be immunized from Commerce Clause challenge because it was the state doing it itself rather than compelling private parties... private parties to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.382" offset="12985723">I would like to turn briefly to our contention that affirmation statutes are generally unconstitutional and that Seagram should be overruled or at least substantially qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.051" offset="13040371">We do not believe that there is any principal distinction between prospective, contemporaneous and retrospective affirmation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.736" offset="13075062">In our view, all type of affirmation laws are protectionist and exercise impermissible extraterritorial control because what they do is to force brewers to consider the affirmation state's market conditions when they are setting prices in other states on the basis of market conditions in those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.640" offset="13158758">In short, any law that compels brewers to sell their product in an affirmation state at prices no higher than those offered in other states, inevitably is going to deprive brewers and consumers and retailers of the relative advantages that they would enjoy without such legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.681" offset="13234931">Now, I want to make it clear that we are not contesting the right of a state, Connecticut or any other state, to set maximum prices for liquor, beer or any other commodity if it feels that's a wise sort of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.251" offset="13289161">What we believe a state may not do, however, is in order to achieve lower prices within its border, to impose burdens on businesses and consumers in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.138" offset="13332733">And this is what affirmation statutes of any kind really do because under affirmation, a brewer is no longer free to set prices in out-of-state markets on the basis of conditions prevailing in those markets in order to maximize their profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.849" offset="13395532">What the brewer is compelled to do is to consider that the lowest price it charges in out-of-state markets must be offered throughout the affirmation state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.114" offset="13436596">And I think the inevitable result will be that a brewer or distiller will to some extent modify their out-of-state prices that they would otherwise charge in order to satisfy the requirements of affirmation.</text>
