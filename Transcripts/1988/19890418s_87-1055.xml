            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.324" offset="123753">This case is here on certiorari to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.568" offset="144756">It involves wrongful death actions against-- one of its planes was destroyed by Soviet aircraft over the Sea of Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.923" offset="174222">All parties agreed that their rights are governed by the multilateral treaty known as the Warsaw Convention, which provides a per passenger damages limitation for personal injury or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.260" offset="223541">The convention provides that passenger tickets must include notice of this limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.502" offset="244544">The private accord among airlines known as the Montreal Agreement, prescribes that this notice shall be in print size no smaller than 10-point type.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.633" offset="285086">Korea Airlines' notice to its passengers on the flight in question here appeared in only 8-point type.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.176" offset="315179">This case required us to decide whether this discrepancy deprived KAL of the benefit of the damages limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.692" offset="345272">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and incidentally agree with the Supreme Court of Canada in holding that international air carriers do not loose the benefit of the Warsaw Convention's damages limitation if they fail to provide notice of that limitation and passenger tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.059" offset="426774">Montreal Agreement concededly does no impose such a sanction and such a result is contrary to the convention's plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.063" offset="458748">Drafting history of the convention maybe consulted to clarify a text that is ambiguous but where the text is clear as the Warsaw Convention is on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.895" offset="502111">We have no power to insert an amendment into what the signatories have formally adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.067" offset="522800">Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens joined.</text>
