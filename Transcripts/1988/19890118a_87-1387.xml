            <text syncTime="80.594" offset="462786">And that is, whether comparative statistics, which show only a racial imbalance in the work force are to be preferred as a matter of law, over the trial court findings of fact as to the relevant labor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.755" offset="527361">There is a stark contrast between these two measurements.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.366" offset="597891">It is explicitly adopted by the very EEOC guidelines which are relied upon by the Respondents in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.071" offset="636657">Indeed, it is ironic that in order to prevail in this case, the Respondents, and the amicus supporting them, are urging this Court, to urge as a matter of law that one of the most formidable tools that we have to measure employment discrimination, namely the labor market analysis, is to be discarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2739.608" offset="11098802">Non-whites are recruited from largely non-white sources, such as Alaskan native villages, and through foremen of Asian descent, and at Local 37, which is a union with a large Filipino membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.127" offset="11156899">It is undisputed that those who hire for the low-paying, menial jobs, that these primarily non-white sources have no authority to discuss, in any way, shape or form, the possibility of employment in another upper-level job with potential candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.489" offset="11234326">We have talked a little bit about the fact that there are Alaskan natives recruited from coastal villages who, at least would appear to have significant skills, for the tender and the fishing jobs, that they are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.729" offset="11295348">At the same time, we have whites, often who are related to people in management, who are as young as 14 years old, 15 years old, 16 years old and so on, who are employed in the upper-level jobs, the better-paying jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.131" offset="11360863">Mr. Fryer discussed at length the effect of Local 37 on hiring... the effect of Local 37 on the labor market and on hiring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.399" offset="11406002">We would ask simply that the Court read the provisions of the Local 37 agreement, because the Local 37 agreement vests management with full authority to hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.734" offset="11455322">There are three preferences and the preferences are the only provisions in the labor contract that address hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.241" offset="11485310">The third preference, which is the last preference, goes to those individuals who are acceptable to management.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.105" offset="11516762">The other two preferences simply perpetuate the past management choices, by saying that individuals who worked at the same cannery are entitled to first preference on a rehired basis; individuals who worked for the same company at another cannery are entitled to second preference on a rehire basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.283" offset="12113503">Going further to the issue of Local 37 involvement in the hiring process, again, I would ask the Court to note the fact that the collective bargaining agreement does not provide for a hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.264" offset="12181421">This is not the situation that we often see in the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.067" offset="12200647">It is a situation in which the collective bargaining agreement reserves to management full hiring discretion and authority and management, even if it gets a referral, has every right on earth to simply reject that referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.428" offset="12266058">I would like to address Mr. Fryer's comment that the district court found that there was no deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.148" offset="12328961">In fact, the district court made contradictory findings on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.630" offset="12342858">When the district court discussed individual instances of discrimination, made express findings that particular individuals did not seek upper-level jobs because of the segregation in jobs, messing and housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.528" offset="12390505">Also on the question of whether there were, in fact, 24 percent non-whites in the at issue jobs, I don't believe that a reading of even the employer statistics bears that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.884" offset="12435958">What the employer did was include some jobs that are not at-issue, such as, laborer jobs, and I would refer the Court to our Appendices A and B, in which we set out both our own statistics on a department-by-department basis and the employer's statistics on a department-by-department basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.799" offset="12515579">And they show a high degree of racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.320" offset="12529686">Because of the wide geographical area from which people are hired, and because of what appears to be a prevalence of favoritism, particularly in the nepotism area, it is often unrealistic to expect a non-white from one remote area, such as Wapata, Washington, or Bristol Bay, Alaska, to make contact with the tender captain, whose recommendation is the most influential, or the machinist foreman, who, as a practical matter, may make the hiring decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.658" offset="12699064">Given the far-flung labor market area, from which the employer hires, the effect of the separate hiring channels is really aggravated to an extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.415" offset="12746084">By the time that the cannery workers arrive at the cannery, the upper-level jobs are already filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.740" offset="12771371">The employer articulated in its brief, and at trial, a policy of discouraging transfers from the heavily non-white cannery worker jobs to the upper-level jobs during the season.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.419" offset="12822048">So cannery workers are locked in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.262" offset="12833437">And the employer also, at a time when the cannery workers have the easiest access to the employer... namely while they are at the cannery... might listen to a request for a better job, but will not consider that an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.180" offset="12893101">Seeing that I am close to the end of my time here, there are a number of practices... there are seven in all... that we challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.415" offset="12926015">They have produced a work force that is racially stratified, and a work force which has jobs which even the employer expressly labels by race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.954" offset="12972200">The employer, in its company records, and in conversation among management officials, refer to Filipino jobs, or Filipino cannery worker jobs, to the native-crew, to the Filipino bunkhouse, to the white mess house and all of those are amply documented in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.947" offset="13048164">The phrase that the Court of Appeals used in discussing this practice was that it was pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.158" offset="13073033">This is a case of the sort that we would have expected to see more reasonably in the late '60s or the early '70s, at the dawn of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.938" offset="13124128">It is, in fact, a case that was filed in the early '70s, in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.100" offset="13144817">The record, we believe, makes a very strong showing of the disparate impact of each of these separate practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.757" offset="13183374">Despite this, the employers never really offered evidence that would constitute, in any way, a business necessity, although there is one finding on business necessity that the district court made and that the court of appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.410" offset="13250038">Generally, the employer's evidence was not geared toward making the type of showing that this Court has recognized as justifying a disparate impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.654" offset="13575002">They said that we had to prove business necessity based solely on the Plaintiff's comparative statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.677" offset="13603109">A couple of things I would like to run over, the respondent's, Mr. Arditi, argued for his labor market theory based upon the history in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.436" offset="13646159">That was specifically rejected... rejected by the trial court in findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.438" offset="13662146">Cannery workers are never locked into any of these jobs; they are free to apply at the end of the season and they have seven months to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.344" offset="13693806">And the district court found that they were treated equally and everyone was free to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.007" offset="13716376">Contrary to Mr. Arditi's statement, the trial court expressly found that he could find no deterrence on this record, although some of those that testified, testified that they felt they were deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.875" offset="13763919">In summary, I would urge you to consider that this employer, who has hired more than the available percentage of minorities in the at-issue jobs, should not be penalized simply because he has employed even more in another job classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.978" offset="13844272">Further, when you get to the standard of proof here, and what we must examine the employer's practices by, I would urge the Court to look at the practices the employer actually did use, not the practices the Respondents, or the court of appeals, contend he should have used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.223" offset="13933297">That is simply speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.044" offset="13940611">Look at this employer as to how he did, in fact, employ minorities in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.668" offset="13967047">Finally, on the multiple practice challenge, which I really didn't address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.394" offset="14005917">In a nutshell, our position on that is, if the employees, if the plaintiffs challenge an employer's practices, under the impact analysis by challenging the bottom line of the total effect, of all of the employer's practices; or if they challenge several practices, their burden is still to prove causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.839" offset="14099749">It is implicit here that the plaintiffs could not prove causation; that is why they have got difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.043" offset="14124513">That is why they go to the employer and say, okay, Mr. Employer, you explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.878" offset="14143844">But that is not how we try civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.188" offset="14157114">The plaintiff has simply got to prove his case; it is his theory, it is case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.542" offset="14174564">Under the discovery standards, the information may be possessed by the employer, but it is equally available to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.316" offset="14205597">In conclusion, I would urge that this Court vacate the decision of the court of appeals and remand for entry of judgment in accordance with the trial court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.515" offset="14258469">Thank you.</text>
