            <text syncTime="13.751" offset="169010">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.223" offset="182907">The narrow issue presented by this case is whether a court of appeals may permit amendment of the complaint to drop a nondiverse defendant and thereby perfect diversity jurisdiction so that the court may go on to decide the merits of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.615" offset="260438">The court below held that it had no such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.277" offset="275067">The courts of appeals for the Second, Third, Fifth, Ninth and District of Columbia Circuits have held to the contrary and, in fact, no court since 1942, which was the Seventh Circuit again, has held that it did not have such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.291" offset="355210">It is a narrow issue, but perhaps the broader significance of it is that it raises a question whether the powers of the courts of appeals, so far as possible, should be conducted in a way... should be construed in a way that permits the just, speedy and inexpensive termination of controversies as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure admonish.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.528" offset="456148">The case arises from a suit brought by the Plaintiff, Petitioner here, the Newman-Green Company, to enforce certain individual guarantee agreements of individuals in Venezuela which guaranteed royalty payments due from a Venezuelan corporation under a license agreement with the Plaintiff corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.095" offset="562414">The Plaintiff... the complaint alleged that the five individual Defendants, that four of them were residents and citizens of Venezuela, and that the fifth-named Defendant, one Bettison, was a citizen of the United States, resident in Caracas, Venezuela, and the complaint alleged jurisdiction based on Section 1332 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.669" offset="704624">The... no objection to the jurisdiction of the court, of the district court, was made by the Defendants at any time, although they did, oddly enough, move to quash service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.880" offset="773483">That was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.713" offset="780797">The case was litigated in the district court for about four-and-a-half years, and you can get some idea of the extensiveness of the... of the litigation and how controverted it was by scanning the docket entries which are reproduced in the... in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.925" offset="861672">At length after four-and-a-half years, during which time the district court had rendered several opinions, the district court rendered summary judgment which disposed of all of the claims against the five individual Defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.684" offset="924784">The Venezuelan Corporation itself had intervened in the meantime and had certain counterclaims pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.311" offset="955191">The district court gave judgment in part for the Plaintiff, and that judgment was eventually satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.086" offset="990299">No appeal was taken from it, but in important aspects gave judgment, summary judgment for the Defendants and entered a Rule 54(b) certification, upon which appeal was taken to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.585" offset="1044321">When counsel for the Appellant rose to make his argument, a judge of the Seventh Circuit said,</text>
            <text syncTime="241.872" offset="1081519">"Do we have jurisdiction of the case? "</text>
            <text syncTime="243.915" offset="1089669">And it was then and only at that time that anyone realized that in fact, under Section 1332, there was no diversity jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.968" offset="1581816">And indeed, it perhaps bears noting, that the opinion of Judge Posner suggested that the district court might choose to exercise its discretion by saying six years is long enough, and out you go, rather than merely addressing whether they... whether the other side had been somehow prejudiced by the inclusion of Bettison as a Defendant during that period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.599" offset="6620419">And that is that what is involved in this case involves somehow changing the facts as they existed when the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.446" offset="6651766">We have... we do not... we do not question the general position that jurisdiction in a federal court is determined by the facts as of the date the case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.404" offset="6699622">No facts are being changed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.366" offset="6707459">It's not as though you were trying to show that Mr. Bettison had become a citizen of a state, even though he was not at the time the action was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.235" offset="6750926">All that's being changed here is a... is a pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.848" offset="6765346">It is dropping an allegation which defeats federal jurisdiction, and Section 1653, on its face, is designed to permit the changing of pleadings, not the changing of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.739" offset="6820935">This is not the changing of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.131" offset="6826472">I think the other thing that I would... and, of course, to... to call that into question is to call into question the massive body of precedent that goes all the way back to 1825 and has been continuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.900" offset="6885614">We've set forth on... on I think two or three pages of our reply brief the cases, and they're only part of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.698" offset="6920827">And even though Judge Posner in his opinion toward the end of it, seemed to express some discomfort with that thought, the cases are there, and I submit that you really can't reconcile those cases with what's really the fundamental premise of Judge Posner's opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.558" offset="7084249">And it's really what makes me think that the kind of admonitory purpose of Judge Posner's opinion, which seems to me to be a kind of dunce cap theory of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.248" offset="7130956">Go back to the district court, and that's wearing the dunce cap, and everybody will see and be wiser from there on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.202" offset="7154779">If they were not successful in imparting this wisdom when it was part of their function to do so, I'm a little skeptical that this opinion will have all that... all that effect.</text>

I should throw in here in view of the string of University of Chicago people you've mentioned who were associated with this is... the only explanation I was able to get why my younger and brighter colleagues who were participants in this error was one of them said yes, he took federal jurisdiction at the University of Chicago, but it was taught that year by a visiting professor from Harvard, and they didn't deal with diversity jurisdiction.</text>
