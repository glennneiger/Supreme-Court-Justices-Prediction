            <text syncTime="11.710" offset="186474">General Clark, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="j_steven_clark" startTime="73.500" stopTime="204.606">
            <label>Mr. J. Steven Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="73.500" offset="433593">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the State of Arkansas believes the facts in this case are somewhat simple in that simply what occurred here in our trial courts in Union County was trial error rather than a failure to submit sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.933" offset="519379">In 1980 the defendant, Johnny Lee Nelson, was charged with burglary, breaking and entering, and misdemeanor theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.497" offset="545606">In 1982 he pled guilty to that same charge and agreed to be sentenced by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.561" offset="569847">Because of the defendant's previous prior convictions my state chose to sentence him as an habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.885" offset="595134">The state introduced four prior convictions, one of which included a conviction of assault with intent to rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.771" offset="622719">The jury, after hearing the evidence, sentenced the defendant to 20 years as an habitual offender, the minimum sentence under our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.425" offset="653335">The sentence was subsequently upheld by the Arkansas Court of Appeals and by the Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.010" offset="679666">In 1985 Mr. Nelson filed a habeas petition alleging that one of the four convictions upon which the state relied had been pardoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.857" offset="711013">The United States District Court asked my office to in fact investigate that fact and we did, and learned that there had been a pardon on the conviction of assault with intent to rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.512" offset="753645">The District Court then issued an opinion which held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment applied to the State of Arkansas and would bar us from resentencing Mr. Nelson as an habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.048" offset="795754">The Eight Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.070" offset="807875">In that order from the District Court and from the Eighth Circuit the State of Arkansas was advised that in fact we either had to retry Mr. Nelson as a burglar, sentencing him to three to twenty years, or to let him go within 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.391" offset="861165">The state concedes that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to the sentencing phase of our trial procedure in the instance that that procedure is one in which the state has a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, one in which the state may offer witnesses and the defendant has an opportunity to confront those and cross-examine and offer other testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.461" offset="933472">And so in that instance Bullington standard, as articulated by this Court, we submit and concede applies to that procedure.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="204.606" offset="958027">This is because of the multiple offender aspect?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_steven_clark" startTime="207.808" stopTime="272.741">
            <label>Mr. J. Steven Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="207.808" offset="970879">Yes, your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.108" offset="975999">Under our state statute if you are sentenced as an habitual offender, you must give the defendant notice of that but not notice of the prior conviction upon which the state will rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.494" offset="1005570">So, Mr. Nelson knew that we were going to sentence his, or attempt to sentence him, as an habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.235" offset="1020512">Yet, I further submit and contend that the District Court in its decision found this case to be like that of a Burks decision of this Court when in fact this case can be distinguished from a Burks decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.373" offset="1065129">This is not a decision like Burks in which there is an insufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.275" offset="1080698">This is a case in which we had trial error that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.948" offset="1095431">That distinction is really based on this analogy, I would offer to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.561" offset="1109851">The burden pushed upon the State of Arkansas was to fill a basket, a basket full of apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.862" offset="1127092">That was four prior convictions to trigger the Habitual Offender Act in order to let the Jury consider the evidence and determine if in fact the state had made its burden beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.282" offset="1172754">We attempted to do just that and believed that we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.462" offset="1185501">We did that in the instance offering four prior felony convictions from the court records.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.506" offset="1205668">These were certified copies of commitment orders from the Union County Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.048" offset="1223849">When we offered those--</text>

            <text syncTime="272.741" offset="1230536">Attorney General Clark, couldn't one argue... I don't know if it would be a correct argument... that one of your four apples really wasn't an apple?</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="281.677" stopTime="283.527">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="281.677" offset="1266272">And that therefore it's really a Burks case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_steven_clark" startTime="283.527" stopTime="333.289">
            <label>Mr. J. Steven Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="283.527" offset="1273691">Yes, your Honor, one could argue that clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.637" offset="1282154">I think the distinction to be drawn in this case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.149" offset="1292185">It is that at the time that we offered those four prior convictions, as you will recall from the record, there was no objection, you recall there was some discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.086" offset="1323950">The defendant himself made some reference to the fact that he believed he had been pardoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.317" offset="1340878">Yet, he also made some comment to the fact that he believed his sentence had been commuted to a term of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.850" offset="1363030">I submit to this Court that the better reason rule of law is two here in this instance and distinguishes this from Burks.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.915" offset="1383301">One, that the state, I believe, should have the right to rely upon the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.818" offset="1398870">The trial judge, after hearing the statements of the defendant and looking at the evidence as offered as being competent to represent the facts for which it was offered, let it be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.823" offset="1434919">Secondly, in our process which is a bifurcated process, the jury had the opportunity to consider that evidence as it was introduced, as to its competency.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.090" offset="1467937">The jury had--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="333.289" offset="1472744">Well, in fact here, I think that decision was to be made by the judge, but under a mistake he referred it to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.156" offset="1508270">--Yes, your Honor, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.578" offset="1513913">The Arkansas Legislature had amended our law in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.520" offset="1525720">This trial proceeding occurred in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.200" offset="1536378">The trial judge did make error.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.021" offset="1543692">He gave the four convictions to the jury for the purpose of them determining their validity as competent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.405" offset="1569188">But the jury, as I suggested, made a decision which distinguished this case from Burks in the instance that they heard the evidence; the statement of the defendant, the comments of prosecutor, the comments of the trial judge, and the statement of the defendant that in fact his sentence had been commuted to a term of years, and comments by his defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.685" offset="1634390">Weighing all of that, the jury determined these were four competent convictions upon which they could believe or accept... and in this instance did believe and accept... and weighed them to believe that the state had met its burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.039" offset="5959745">I would further argue to this Court that in terms of the standard that Arkansas request that you articulate is one that presents for my state a clear answer to a problem that we are now facing in the sense that I have been asked from time to time why we didn't just go back and resentence this person and then if it be challenged in terms of double jeopardy, produce this case to this Court in a different fashion than presently offered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.442" offset="6109374">I submit to you that the better reason rule of law lets us have that opportunity because what occurred here was we met our sufficiency standard, we filled up that barrel with apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.589" offset="6145945">We learned after, and much like a motion for newly-discovered evidence in terms of setting aside the procedure that one of those apples was an orange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.525" offset="6181681">And because of that, we should have an opportunity to retry this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.145" offset="6548231">Mr. Nelson had to have a belated appeal granted by the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.996" offset="6563591">Let me give you the chronology in this case because the chronology is important to how it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.521" offset="6589714">He was charged first in early 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.882" offset="6599118">His case number is CR-79-22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.254" offset="6612597">He was convicted before a jury on the first trial and got 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.658" offset="6630256">This was in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.188" offset="6636316">That conviction was reversed because the prosecuting attorney withheld discoverable material and the case was sent back for retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.134" offset="6664110">It was reversed in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.624" offset="6670066">When it came back in 1982, Mr. Nelson pled guilty and asked to have the sentence in question submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.049" offset="6699846">And that's where the pardon prior conviction first came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.400" offset="6709250">Now, there were three convictions from 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.292" offset="6720744">The state only chose to use one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.784" offset="6730775">Another conviction, Number 90-90 that's in our footnote 1, may be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.329" offset="6756897">It was a pre-Gideon conviction that does not apparently show counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.569" offset="6765883">That's probably why the state didn't offer it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.691" offset="6778422">The one that was used here, Number 9078, did in fact show counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.544" offset="6793782">The other conviction, Number 9065, the earlier conviction... I don't recall now whether that one shows counsel or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.091" offset="6823980">I think it was from a guilty plea; it probably does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.301" offset="6832861">And one of the other convictions the state did in fact used that's never been challenged before and is waiting for when this case comes back, CR 74-137, also used... it's just a printed form that says he appeared with his attorney with no name mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.531" offset="6889704">That conviction itself may be invalid under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.934" offset="6903392">Anyway, the case was submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.066" offset="6915826">The jury came out and found him guilty... of course, because he pled guilty... and sentenced him to 20 years at a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.538" offset="6937769">Now, one of the... there is a problem in my brief, an inconsistent statement of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.101" offset="6956055">I want to clarify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.232" offset="6960548">At page 12 I talk about their being lessers submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.895" offset="6975176">In fact, no lessers were submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.747" offset="6986566">It was submitted as four priors or not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.828" offset="6994925">And that's kind of incongruous because he did in fact plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.820" offset="7006941">So, the jury had to find four priors or let him go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.293" offset="7020734">Anyway, after the conviction no appeal was lodged by his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.456" offset="7041423">He wrote a pro se petition to the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.475" offset="7049469">They granted a belated appeal in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.227" offset="7060545">The case goes to the Arkansas Court of Appeals in 1984 and in that court Mr. Nelson's counsel, another appointed counsel, says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.012" offset="7095653">"He was pardoned in this case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.125" offset="7104117">And the state's response was,</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.755" offset="7110595">"He just said he was pardoned. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.669" offset="7134314">"That's not good enough. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.367" offset="7121044">"He said a trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.379" offset="7125119">"I though it was pardoned. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.488" offset="7129612">"But they didn't put in a document. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.781" offset="7138703">"He conceded at trial that it was reduced time served. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.863" offset="7151033">"Therefore, that's not good enough. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.113" offset="7156048">So, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed... or, Court of Appeals affirms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.126" offset="7172140">This time pro se he seeks post-conviction relief and he writes a handwritten petition to the Arkansas Supreme Court raising the same Issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.460" offset="7201501">That he was pardoned on that prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.963" offset="7207457">The State of Arkansas says, he just alleged it, that's not good enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.905" offset="7219265">Now, all this time nobody bothered to call the Secretary of State because this conviction was a matter of judicial notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.369" offset="7245074">It could have gone in with the pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.149" offset="7252179">It could have gone in by judicial notice under Arkansas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.860" offset="7263046">But nobody made an effort to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.733" offset="7270569">His own counsel didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.606" offset="9478021">He has one post-conviction petition which he filed, and he did it himself so it wasn't very artfully drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.821" offset="9502889">It wasn't backed up with the pardon like it should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.024" offset="9511666">He's out of state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.033" offset="9515741">His only remedy is to go to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.036" offset="9523787">And in federal court finally he started the process himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.658" offset="9538207">He filed the handwritten petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.258" offset="9544685">The state produced the pardon on request, and that's the first time he had counsel appointed, was after the pardon was produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.563" offset="9569867">And that's the first time the double jeopardy issue arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.235" offset="9580525">The background of the question making the record, the state's authorities that they cite, page 5 of the Reply Brief, talk about proffered evidence and that's exactly what we talk about in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.995" offset="9647607">But if the evidence is there, it's alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.248" offset="9656594">It's proffered to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.528" offset="9661714">Then on appeal, the court can refer to it even though it's not in the record because proffered evidence forms the basis of many appeals under Rule 103 of the Rules of Evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.562" offset="9693896">And, of course, the Arkansas State Rule is the Uniform Rules, which is almost identical to the Federal Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.958" offset="9715421">And, if there was no evidence referred to in the record, then of course you can't rely on it and you can't speculate as to whatever other evidence there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.923" offset="9747291">Several of the appellate courts, the Federal Appeals Court say we can't speculate as to what there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.305" offset="9768816">Well, they shouldn't speculate as to what there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.358" offset="9777070">If there's been no reference to it, then it can't be relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.927" offset="9787310">It is also possible, and I thought about this in preparation to the argument that the Court may concern itself with DeFrancesco because that dealt with a post-conviction sentencing proceeding where the defendant claimed double jeopardy prevented a resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.913" offset="9867245">DeFrancesco dealt with a federal statute that dealt with a federal right to appeal the sentence when the federal government decides it didn't like the length of a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.627" offset="9906115">Here, in Arkansas, there is no right to appeal a jury sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.860" offset="9919072">Neither side can appeal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.232" offset="9924505">It's possible that you could do it on post-conviction relief through proportionality review, but then you'd have to put on proof and establish the proportionality review, but then you'd have to put on proof and establish the proportionality question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.588" offset="9961913">Proof of enhancement factors in DeFrancesco was by a preponderance of the evidence tried separately to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.842" offset="9983020">In this particular case, it's proof beyond a reasonable doubt tried to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2465.492" offset="10001619">Well, it should have been tried to the judge, I guess.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.424" offset="10013322">Well, that's not necessarily a clear question either, if it goes whether this is procedural or substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.549" offset="10033802">The crime was in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.851" offset="10042997">The statute was changed in '81.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.410" offset="10049266">The first trial was in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.143" offset="10056163">And if the judge were operating under what benefits accrued the defendant under the pretrial or the prior trial, then he would give him the benefit of the 1980 version of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.719" offset="10098481">So, while Judge Lay and the court of appeals referred to the fact that the trial court might have acted erroneously, it's not really clear that the trial court did act erroneously in how it was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.017" offset="10139650">And, of course, that may raise another question too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.760" offset="10154696">Whether or not submitting it to the judge separately denies six men a right to try a fact to a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.792" offset="10290742">The state would have had no right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.041" offset="10295758">That would have been final, no matter how erroneous, even though he pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.254" offset="10308610">And that's the reference to all these cases the courts had.</text>

            <text syncTime="2579.479" offset="10457508">Under Arkansas law, it's statutory how it's done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.831" offset="10470987">If there is any evidence to support a lesser, it's submitted to the Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.552" offset="10481854">If the defendant so requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.934" offset="10491363">And the defendant can elect not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.416" offset="10497319">In this particular case the jury had four more or not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.236" offset="10512574">If they had said, we can find four more, two or three, or less than two, then that would be the posture we're in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.322" offset="10540891">But that's not before the court because nobody asked for lesser included offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.654" offset="10558236">Now, there are cases from some of the appellate courts that would allow a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.268" offset="10576731">For instance, suppose there are four elements of proof in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.751" offset="10594599">One of those elements is required for first degree murder and it's not proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.263" offset="10608705">The remaining evidence shows the defendant guilty of second degree murder but it was submitted to the jury only on first degree and the court reverses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.519" offset="10637648">Under Arkansas law, I submit, you'd have to send it back and find the man not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.109" offset="10652068">If a lesser included offense were submitted, the court could say we find him not guilty of first degree murder because of failure of proof but direct the lower court to enter a judgment of second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.226" offset="10688535">But that's not the case here.</text>
