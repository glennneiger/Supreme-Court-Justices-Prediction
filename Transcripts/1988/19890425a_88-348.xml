            <text syncTime="10.189" offset="174654">Mr. Lee.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="182386">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.974" offset="185730">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.109" offset="198269">This is an abstention case.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.459" offset="207673">The question presented is whether the court of appeals and the district court properly abstained from deciding a threshold preemption challenge to the jurisdiction of the Respondent, City Council, to consider disallowing in its retail rates wholesale costs that have been determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.207" offset="294713">The short reason why the Fifth Circuit's judgment must be reversed is that that judgment is based on an abstention standard that everyone sitting at the council table today agrees was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.163" offset="338494">But we all phrase it a little differently, all three of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.634" offset="352391">The Petitioner, Respondents, and the government are in basic agreement concerning the preliminary assessment that a federal court should make in deciding whether to abstain in a preemption case.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.359" offset="403278">Frankly, I think the Respondents say it best.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.477" offset="415712">Twice in their brief, at page 25 and again on page 30, they reiterate that the responsibility of a federal court in deciding whether to abstain from deciding a preemption claim where there is a pending state court proceeding is to decide whether the federal issue is facial, direct, readily apparent, and dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.259" offset="506932">Very frankly, very simply, the Fifth Circuit simply did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.096" offset="534203">Though the court did not formally reach the preemption issue, any objective reading of its opinion leaves no doubt that it regarded the federal preemption issue as controlling and correct and of a quality that placed the Council's prudence inquiry, in the language of the Fifth Circuit's opinion, beyond the Council's retail ratemaking authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.861" offset="629289">What the Fifth Circuit has held, therefore, is that abstention is required even where the preemption claim deprives the state of jurisdiction and regardless of how correct and dispositive the preemption claim must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.657" offset="696476">The net effect of that holding is to overrule this Court's consistent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.061" offset="722076">But one of the three prerequisites for Younger v. Harris abstention is the existence of a substantive state interest... something apart from an adjudicatory interest... which would be infringed if the federal court were to decide the federal issue.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="161.903" offset="781426">Mr. Lee, what if we had before us a state criminal case and the defendant raises, for example, a federal constitutional double jeopardy claim and says the state has no right to try him at all, and that issue would be completely dispositive of the state's right to try the case.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="191.340" offset="899186">It is different in this crucial respect, Justice O'Connor, and the answer to that question is pivotal to this decision because I am well aware of the post-Younger cases that have involved that kind of constitutional challenge to a state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.532" offset="959999">On at least three separate occasions subsequent to Younger v. Harris, the Court has reiterated and each time has made a little more explicit what was really said in Younger v. Harris itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.073" offset="1006184">And that is, that one of the reasons... I think the reason... for Younger v. Harris' abstention is that it gives, in those constitutional challenge cases, an opportunity to the state court to place a narrowing construction on the state statute in such a way that it will mediate between state and federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.003" offset="1093851">Now, the classic example of where that is possible is when you have such state statutes as were involved in these post-Younger v. Harris cases, such as obscenity statutes, criminal syndicalism statutes, lawyer disciplinary proceedings.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="254.580" stopTime="259.317">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="254.580" offset="1152156">I don't see how that fits--</text>
            <text syncTime="255.198" offset="1154664">--That's not true in double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.015" offset="1157903">--the double jeopardy claim though.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="259.317" offset="1171069">With a double jeopardy claim even so, there is still the possibility that the state court might be able to... depending on the circumstances of the case... that you might be able to have a narrow construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.125" offset="1218403">Now, in the event that in the particular instance there was not the opportunity for mediation because of a narrowing construction, then I would say it should come out the same way as here.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="318.122" offset="1406380">And I don't think any of the opinions say that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="320.140" offset="1414425">--Well, I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that that really is said in Moore v. Sims, perhaps most prominently, in Pennzoil, and in Trainor v. Hernandez.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.698" offset="1464685">And the notion that state courts ought to be able to decide these federal issues as well as federal courts can is certainly one of the underpinnings of Younger v. Harris, but it is not the only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.590" offset="1512228">Another one is that there must be... and the Court has consistently said that, and it is reiterated again in Pennzoil that it is more just an adjudicatory interest, more than just an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.998" offset="1557890">In the state courts deciding cases that are before it, there must be a substantive interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.682" offset="1576594">Now, in this case, the Petitioner... excuse me, the Respondents suggest two such interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.555" offset="1604074">The first is an interest in retail rate regulation, which is certainly important to states.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.323" offset="1623092">But, it simply is not at stake in this case because out of the total package of constituent elements that go into retail rate regulations, such as determining rates, the rate of return, what the rate base ought to be, and so forth, the only component that this federal suit would carve out and remove from the state's jurisdiction is the very one over which the Council has no jurisdiction anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.725" offset="1720790">The other state interest that is advanced is this one in setting the state's own house in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.794" offset="1749002">That is nothing but an exhaustion of state remedies argued, which the Court has consistently rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.198" offset="1774602">And it proves too much because school desegregation actions, for example... and, indeed, I think virtually every Section 1983 suit will inevitably involve allegations of wrongdoing by local governmental officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.208" offset="1834683">Surely, the federal courts are not required to bar the courthouse door to those kinds of suits in order to permit the state to set its own desegregation and civil rights violation house in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.718" offset="1888705">The other basis on which the Fifth Circuit held in--</text>

            <text syncTime="442.419" offset="1903542">Doesn't... in the context of a 1983 suit or a federal civil rights suit, doesn't your thesis also prove too much?</text>
            <text syncTime="452.442" offset="1943666">Do you say that... Do you say that when there is a state interest involved, when there is a possibility of a state statute being interpreted in a certain fashion that a federal court must abstain in civil rights and desegregation in 1983 situations as well?</text>

            <text syncTime="471.439" offset="2019630">--What we say, Justice Scalia, is almost that, but not quite.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.610" offset="2044290">But in the final analysis, it must be a balancing test, that you have to see to what extent federal interests are really involved and to what extent state interests are really involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.067" offset="2090161">Younger v. Harris itself said that what we need is a sensitivity to the legitimate interests of both state and national governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.888" offset="2121403">And among the factors to be taken into account are these that I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.875" offset="2137390">But, in this instance, the case is clear because we come into Court not with a blunderbuss but with a rifle and the one issue, what you have... what is being reviewed here is a Fifth Circuit judgment that assumed we were right on the preemption issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.240" offset="2234775">There is absolutely no question about that, Justice O'Connor, and I think that that poses the issue very neatly because if the Fifth Circuit's judgment is upheld, then the rule for abstention cases will be that abstention is proper whenever a state court can decide the federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.904" offset="2317426">That is not the law, has not been the law, and should not be the law because it makes a judicial comity, a street that runs only in one direction and does not take into account the competing federal interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.536" offset="2408019">It is easier, Justice Kennedy, once it has been concluded, for reasons that will be developed more by Mr. Lazarus.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.423" offset="2431529">But we would have been entitled to abstention in the earlier... in the early phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.042" offset="2450024">We agree in this respect with the Ninth Circuit, that in most cases where the sole issue before the federal court is preemption, a decision to abstain is necessarily a ruling on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.087" offset="2514181">And the reason is this: the controlling inquiry under Burford is whether the issues are predominantly local, and under Younger v. Harris it is whether there are legitimate state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.946" offset="2573635">A ruling that the... that there are predominantly local interests, or that there are legitimate state interests is necessarily a ruling that there is no preemption, because if there were preemption, then federal law would trump and there would be no state issue and no state interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.900" offset="2705501">But that is strictly an adjudicatory interest, and the Court is already past the point of deciding whether adjudicatory interests alone are enough to do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.458" offset="2751686">And every member of the Court in Pennzoil said that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.946" offset="2777599">Moreover, much more is at stake in this case than whether NOPSI's FERC-mandated costs are to be honored in its retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.872" offset="2833292">At issue in this case is nothing less than whether judicial comedy really is a two-way street or whether it favors only state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.578" offset="2876133">The crucial fact is that the Fifth Circuit... this is an abstention case.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.631" offset="2892329">It is not a preemption case, and the Court need not and should not reach the merits of the preemption issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.035" offset="2918034">The reason is that the Fifth Circuit has abstained on the broadest possible ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.356" offset="2939245">What it has said is we agree, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.908" offset="2953456">We assume that the preemption is argument is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.457" offset="4275670">Let's go through each of the pending state proceedings so I can try to show you where our position comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.143" offset="4294373">Starting with NOPSI's own lawsuit against the City Council... but that is a suit which is not brought to vindicate a state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.017" offset="4333870">NOPSI brought that suit in order to vindicate the integrity of FERC's allocation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.254" offset="4354873">It's merely protective in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.237" offset="4362814">If the Court were to rule that that was a basis of abstention, this case would be a mere sport because in the future utilities such as NOPSI, would not initiate such protective filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.728" offset="4404714">The second pending state proceeding is the City Council's lawsuit against NOPSI for declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.816" offset="4433136">But we believe that is an equally unnecessary proceeding within the meaning of Younger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.703" offset="4456646">The sole purpose of that proceeding is to confirm the results of an already completed administrative proceeding that has resulted in a final agency order with legal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.110" offset="4502308">It is, therefore, unlike any of the proceedings in which this Court has upheld Younger abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.247" offset="4522788">There is no ongoing criminal prosecution, no ongoing nuisance enforcement, no employment discrimination investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.901" offset="4549433">The sole purpose for that suit for declaratory relief is to have the state courts, rather than the federal courts, determine the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.507" offset="4579839">And in that way it really is most like the type of first-right collateral litigation that Younger was designed to discourage, not to encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.447" offset="4619650">Finally, there is the suit that had been brought by the Alliance for Affordable Energy in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.201" offset="4642638">But that suit, too, is not even directed immediately at NOPSI.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.408" offset="4687464">And it raises the wholly secondary question of whether NOPSI should have been denied an even greater share of Grand Gulf by the City Council.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.309" offset="6335059">The principal issue in this case is whether the lower federal courts should be required to step in and review state ratemaking decisions which are subject to full review in ongoing state court proceedings when a debatable preemption claim is raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.758" offset="6420845">Justice Scalia asked about the relationship of the Pennzoil case to our present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.328" offset="6447176">NOPSI here is seeking a utility company exemption from normal state court review in much the same way that Pennzoil or Texaco sought a Fortune 500 exemption in the Pennzoil case improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.838" offset="6513214">In Pennzoil... our fact pattern is considerably stronger in favor of abstention than Pennzoil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.693" offset="6544665">In Pennzoil the lower federal courts found that the Texas state courts were inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.263" offset="6566922">They found exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.799" offset="6577057">They found irreparable harm on the basis that Texaco could not meet a $13 billion bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.386" offset="6607359">In our case, the lower federal courts, both courts, found that the state court system was perfectly adequate to handle all of NOPSI's claims, including the preemption claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.594" offset="6652185">They found that the track record of state courts in Louisiana on preemption issues was very good, and that the tract record nationally on preemption issues for state courts was very good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.033" offset="6697952">That the states had essentially developed the Narragansett doctrine that is the core filed rate doctrine that NOPSI relies upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.572" offset="7040156">I think there would be three basic state interests, if I understand your assumption correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.577" offset="7068159">The first state interest would simply be that the state courts have an interest in governing their local regulators and making sure that they make correct decisions, particularly if there is a preemption claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.152" offset="7118419">If there is a preemption claim and a problem, the state courts should be allowed to address that and develop state policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.240" offset="10430850">And that simply brings me to my conclusion, that I would urge this Court not to accept or put its imprimatur on the basic essence of NOPSI's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2629.891" offset="10653413">And maybe that's the difference, whether it's the degree of difficulty of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.843" offset="10665221">It seems to me you do rest on a case in which there is a debatable issue of preemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.086" offset="10714226">But the example, again, that I would give is in the Younger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.954" offset="10733661">The criminal syndicalism statute, or one very similar to the one considered in Younger, was actually deemed invalid in the Brandenburg case which occurred, I believe, 19 months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.012" offset="10781936">And yet the Court felt, even though there was a substantial possibility that the statute was invalid... they still felt that abstention under those circumstances was appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.910" offset="11381498">And in this case, Justice O'Connor, I really think this case is your hypothetical because the only argument in the federal complaint is that this case is preempted and it deprives the state of jurisdiction.</text>
