            <text syncTime="188.187" offset="891491">And then the fourth and final conviction that brings us to court today is a conviction in state court in 1976, with the sentencing occurring in 1978, in which he was found guilty of two counts of assault in the first degree and sentenced to two life terms and then another court of aiding a prisoner to escape, with a 10-year term.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.881" offset="2210257">And the only claim he wants to make is a challenge to that conviction, and he brings it into state court and raises that challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.163" offset="2299387">And then the question is what kind of challenge may be brought to that previous conviction that was used and considered in imposing the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.401" offset="2336272">And what we're submitting to the Court is that the review given to that earlier conviction is different in scope than what would be given to the immediate trial and the immediate conviction, because the review would simply look to see whether or not the previous convictions were invalid on their face or whether they had previously been determined by another court to have been invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.552" offset="2432925">And we're thinking here, for example, of the Tucker case, in which the trial court had learned of three felony convictions of the defendant before him, and then when it came time for sentencing the court specifically considered those three convictions, and only after the sentencing learned that two of them were invalid on their face when the record came before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.405" offset="2552357">And that matter was then before this Court and it was sent back for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.940" offset="2566463">So there was a case of the general rule being that a sentencing court or a reviewing court will allow a sentencing judge to consider a wide range and a very loose sense and flexible standard as to the convictions that may be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.881" offset="12378264">Two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.400" offset="12384324">The first point is that the 1958 conviction is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.935" offset="12406476">It has been found to be valid in Washington courts, and I suppose if we had to predict we might well make it on the competency issue even today, if it were heard out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.897" offset="12470319">That is, the defense lawyer for Mr. Cook made the motion to the court to have doctors appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.383" offset="12496233">The defense lawyer presented the order to have Mr. Cook transported to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.454" offset="12516504">The record shows the doctors were paid and then Mr. Cook went to trial with that same lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.525" offset="12540745">So if there's a question for Mr. Cook to raise that were legitimate it would perhaps be as to competence of his counsel--</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.095" offset="12571047">But we think that's all really beside the point because the conviction has been found valid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.218" offset="12599573">The point that we'd like to make is this is being brought 27 years after the conviction, seven years after the expiration of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.157" offset="12635309">We think this process would... does undercut finality and the credibility of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.394" offset="12660282">We would encourage the Court to send the matter back with the clear expression that any challenge that may be brought is through the 1978 sentence rather than as directly against the '58 conviction.</text>
