            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151607">We'll near argument next in No. 87-1939, Geoffrey W. Barnard v. Susan Esposito Thorstenn and Virgin Islands Bar Association v. Thorstenn.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="199777">Ms. Hodge, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="maria_tankenson_hodge" startTime="65.208" stopTime="191.772">
            <label>Ms. Maria Tankenson Hodge</label>
            <text syncTime="65.208" offset="412414">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.575" offset="421818">The question that is certified before you in this proceeding is whether Frazier v. Heebe prohibits the District Court of the Virgin Islands from requiring residence as a requisite for the practice of law in the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.868" offset="475003">The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that Frazier bound the Court of Appeals to strike the Virgin Islands rule of residency and to exercise its supervisory power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.693" offset="526307">In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals was of the view that it need not consider the facts surrounding the practice of law in the Virgin Islands, but... that it was bound to treat Frazier as controlling as a matter of law, and disallowing rules of residence for any district court under its jurisdiction, which the District Court of the Virgin Islands is.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.208" offset="612407">But the Virgin Islands, and the court system in the Virgin Islands, are unique; and the factual circumstances surrounding our court system, we feel clearly make the rule that has been enforced in the Virgin Islands both reasonable and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.783" offset="666637">We would contend that the Court of Appeals erred in failing to consider whether the rule of residency was reasonable and necessary in the context of the practice of law in the Virgin Islands, and instead in applying Frazier as a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.442" offset="721285">There are two basic reasons why the Court of Appeals in our view is in error in its application of Frazier.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.929" offset="747303">First, the District Court of the Virgin Islands is not a United States district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.381" offset="765067">It is a court created by Congress, but it is a court in which Congress has vested the judicial power of the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.070" offset="791816">The court has also been given the jurisdiction of a United States district court, but its status and its role are quite different from that of the United States district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.759" offset="834552">It functions, in effect, as the supreme court of the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.561" offset="849808">It is the highest insular court and its rules of practice are, by rule, the rules for admission to the Virgin Islands bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.983" offset="883454">We have an integrated bar association, and thus when one is admitted by the District Court of the Virgin Islands to practice, he becomes a member of the Virgin Islands Bar Association.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="191.772" offset="918667">There's nothing in the Virgin Islands judicial system, like the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, that sits side by side with the federal district courts?</text>

            <label>Ms. Maria Tankenson Hodge</label>
            <text syncTime="200.278" offset="952626">That's correct, Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.028" offset="955656">Our district court functions as the closest equivalent to a supreme court of the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.515" offset="977599">It hears the appeals from the territorial court system, which is the lowest trial court system in the Virgin Islands in terms of... supervisory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.121" offset="1016051">The District Court of the Virgin Islands also acts as a court of original jurisdiction and hears civil matters where the amount in controversy is as little as $500, hears criminal matters where the charge is a felony even if the charge does not arise under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.248" offset="1084596">But the District Court of the Virgin Islands also functions as the appellate court for all decisions from the territorial court.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="239.486" offset="1109465">So we treat it as an instrumentality of the Virgin Islands?</text>

            <text syncTime="242.854" offset="1122944">I believe that that is the correct treatment, at least to this extent, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.740" offset="1138513">We think that the District Court of the Virgin Islands must be considered at least a hybrid court.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.294" offset="1156694">And in its rulemaking capacity, when it is fashioning rules for practice, since those rules by definition govern admission to the Virgin Islands bar as a whole, we think the proper standard to apply to that exercise of authority is at least the standard that the court would apply to a supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.386" offset="1221060">That is to say that the rule should not be struck under the exercise of the supervisory power, unless the rule would be unconstitutional, or unless it would be, in the language of the decisions from the territories that we have referred to, inescapably wrong or inescapably improper.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="286.300" offset="1296711">But by the same token, I take it if it's an instrumentality of the Virgin Islands, then the federal statute making the... privileges immunities clause applicable to the Virgin Islands does apply here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maria_tankenson_hodge" startTime="299.358" stopTime="302.477">
            <label>Ms. Maria Tankenson Hodge</label>
            <text syncTime="299.358" offset="1348956">Yes, the statute does apply and we are subject to the privileges and immunities.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maria Tankenson Hodge</label>
            <text syncTime="302.910" offset="1363166">In addition to the fact that the District Court of the Virgin Islands is this special and unique hybrid court, the Virgin Islands is in a factual setting which is quite unlike any that have reached the federal courts before, either under Frazier or under the several other cases which have been decided, Piper v. New Hampshire and Friedman v. Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.390" offset="1445086">The facts that make us so different begin with our geography.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.342" offset="1460969">We are, of course, at least 1,000 miles from the closest part of the continental United States, and this creates serious concern for the judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.114" offset="1495973">It means that a practicing lawyer who is not a resident of the Virgin Islands encounters travel difficulties which certainly do not face his counterparts, for example, who live in neighboring states like Vermont and New Hampshire.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.281" offset="1800665">The reason that we don't think it would work is that the Virgin Islands has a set of circumstances that differ from those of other jurisdictions in excess of our geographic isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.804" offset="1838804">We have, as we have mentioned in the briefs, the highest per capita crime rate in the United States, the lowest per capita income, and the highest number of cases per judgeship in our courts, in our federal courts, of any place in the United States for which statistics are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.515" offset="1905573">A consequence of that is that we have been required to develop a system under which all members of the bar are required to share the duty of serving in effect as public defenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.156" offset="1948205">That is not a system that seems workable with non-residents.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.368" offset="2017063">There would be at least one immediate problem with a system of that sort, and that is that it would clearly establish a kind of two-class system for the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.990" offset="2059486">The Virgin Islands has, I think, developed a quite delicate social fabric in which it is extremely important that Virgin Islanders know and believe that people who come to the Islands from the United States do not come equipped with a set of special rights which allows them to have preference in the way they conduct themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.804" offset="2134823">And if we had a system where non-residents were admitted to the bar, but were not required to function as the local lawyers do in taking their full share of criminal appointments, if they could in effect hire a mercenary substitute for themselves, I think there would be damage to the system that the District Court has devised for requiring all lawyers to fulfill their share of responsibility equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.650" offset="2222177">Also, we don't know that the system in Guam is working.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.935" offset="2235343">It's quite a recent innovation in response to what that court apparently believed was its obligations under this Court's decision in Frazier, and we have absolutely no evidence on this record that they are not encountering difficulties with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.682" offset="2522271">That is recognized both in Frazier and in Piper.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.335" offset="2536900">The, the concern that we have is that if the only problem with admission to the Virgin Islands bar were distance, if we only needed somebody to occasionally answer a motion call on short notice, aside from the District Court's concern that in most cases when that local lawyer appears in pro hac vice cases he answers, not ready, Judge, I didn't know this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.999" offset="2623522">But putting that concern aside, we have the complicated situation that it is, in the case of the Virgin Islands, not merely distance, but distance complicated with a transportation system that's very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.724" offset="2670438">We as a destination are a tiny island.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.093" offset="2679947">We don't have the kind of commercial transportation facilities that exist for the cross-country commuters between, say, California and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.762" offset="2710562">We have a limited number of airlines serving us, we have very high tourist travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.650" offset="2730206">And the District Court said in its decision, it clearly did not feel that ready access to transportation was available to the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.137" offset="2760090">The other thing that the Court said, Justice Scalia, in both Frazier and Piper, was that perhaps there need not be quite so much concern about distance alone, since it was becoming increasingly common to use telephone conferences as a substitute for in-person appearances in some of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.516" offset="2825605">In the Virgin Islands, as the District Court has pointed out, however, that is not a ready substitute, since our telephone service is not reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.621" offset="2857997">The District Court specifically found that telephone service to the Virgin Islands is subject to problems with transmission, echoes, loss of connections, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.143" offset="2892165">And, therefore, the Court could not rely on telephone conferences in the Virgin Islands as a ready substitute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.202" offset="6624332">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.873" offset="6655052">This case concerns the validity... of certain residency requirements for members in the bar of the District Court of the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.962" offset="6683369">And before discussing why we believe this restrictions are invalid, I think it's useful to point out what non-residents would have to do as a practical matter to be licensed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.950" offset="6715343">And I think it'll show that here, as in Piper, Frazier, and Friedman, lawyers are not likely to seek membership unless they anticipate a regular and substantial practice in the Virgin Islands, and that these factors make it likely they will satisfy the professional obligations to the same extent as non-residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.327" offset="6780858">An applicant must take a two-day bar exam in the Virgin Islands in July, and even experienced lawyers must take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.148" offset="6808129">There's no way of waiving in, as was the case in Friedman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.600" offset="6817951">There's no review course, so a lawyer must travel to the Virgin Islands in order to study recent decisions, statutes, and become abreast of developments in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.817" offset="6926830">They are willing to pay the $600 a year in addition to bar membership obligations elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.904" offset="6947205">They have retained a partnership arrangement with an attorney in the Virgin Islands, they've staffed the office, they have FAX machines, telephone machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.844" offset="6978970">And they also have clients who are willing to retain their services because of their particular expertise, which they do not believe they can obtain simply with island attorneys.</text>

            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="1751.623" offset="7158066">Let me answer that in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.273" offset="7164649">Again, I think we have to parse it in terms of what Ms. Hodge said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.777" offset="7178650">The four appointments are not all in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.812" offset="7194846">As we pointed out in our brief, at note seven, there is at most one appointment a year in the District Courts, and only the District Court has this no-substitutions preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.685" offset="7234343">The other three of so on an average occur in the territorial court, a trial court of limited jurisdiction, where there is not this type of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.706" offset="7266422">There may be generally four cases on an average, but lawyers in the Virgin Islands, in the territorial court, can send down an associate, can ask someone to substitute for them, and the system works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.562" offset="7305814">It is only in the District Court that you have this preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.950" offset="7319398">And to the extent, as Ms. Hodge indicated, there is flexibility in that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.854" offset="7343013">And that's one of the problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.387" offset="7349073">The briefs suggest that the no-substitutions practice is administered in a very rigid manner, that if one is recovering from open-heart surgery, or in depositions in the mainland, or travelling in Europe, that there are no exceptions made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.029" offset="7407692">But I think Ms. Hodge's answer to your question earlier today, Justice Kennedy, suggested that it is more flexible and, to the extent there is exceptions made, the respondents may ask in appropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.921" offset="7455235">But they're willing to do whatever is obliged, and as a practical matter, the no-substitutions practice applies only to the extent that they are called to act in District Court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.395" offset="7497135">There are several factors that were alluded to in Ms. Hodge's argument that I would like to point out which suggest that this rule is not as carefully tailored to survive scrutiny under Piper or under Frazier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.953" offset="7547395">First of all, as Justice Blackmun's question pointed out, the rule applies not simply to mainlanders but to lawyers in Puerto Rico who are only 40 miles away, and there are six airlines flying between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.379" offset="7605073">It's one of the best-served markets in terms of the frequency of flights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.259" offset="10436642">--Correct, But while we're on the area of the adequacy of service, I think it's important here not simply to focus on the District Court's opinion in this case, but to go back a few years to the case we cited, Tradewinds v. Citibank, where the same exact issue was at issue, was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.519" offset="10501635">The issue... the legal issue there was whether a national bank could be sued only in jurisdiction where it was chartered, or whether it could be sued anywhere where it had a branch office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.458" offset="10541341">And the District Court, the same district judge who presided over this case, decided that it was perfectly permissible to let the company be sued in the Virgin Islands, and it cited tremendous advances in terms of airline service, in terms of telecommunications, and in terms of data processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.769" offset="10610618">It simply cannot be said on this record, and if one looks at the judicial pronouncements previously, that the service is good enough to permit mainland clients to come down to the Virgin Islands and be sued, that the phone service is good enough to let them come down, but there is simply not enough room on the plane for mainland lawyers to come down, or the phones don't work it it's a mainland lawyer who wants to call down to the islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.486" offset="10709465">And I'd put something else in terms of the adequacy of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.605" offset="10722004">This rule does not prohibit Virgin Islands lawyers from engaging in practice on the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.925" offset="10751261">They can litigate cases of represent clients in New York or Virginia or Louisiana or New Hampshire, and the rule would seem to assume that objective criteria, such as the availability of airline seats, the adequacy of telecommunications, work sufficiently well that they will get back and they can communicate if they need to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.125" offset="10848018">I, I suppose if we had before us a case where Maine tried to exclude from practice lawyers who were admitted only in the Virgin Islands, then, then we might have to confront that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.598" offset="10893994">I guess the state of Maine could well come in and say, in light of the terrible plane service and telecommunications with the Virgin Islands, though we're willing to let people here from all other states and territories, not from the Virgin Islands.</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.775" offset="10950627">I mean, to the extent that the justification is based on the idea that you need to be able to handle cases directly in the Virgin Islands, and you need to communicate directly, the rule assumes that anyone who is practicing in Maine will be able to satisfy his or her professional obligations in the Virgin Islands as well, that one can travel to the mainland and still come back if one needs to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.188" offset="11036309">And our point is that there's simply no reason for assuming that only Virgin Islands lawyers will be conscientious and come back to do their duties, but not mainland lawyers who want to divide their practice... well, it is a concern not simply of Maine but also of the Virgin Islands as well, again to the extent that it's premised on the idea about adequacy of, of seats and the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.933" offset="11815280">There would be no question that this sort of restriction would be valid, but after 1968, Congress extended this provision, and we think it's significant for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.888" offset="11851120">Several cases from this Court, Mullaney v. Anderson in 1952, and other cases involving the Alaska territory, regarded the presence or absence of the privileges and immunities clause as important, because it indicates Congress' Judgment about how isolated a territory is, how much discretion and latitude a territorial judgment should have in being able to decide whether to favor its own residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.606" offset="11953938">There may be good reasons for a territory to decide, we want to favor our local residents, or give preferences to people who move here, because it's kind of rugged, because we want to give people a chance to move in or an incentive to move in, to stay, to populate the territory, and to develop the territory if one day it might come forward and be ready for state... for statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.554" offset="12045785">But the Court fund in Mullaney that it was significant that Congress had enacted the privileges and immunities clause with respect to Alaska, and it brought Alaska into line with the practice in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.962" offset="12095418">That was, as I recall, Fisherman's case, such as Toomer against Witsell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.914" offset="12107225">And I think that that fact helps to put this case into the proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.385" offset="12129063">Congress, which has plenary authority in this area under Article IV, Section 3, looked at this issue about to what extent the Virgin Islands ought to be similar to the other territories in the mainland, and it decided in 1968 in the amendments to the fact that the Virgin Islands are ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.762" offset="12198654">The 1968 is a home rule statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.964" offset="12211401">It gives the Virgin Islands the right to elect a territorial governor and lieutenant governor, as they had previously been able to elect a territorial legislature, and it extended constitutional provisions to the Virgin Islands consistent with their status as a territory, and by that I mean consistent with the fact that citizens of territories don't vote in national elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.712" offset="12290396">In our view, it reflects Congress' judgment that with political rights come political responsibilities, including the responsibility of treating citizens on a non-discriminatory basis, citizens of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.221" offset="12348387">I think it's useful to point out as well that this type of residency restriction is not simply limited to the legal profession or to lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.808" offset="12382765">As the amicus brief filed by Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Weatherly indicate, there are a number of other similar rules on the books affecting a number of other professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.731" offset="12418500">Podiatrists, electricians, plumbers, architects, engineers, land surveyors, and taxicab drivers, all are subject to residency requirements if they seek to practice their profession in the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.574" offset="12473880">And we submit that that also casts doubt on the, the argument that this rule is specifically and narrowly tailored to deal with a specific concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.262" offset="12512645">I wanted to respond also to one point that Justice Stephens made earlier on in terms of the question to Ms. Hodge about are lawyers disbarred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.285" offset="12544724">The opinion issued in the District Court indicates, suggests perhaps more accurately, that lawyers who refuse to take their share of cases may be excluded from practicing in District Court, but it does not suggest they may be totally disbarred and forbidden from engaging in any kind of office practice or practice that does not involve litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.132" offset="12624031">In this case, the Petition... the Respondents are willing to do whatever is obliged of any other resident requirement... of any other residents of the Virgin Islands, and we submit that the case--</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.747" offset="12918588">In fact, It's more exclusionary than the rule in Piper which said simply that you have to live in the state on the day you're admitted.</text>

          <turn speaker="maria_tankenson_hodge" startTime="3217.897" stopTime="3370.713">
            <label>Ms. Maria Tankenson Hodge</label>
            <text syncTime="3217.897" offset="13023183">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.697" offset="13030392">The reasons that the Virgin Islands rule of residence is broadly applicable, not only to litigators, is that all lawyers who practice in the Virgin Islands are by definition litigators, since all lawyers take their share of appointments and therefore, whether they might have fashioned themselves a specialty that didn't include any litigation or not, in fact we all are litigators, as least part time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.613" offset="13126000">Our rule is criticized as being somehow broader than the rule at issue in Piper because it applies and requires not only that you live in the jurisdiction at the time you're admitted but that you continue to live there throughout the duration of your active practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.308" offset="13196740">But it's my understanding that in the former opinions the states have been criticized for having rules that only require you to be a resident at the time of your admission and allowed you to then surrender your residency but keep your active practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.699" offset="13238327">In the Virgin Islands, once admitted, if you move away from the territory you become an inactive member of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.686" offset="13262255">You do not remain active because the court holds the view that you cannot fulfill your responsibilities to the court to be present when needed, to remain informed on Virgin Island law, and to fulfill your responsibilities if you don't live in the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.160" offset="13316172">It is not the case, and we've made this point before but I felt the need to repeat it in response to the argument, that the Virgin Islands contends that applicants for admission before you are not, or at least were not at the time they passed the Virgin Islands bar, competent lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.222" offset="13384404">But in terms of competency there is a concern of the Virgin Islands that wasn't mentioned in earlier arguments, and that is that unlike the law of New Hampshire or the law of Virginia or the law of Louisiana, our law is not readily of disseminated across the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.649" offset="13442187">The decisions of the courts of the Virgin Islands for the most part, for at least a year and a half, are available only in the District Court libraries, and photocopies, so the resident bar that has to go the District Court library and use an index system to do their research on current decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.808" offset="13498820">The same is true of statutes passed by the Virgin Islands legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.343" offset="13512926">None of the major publication systems of legal research include Virgin Islands reference materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.664" offset="13538213">We're not in Westlaw, we're not in LEXIS, we're simply just not available across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.651" offset="13558170">And the view of a nationwide bar that can readily cross the boundaries of the state and provide specialized service to clients may be a very good view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.840" offset="13590876">But it does not necessarily apply to a small territory whose laws are unique to itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.494" offset="13613550">We're not, as you know, covered by every federal statute.</text>
