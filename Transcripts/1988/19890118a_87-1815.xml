            <text>We'll hear argument now in Number 87-1815, the Kentucky Department of Corrections v. James M. Thompson.</text>
            <text>Mrs. Jones, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case was brought by the Commonwealth because the Sixth Circuit ruled that state procedures written for staff use in the operation of visitation program created a constitutionally-protected right.</text>
            <text>In 1980 the Commonwealth signed a consent decree.</text>
            <text>In that decree the Commonwealth agreed to continue to operate certain programs, at least at their current level, and the continuation of open visitation was one of those programs.</text>
            <text>In 1986, the Respondents filed a request with the district court, through appropriate motions, asking the court to direct the Commonwealth to implement due process procedures before it restricted visitation or visitors from the institution.</text>
            <text>Respondents argued that the Commonwealth's failure to implement these due process procedures was in violation of the consent decree and the due process clause.</text>
            <text>The district court concluded that no violations of the consent decree had occurred, but ruled that the language of the consent decree itself, which addressed the visitation programs, were so mandatory in character that it gave rise to a liberty interest requiring the implementation of due process procedures.</text>
            <text>And the Court directed that the Commonwealth implement those kinds of procedures recommended by this Court in Hewitt v. Helms before visitation was suspended or revoked, and that is a notice opportunity to be... opportunity to respond.</text>
            <text>On appeal, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the procedures themselves were mandatory in character, substantively limited the discretion of the state official by enumerating particularized standards or criteria, and created to protect the liberty interest, thus requiring the implementation of due process procedures.</text>
            <text>The Sixth Circuit then remanded the case back to the district court for directions in accordance with its mandate.</text>
            <text>When determining whether state procedures create a... protect the liberty interest, the Commonwealth is urging that this Court draw a line between those procedures which affect the daily management of a prison from those procedures which affect length of confinement, release from confinement, or those procedures which dramatically alter the very nature of confinement.</text>
            <text>When state procedures are drafted which affect--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What do you include in that last category?</text>
            <text>It isn't clear to me what you have in mind--</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">

            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--The kinds of things that we see in terms of nature of confinement are the kinds of... I could reference the Court to the cases where we think fall within that definition.</text>
            <text>And that would be this Court's decisions in Vitek v. Jones, which address mental involuntary commitment to a mental facility; Hewitt v. Helms, where there was incarceration--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Solitary confinement?</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>We're saying that that dramatically alters the nature of confinement, and when that's written in conjunction with due process procedure... our procedures are very limiting in the discretion of the officials, that that would meet that standards.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I suppose the argument of the other side is that having family visitors is so vitally important in terms of a prisoner's existence, that it alters the nature of the confinement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>We would view that as a condition of confinement, and this Court has ruled that in Olim and in other cases, but I think Olim addressed the question, although that was not the ruling and the holding of the case... this Court recognized in Olim that a transfer from Hawaii to California, which would subject an individual to not having access to family or friends, did not implicate any serious interest and denial of visits and visitors is a very normal type of limit of confinement that is expected in penal settings.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What if the denial were totally arbitrary?</text>
            <text>The guard doesn't like prisoner X and says,</text>
            <text>"I'm just not going to let you have any visitors."</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>I think that's clearly protected under the cruel and unusual punishment clause or unreasonable and arbitrary harassment that state officials cannot act in that manner towards--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So, you concede that some deprivation of visitors could arise or could amount to an Eighth Amendment violation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--I think some conduct of state officials, if they've singled out an inmate, not necessarily for visiting, but any... whatever it is, visiting, denying him access to a library... if it is so arbitrary and unreasonable that it could reach the level of an Eighth Amendment claim--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So... so cruel and unusual punishment covers more ground than due process?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--I don't see that.</text>
            <text>I don't think that's what I'm suggesting.</text>
            <text>I'm suggesting that I think that this Court has ruled... and I think it was in Whitley v. Albers... that there are... that an inmate is not totally unprotected from... no, I'm sorry, I believe it's in the Daniels v. Williams and Davidson v. Cannon where this Court said inmates are not totally unprotected from arbitrary and unreasonable conduct by state officials and cannot be... harassed.</text>
            <text>And I believe that is within the Eighth Amendment, and I think this Court has recognized that in those decisions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mrs. Jones--</text>
            <text>--What you're talking about here is really state-created rights, isn't it, and not rights that stem from the Constitution themselves?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
            <text>And our point here is you have state-created rights.</text>
            <text>And this Court has found in most of its decisions that address a penal setting, and in particular Greenholtz, that every executive decision made by an executive branch member is not guaranteed to be error-free.</text>
            <text>And we are suggesting that when you find state... if you define procedures that just address daily policy programs between those procedures which affect substantive areas of incarceration, then you're allowing the state to draft procedures that are very directory in nature to run their programs, but you're not subjecting them to federal liability at every turn when they're trying to run a program or a facility to protect the institution and the community.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mrs. Jones, why do you have to use the cruel and unusual punishment clause to answer Justice O'Connor's problem?</text>
            <text>Why wouldn't the equal protection clause cover that situation if the rules are intentionally applied in a... in an unreasonable manner against a particular prisoner?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>The way I understand the decisions in the equal protection clause is the individual is going to have to be a member of the suspect class first.</text>
            <text>And I don't think an inmate is a member of a suspect class.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is that right?</text>
            <text>The state can do anything it wants to me and treat me differently from the rest of society unless I'm a member of a suspect class?</text>
            <text>I didn't understand that.</text>
            <text>I hope it's not true.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>I may be misunderstanding the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text>I'm thinking in terms... well, I think the... as I recollect the cases, the Court has only held that equal protection applies in a prison setting when you're dealing with a suspect class, that you couldn't separate inmates on the basis of race alone.</text>
            <text>And, although this Court has not addressed sex discrimination cases, those are the only cases that I'm familiar with as they address in a penal setting.</text>
            <text>Maybe I'm too broadly interpreting the equal protection clause, but that's the way I understand it.</text>
            <text>Now, I think the other thing that is important, Your Honor, is that the inmate is not without administrative or state law remedies in a situation where state officials don't conform themselves with their own state policies and procedures.</text>
            <text>In the Commonwealth, and I think it's very typical in other states, there are mandamus actions that individuals can bring if the duties that are set out in the state regulation or state law are so ministerial in nature that it... that a state official must be required to conform himself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Oh, but is that true of the particular rights at stake in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>I don't think these procedures are so ministerial in nature--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Isn't that your position that the... if the prison officials want to do so, they can just deny, say, the inmate's mother or his wife or some friend visiting privileges and never even tell the inmate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--Absolutely.</text>
            <text>I don't think we have to even have visitation.</text>
            <text>I think the responsible--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And you... and you don't even have to give the inmate notice that... telling him whether or not his wife has tried to see him or not.</text>
            <text>You just... it's just one of those minor details of prison management the prisoner has no rights in.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--Your Honor, I don't think we're taking that broad a position.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I think you are.</text>
            <text>You're saying there no constitutional right at all.</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>Well, that's correct, we are saying--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And you're saying you have a right to promulgate no regulations at all.</text>
            <text>Therefore, the rights you're seeking to vindicate... is one to simply say I'm sorry, I know you're curious, but we're not going to tell you.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--That is what the position is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yeah.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--In its broadest term.</text>
            <text>That's correct Practically speaking I, Your Honor--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yeah, unless it becomes cruel and unusual and violates the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text>That's the limitation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--That's correct.</text>
            <text>But what we're also suggesting to this Court is this principle of law that was applied by the Sixth Circuit to this fact situation, carried to its logical conclusion, will require every procedure that addresses the daily operation of a prison to create federally protected rights, so that the state is going to have to implement some kind of due process almost in every situation.</text>
            <text>And the examples that we have given the Court are those library procedures that are even more mandatory if you're going to interpret our procedures as mandatory.</text>
            <text>The library procedures say that we will not deny an inmate access to the library unless he doesn't return the books.</text>
            <text>That has a shall/unless combination that has pretty much been looked upon by the courts below as the mandatory-type language that creates these rights.</text>
            <text>And we're saying that if we don't... if the Court doesn't draw a line and make a distinction between procedures that are daily management-type procedures versus procedures which affect certain areas of incarceration, then we've got a very serious problem, and the state only has two choices: They can accept that ruling and continue to operate with very detailed mandatory directory procedures, or they can choose to write no procedures at all, which is not the choice of state officials.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, Mrs. Jones, isn't there a possible third solution, like in your library... to simply reword the regulation so that it's... it's... gives some more discretion to the officials.</text>
            <text>Maybe, this isn't what you really want to do, but certainly that would avoid the conclusion that it creates a liberty interest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>Certainly the state can reword the procedures.</text>
            <text>What happens when you reword the procedure to allow total discretion, you have deluded one of the purposes of the procedures.</text>
            <text>The purpose of the procedure is to direct staff so that they can operate the program.</text>
            <text>It allows for control and discipline to maintain security in the institution.</text>
            <text>If you allow total... if you diluted the procedure to such an extent that you've allowed total discretion, then I don't think you've served the purpose of... of the prison--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And probably not the purpose of the consent decree.</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--That's correct.</text>
            <text>In this instance, it wouldn't serve the purpose of the consent decree.</text>
            <text>But you've also allowed the state officials to carve out the contours of a federally protected right, just by semantical or mechanical word change.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, but... you're talking about a federally protected right.</text>
            <text>Are we still talking about a right created by these regulations?</text>
            <text>Yes.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, then, it's not... it's not really a federally created right.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>Well, if I'm using it in an improper term, I apologize.</text>
            <text>But what we're saying is by the way they're written, they are interpreted as being a liberty interest protected by the due process clause, and maybe that's a shorthand term.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>We would like to have a line drawn and distinctions made between certain procedures so that's...

            <text>And then the other areas that we would suggest... one way that I think I could suggest to you that may be visually easier to understand is, we would... it's like a prison door-type situation, and the parole... very easily to see that the parole cases and the release from confinement or the good time credits, they go out the prison door.</text>
            <text>And the administrative segregation, the inmate goes from a more... a general population-type situation through the prison door to a more restricted-type setting.</text>
            <text>In a mental health-type situation in Vitek, they are going from the institution to another institution involuntary.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>The visitor doesn't have any interest and has no right to visit the facility, and this Court's ruled on that in Jones v. North Carolina.</text>
            <text>That, as the Court knows, was the press wanting access to the institution, and this Court has clearly ruled that.</text>
            <text>And I believe this Court reaffirmed the position on visitors with respect to the Olim decision, although, again, that was not the holding.</text>
            <text>More recently, Block v. Rutherford, although it was not... it was not denial of total visitation, it was a visitation case that dealt with a non-contact versus contact visitation.</text>
            <text>And I think this Court has made it very clear that visitation and restriction of visitation is very clearly within the normal range of limits.</text>
            <text>That aspect is expected in a penal facility.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What's the constitutional principle or premise that underlies that distinction?</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--Well we're trying... I think it arises--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Just the important versus unimportant or--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>--I think it arises from this Court's decisions where this Court has continually in the prison cases in the penal area have recognized there's a need to give deference to the prison administrator, not be continually involved in the daily operations of a prison setting, and I think some of the language in the Hewitt decision has... has been concerned that this analysis could create a problem for prison administrators by maybe not creating exception for procedures that are just daily management procedures that affect programs that are just the daily restricted-type programs that involve a way to operate a prison.</text>
            <text>And if I state official cannot write procedures running the program that are very directory in nature and mandatory in style and premise participation in that program or the denial of participation in that program on whether that individual or whether that visitor is going to constitute a threat to the security of the institution, which is the primary purpose of the institution, and that's the primary purpose of the policies and procedures is to maintain the security of the institution, then the state really can't write any kind of procedures that direct any of its staff in order to maintain control or discipline over its facility.</text>
            <text>And we don't think that the proposition that we're offering this Court is... is not inconsistent with this Court's opinions.</text>
            <text>If, if you review the Court's parole cases, there the Court found no inherent right to parole, but the Court found that the state statutes which were drafted which affected parole were very limited in nature, very... they will not be denied parole or they will not be revoked... their parole would not be revoked unless certain conditions existed.</text>
            <text>You had a two-pronged analysis.</text>
            <text>You had the nature of the interest at stake affected release from confinement, and you had mandatory procedures that were very, very specific and conditioned on certain factors.</text>
            <text>Similarly, in the Wolff v. McDonnell case, the Court clearly recognized that there was no right to the establishment of good time credits, but once the state created that right to good time credits, the denial of good time credits or the forfeiture of good time credits again was conditioned on a varied set of circumstances, a very specific set of circumstances, major misconduct, and they would not be forfeited but for those set of circumstances.</text>
            <text>So, again, you had a very serious nature of interests created by the state law, which affected the release from confinement, and you had very specific procedures which directed the state not to take away that good time, unless certain conditions existed.</text>
            <text>Then in the Vitek cases, which we would identify to the Court as the type of cases that affect the very nature of confinement, in Vitek in this Court's affirmance of Wright v. Enomoto and then the Hewitt v. Helms decision, I think you're addressing the kind of nature of confinement cases the Commonwealth is suggesting to the Court the line that ought to be drawn.</text>
            <text>We would recommend another type of nature of confinement subject that might be involved in this area would be forced medication.</text>
            <text>Forced medication has not been addressed by this Court, but it's the same kind of nature, very substantive nature of a prison's confinement that addresses very serious areas that could affect them adversely and sort of fits within the prison door concept for an explanation.</text>
            <text>And in those decisions that--</text>

            <text>You're... it boils down to what's serious or not serious, and I'm not sure how we derive that from the language of the due process clause.</text>

            <text>The problem that's been created by the decisions in the courts below and in the district court, and I think the record clearly demonstrates that, is that if we don't draw a line, there's a very serious problem for state officials to operate their facilities.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>

            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>

            <text>Well, I think the only alternative, Your Honor, if we don't do that, in order to aid the states, is we would have to take a very restrictive, even more narrow rule unless the state drafts policies that affect substantive rights that have already been recognized as this Court protected by the Constitution itself.</text>

            <text>[Laughter]</text>
            <text>This consent... one of the important parts of this case is that this consent decree was the result of four years of vigorous litigation by highly skilled counsel, including myself, Mrs. Jones, and representatives of the United States Justice Department as litigating amicus curiae.</text>
            <text>When the case was settled, no fewer than 13 lawyers signed the consent decree.</text>
            <text>This gives ample evidence of when a state official, after that kind of intensive litigation, signs a consent decree, that it is the volitional act of those state officials.</text>
            <text>Prior to the Kentucky correctional policies and procedures being promulgated, there was a prior procedure called the internal management directives.</text>
            <text>The internal management directives concerning visitation are quite similar to what was later issued post-consent decree.</text>
            <text>A case by the name of Bills v. Henderson, a Sixth Circuit case, indicated in 1980 that a consent that a liberty interest could be created in the Sixth Circuit</text>
            <text>"in the forfeiture or benefit of favorable living conditions."</text>
            <text>This case was decided prior to the reissue of... of the procedures by the State of Kentucky.</text>

            <text>What Judge Johnstone and the Sixth Circuit said was the,</text>
            <text>"open visitation language and the Sixth Circuit, later the regulations issued, gave the inmates an entitlement to continue open visitation."</text>
            <text>And at that point, it had its basis in the consent decree, but the right for the hearing arises from the Fourteenth Amendment because the state has taken the volitional act.</text>
            <text>The state has extended the right, the state has created this right, and then, therefore, once they create the right and fetter their own discretion, the Fourteenth Amendment comes into play.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph S. Elder, II</label>
            <text>They created this right three ways: by issuing... by signing the consent decree and by putting the open visitational language in the consent decree, and by issuing the correctional policies and procedures which are statewide, and the Kentucky State Reformatory policies and procedures, which are institutionwide.</text>
            <text>And in... through each... throughout each of these there is the mandatory language required by Hewitt, with the substantive predicates to follow.</text>
            <text>And in two portions of the regulations a nonexhaustive listing of criteria for the officer to follow.</text>
            <text>Counsel for the defendants has indicated these are for staff goals alone.</text>
            <text>They're also to assist the inmate in learning what conduct is sufficient within an institution that's going to get you your visitation denied.</text>
            <text>And one of the reasons that a prison's supposed to promulgate regulations, according to the American Correctional Association, is so that the inmate knows what's to be expected of him.</text>
            <text>It's not only for staff benefit but, by its own very nature, is to tell the inmate what limits are to be expected.</text>
            <text>I think one of the keys is the fact that through the regulations, there is repeated use of mandatory language.</text>
            <text>There is the mandatory language of the consent decree.</text>
            <text>There's also the substantive predicates required in the Hewitt v. Helms.</text>
            <text>I think if you look at the regulations that are attached to the Petitioners' brief, the regulations that are going to create the monster, that is going to create the day-to-day problem for the Corrections Cabinet in their opinion of dealing with the Sixth Circuit's opinion is that the mandatory language followed by substantive predicate is simply not there with the possible exception of the library card.</text>
            <text>I think this Court could draw a line about library cards.</text>
            <text>I believe that failure to return a library book and therefore having your library privileges denied could be dealt with by a part of the Hewitt opinion.</text>
            <text>One of the thing the Hewitt opinion says in its later stages is that the hearing should create some benefit to the institution and some benefit in dealing with the problem at hand.</text>
            <text>For example, would a hearing over whether or not your library privileges be returned be of any benefit to the institution or to the inmate?</text>
            <text>I think the Court could draw that line.</text>

            <text>To get that in real life.</text>
            <text>I mean, if the library decides to revoke your library privileges, you don't necessarily get a hearing.</text>

            <text>--It is a predicate right.</text>
            <text>I'm attempting to address the issue of if somebody does create a predicate right in an absolutely minor matter... for example, the case I cited in my brief of the United States v. State of Michigan, which deals with whether or not you have the right to food versus a food loaf.</text>
            <text>There is no question in that case that the food loaf was adequately nutrition... was adequately nutritious for the inmate in that situation.</text>
            <text>It didn't taste as goods, basically, was a problem.</text>
            <text>The court, in that case, found that you had an entitlement to not having food loaf to having regular food, and then basically at that point dismissed whether or not a hearing had to be held.</text>
            <text>It's unclear exactly what standard the court applied in that case.</text>
            <text>That is only a minor matter.</text>
            <text>I think this Court could draw it and say a minor matter or a situation where a hearing would have no benefit either to the cabinet or to the inmate.</text>
            <text>In the case at bars, as I understand what the Sixth Circuit did on remand, what they put in their remand, was that the hearing does not have to be on the spot.</text>
            <text>We are not telling the correctional officer at the institution who is standing at a visitation denial for possibly a reason of violence or contraband that they have to stop at that moment and have a hearing.</text>
            <text>The Sixth Circuit, I believe, would require and the district court a hearing within a reasonable time.</text>
            <text>I believe that a hearing within a reasonable time in which an inmate has some ability to rebut, in essence, the Corrections Cabinet's evidence.</text>
            <text>Justice Stevens asked what would be sufficient for the Sixth Circuit, whether or not just a note was sufficient.</text>
            <text>The Sixth Circuit said... went one little step further, which is an opportunity to be heard, did not interpret it as requiring a hearing as in court calls Kentucky State Reformatory, or face to face but, essentially, paper.</text>
            <text>The State of Kentucky drops the inmate a note saying your mother brought contraband to the prison last week.</text>
            <text>We're going to suspend her visitation.</text>
            <text>The inmate write it back and says, I'm sorry, that was inmate Jones' mother and not mine.</text>
            <text>If you'll check your records, you've made a mistake.</text>

            <text>Would you... what would your view be on the question of whether if you set up these procedures, very minimal procedures, and then nobody did give an inmate notice that his mother couldn't visit for the next six months, would he be able to recover damages?</text>

            <text>If it got down to a question of whether or not it was an... it was a... the decision was correct, I think this Court would clearly apply a Superintendent v. Wolpole-type standard to that situation.</text>
            <text>I think a total failure of the process, it might go as to whether or not it would be a qualified immunity question at that point.</text>
            <text>I think a total failure of the process would clearly be actionable.</text>
            <text>One of the problems, I believe, with the analysis of the state is that it takes... in, in... and in a due process analysis, first, I think, in an analysis such as this, you look to the Constitution to see whether or not there is a constitutional right to visitation.</text>
            <text>It is clear there is no constitutional right to visitation.</text>
            <text>Then you look to the actions of the state officials to see whether or not the state officials have created any sort of right.</text>
            <text>What the state is asking us to do at that point is to come back, if you will, on the back end of substantive... of derivative due process and impose on the back side, in essence, a substantive due process theory that it would be only in matters of some sort of critical importance.</text>
            <text>I think that is beyond the scope of what derivative due process is all about.</text>
            <text>I believe you have to look to what did the state officials intend.</text>

            <text>Yes, sir.</text>
            <text>I think under the... I believe that even though you may step beyond what is constitutional, the court can still have authority over that consent decree, even for visitation.</text>
            <text>I don't think there's any requirement that this Court, that I'm aware of, that only constitutional issues be brought up in a consent decree.</text>
            <text>They are... they're wide ranging.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph S. Elder, II</label>
            <text>In a litigated decree if the judge was to step beyond and accept independent state action, there would be a problem that would be subject to reversal by the court.</text>
            <text>The parties have agreed that, yes, we're going to do this in return for this.</text>
            <text>For example, one of the things that they agreed to do was to have the prison population of the Kentucky State Reformatory at a certain level within so many years.</text>
            <text>Possibly if I had gone to trial and settled the case, Judge Johnstone might have ordered a quicker timetable to bring the... the population down to a level where it would be constitutional.</text>
            <text>Of course, population in and of itself is not a constitutional question, it's a totality, population being only one of the factors.</text>

            <text>Your Honor's question is whether or not if an inmate were to tomorrow be denied prison... be denied his "open visitation", could I then not go back and request that the judge put the case back on a... on active status and request that the judge hold the state in contempt because this inmate did not have a... his visitational, open visitation was being denied.</text>
            <text>That is correct.</text>
            <text>However, I think that the Sixth Circuit in saying that we're not going to make this a consent decree matter, that a consent decree is only a portion of it.</text>
            <text>A consent decree, in and of itself, was only a portion of the mandatory language required to reach the... to give an entitlement to due process.</text>
            <text>I believe that probably, standing alone, the regulations would have been sufficient absent a consent decree.</text>
            <text>But, because of the nature of the beast, so to speak, that mandatory language is there.</text>
            <text>It buttresses the consent decree, and I believe because of, in essence, the double mandatory language gives this Court a stronger basis to say that in this case there was a liberty interest created by the mandatory language of the consent decree, by the correctional policies and procedures and the language therein.</text>
            <text>Thank you.</text>

          <heading>Rebuttal of Barbara Willett Jones</heading>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>Your Honor, I think it's important to point out that in the consent decree, although the parties did agree to continue open visitation and maintain visitation at their current level, the parties... the attorneys for the Respondents agreed to the procedures that were in place at the time.</text>
            <text>The procedures that were in place at the time were not changed for over six years until the motion was filed.</text>
            <text>Never required any kind of hearing when we denied a visitor.</text>
            <text>And I think that's very important.</text>
            <text>That was also in place at the signing of the consent decree.</text>
            <text>So, there was no requirement agreed to by the parties to have a due process hearing before any party was denied visiting at the institution, and that was in place at the time we signed the consent decree, and that was agreed to by parties on both sides.</text>
            <text>This did not come up until six years later after the consent decree was signed.</text>
            <text>The Court of Appeals did not rule that the consent decree was the motivating force for the finding of the mandatory procedures that gave rise to the rights.</text>
            <text>The Court of Appeals found that it was the procedures themselves that contained the language that gave rise to the liberty interests that requires the implementation of the due process clause.</text>
            <text>And I think, more importantly, it is necessary for this Court to draw the line because of the burden that is going to be imposed on state of officials if this analysis is continued in the manner in which it's being applied below now.</text>

            <text>Just as... I'm curious.</text>
            <text>When a visitor wants to come and visit, do they just show up?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>They just show up?</text>
            <text>There's no writing or anything else?</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And who... and who passes on whether the visitor gets in?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_willett_jones">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Willett Jones</label>
            <text>There's a staff person, a line officer there.</text>
            <text>If the staff person believes that there is some problem, then he notifies the duty officer and the duty officer makes the decision on whether to deny the visit.</text>
            <text>But there is no list of permissible visitors.</text>
            <text>That's what open visitation is.</text>
            <text>Anyone can come during those hours to visit that inmate.</text>
            <text>I think it's limited by numbers and numbers of adults and unlimited children, but they may show up during the hours of visiting.</text>
            <text>Therefore, we request that this Court seriously consider drawing some distinctions between daily management procedures and those procedures which affect substantive nature of confinement, release from confinement and the very duration of confinement.</text>
            <text>Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
