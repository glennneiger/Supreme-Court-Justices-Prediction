          <turn speaker="steven_a_fehr" startTime="9.778" stopTime="581.910">
            <label>Mr. Steven A. Fehr</label>
            <text syncTime="9.778" offset="186158">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.222" offset="211967">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.575" offset="221371">This case involves an award of attorney's fees pursuant to Section 706(k) of Title VII in favor of the settling plaintiffs and against a union when that union was not a defendant and intervened only because the settlement agreement would override the union's contract and impair the seniority rights and job security of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.388" offset="300575">Petitioner IFFA is the labor union which represents TWA's flight attendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.803" offset="322204">In 1970, the union which formerly represented TWA's flight attendants filed charges in this class action suit challenging TWA's practice of terminating all flight attendants who became mothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.951" offset="366821">The class was defined as all flight attendants so terminated from 1965 forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.624" offset="389495">Two months later, the union successfully negotiated the elimination of the "no-mothers" policy pursuant to a new collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.328" offset="420320">The case was settled in 1971, but the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's approval of that settlement because of a conflict of interest it perceived between the union's obligations to the class members on one hand and its duties to represent the incumbent employees on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.961" offset="486880">And it was those same duties, of course, which brought about IFFA's intervention years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.186" offset="507778">But, at that point, in 1973, the union and union counsel were replaced as class representative and class counsel by the parties and counsel who had brought that appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.252" offset="544036">In 1976, the district court held that TWA's policy was indeed illegal and that all plaintiffs had timely claims for the reason that TWA had engaged in the so-called continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.851" offset="594400">The Seventh Circuit reversed again in 1978, holding that while the policy was illegal, TWA had not engaged in a continuing violation, and that the claims of 92 percent of the plaintiffs were therefore time-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.789" offset="650197">In response to a secondary argument made by plaintiffs to the effect that TWA had waived its timeliness defense, the Seventh Circuit said that it need not address that issue because the Title VII time limit was a jurisdictional prerequisite which could not be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.642" offset="709548">The plaintiff sought certiorari on the jurisdictional issue only.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.093" offset="727415">TWA cross-petitioned, but consideration of those petitions was deferred when the parties announced yet another settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.477" offset="752911">Pursuant to this new settlement, the class was divided into two subclasses; Subclass A consisting of the approximately 30 women with timely claims, and Subclass B consisting of the approximately 400 women with untimely claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.865" offset="806514">TWA was to pay $3 million, one half to each subclass.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.720" offset="825949">Counsel fees were to be deducted from the settlement fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.002" offset="839010">Plaintiffs were to be able to regain their jobs and obtain a grant of retroactive competitive seniority from original date of hire through the date the settlement agreement was signed in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.551" offset="881224">And, last but not least, the settlement agreement specifically purported to supersede prior, current, and future collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.925" offset="914766">At that point, in 1979, IFFA, which had come into existence in 1977, intervened to contest the grant of seniority to the class members because of the effect we believed that seniority would have upon the incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.634" offset="969518">As part of our arguments, we contended that if in fact there was no subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of Subclass B, as the Seventh Circuit had already held, then the district court had no power to grant seniority to those individuals and override the collective bargaining agreement on behalf of those plaintiffs with jurisdictionally defective claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.077" offset="1043288">The district court overruled that argument, saying that it need not heed the opinion of the Seventh Circuit finding a lack of jurisdiction for the reason that it was not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.882" offset="1078606">The Seventh Circuit overruled us for an entirely different reason, holding that a district court need not have subject matter jurisdiction to issue orders pursuant to a settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.351" offset="1124477">IFFA petitioned for certiorari, and in March of 1981 our petition was granted on two issues, including the question of whether a district court had power to issue orders pursuant to a settlement agreement in the face of a holding by its court of appeals that jurisdiction was lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.733" offset="1189992">At the same time, however, the court granted the petitions of TWA and plaintiffs which had been held in abeyance since 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.497" offset="1221025">In the Zipes opinion in 1982, the Court chose not to decide the jurisdictional issue we had framed in No. 80-951 but, instead, decided that the Seventh Circuit had been wrong when it had previously held that the Title VII time limit was a jurisdictional prerequisite which could not under any circumstances be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.842" offset="1302423">The Court went on to affirm the orders approving the settlement and granting seniority to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.265" offset="1320081">Now, the primary reason IFFA had fought the grant of seniority was that it feared that the TWA flight attendant work force was about to enter a period where it would not only not expand but actually significantly shrink.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.823" offset="1374312">As it happened, from mid-1979 when the settlement was announced, until mid-1983, TWA furloughed several hundred flight attendants and hired none.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.720" offset="1421959">When expansion finally came, those openings went not to the incumbent furloughees, but to the plaintiffs because of the seniority granted to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.867" offset="1458530">The reentry of hundreds of plaintiffs into the work force blocked the recall of 159 furloughees who eventually dropped off the employment rolls due to a five-year contractual limitation on furlough status.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.407" offset="1512656">And, finally, we get to the subject of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.518" offset="1529061">In 1982 plaintiff's counsel sought and were awarded nearly $1.4 million from the $3 million settlement fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.614" offset="1565528">Of that amount, $1,250,000 was paid for pre-settlement work at a multiplier of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.519" offset="1593113">Meanwhile, the typical Subclass B member who had been away from her job as a flight attendant for 13 to 18 years, received approximately $2,000 in back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.917" offset="1634700">Counsel also sought fees against TWA and IFFA for the litigation in regard to the settlement, and in 1986 the district court denied the request for further fees against TWA, holding that plaintiffs had waived any further fees from TWA in the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.809" offset="1698230">However, the district court assessed fees against IFFA in an amount exceeding $180,000 because, in the view of the district court, prevailing plaintiffs are almost automatically entitled to an award of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.787" offset="1750161">Last year, a divided Seventh Circuit panel affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.411" offset="1760715">All of this Court's decisions regarding civil rights attorney's fees from Piggle Park, to Christiansburg, to Garland last month, make it clear that equitable considerations are paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.180" offset="1815781">As Justice Stewart said in Christiansburg, 706(k) does not even invite, much less require, a mechanical construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.794" offset="1846188">Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to consider the very difficult, perhaps nearly impossible, quandary which IFFA faced when it intervened in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.461" offset="1884849">And that dilemma was brought about not just by the facts I've outlined, but also by the changing state of the law, as best demonstrated by the then very recent decisions of this Court in the Franks case in 1976 and the Teamsters case in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.390" offset="1952558">In Franks, the Court held that successful Title VII plaintiffs are ordinarily entitled to a grant of retroactive competitive seniority unless that seniority will have unusual adverse impact upon the incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.820" offset="2010341">Now, Franks gave us some problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.902" offset="2022671">First, Franks was decided against the background of a final determination of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.836" offset="2046390">The timeliness and violation issues had been finally determined in favor of plaintiff's, as emphasized in Justice Steven's opinion in the Evans case the next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.614" offset="2081499">So, arguably, the Franks standard did not even apply to our situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.694" offset="2093828">Second problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.607" offset="2101456">What is unusual adverse impact?</text>
            <text syncTime="490.927" offset="2110756">Well, we thought the seniority would affect peoples' ability to hold their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.652" offset="2129668">Surely, that is adverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.061" offset="2135311">Arguably, it is the most adverse affect an employee can feel in a Title VII case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.205" offset="2151820">Is it unusual?</text>
            <text syncTime="502.817" offset="2158299">We would certainly hope so.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.217" offset="2163941">And, thus, we thought we could meet the Franks standard even if it applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.740" offset="2177943">But our third problem was the most difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.563" offset="2185257">How do you prove it?</text>
            <text syncTime="511.333" offset="2192362">The standard requires the union or the incumbent employees to present evidence looking forward, evidence which is necessarily speculative and conjectural.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.089" offset="2223396">And, in retrospect, I must say that no one took our speculation seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.083" offset="2247324">In fact, the Seventh Circuit, one year after IFFA's intervention, despite the fact that during that year TWA had furloughed hundreds of flight attendants and hired none... a fact of which the court was aware... overruled our arguments in significant part in reliance upon previous testimony before the district court to the effect that this settlement is no problem, it will not affect the incumbents, as a result of normal expansion and attrition, we can absorb all of these class members in less than one-half year.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.154" offset="2371667">Unfortunately, it did not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.587" offset="2385355">Looking back, obviously, our arguments have more force than they had looking forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="996.037" offset="4131170">In Teamsters, the Court talked about remedial proceedings which involve imprecision and approximation, and the delicate task of adjusting the interest between the discriminatees and the legitimate expectations of the incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.397" offset="4188640">The district court must draw upon qualities of mercy and practicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.430" offset="4204731">And, especially when immediate implementation of an equitable remedy threatens to impinge upon the expectations of innocent parties, the court must look to the realities and necessities inescapably involved in reconciling competing interests in order to determine the special blend of what is fair, necessary, and workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.570" offset="4269306">And, perhaps most interestingly, the Court in Teamsters said, that until evidentiary hearings were held, it was not possible to evaluate abstract claims concerning the equitable balance that should be struck in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.351" offset="4320401">Now, I must confess that I do not know what all that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.300" offset="4336179">And with respect... I'm not sure that anyone does know what that means, except that the plaintiffs and the incumbent employees, nearly always represented by their unions, are going to have to slug it out in complex remedial proceedings and let the district courts carve out the law on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.773" offset="4406083">And we believe that to say that the union must participate in this extremely difficult process, where it cannot possibly be predicted what claims will bring about what results, and yet to say the union shall be subjected to an almost automatic award of attorney's fees if it should not prevail, is simply unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.696" offset="4473792">And it would also... it will also unquestionably cause a severe chilling effect upon the rights of innocent incumbent employees affected as a collateral consequence of Title VII litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.916" offset="4518723">We should also discuss why it is the Court said in Teamsters that the union will remain for the remedy phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.059" offset="4547249">It is, I believe, because in most instances it is only the union which is capable of raising the rights of the incumbent employees, for those claims, most often, are based on a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.238" offset="4591970">It is the duty of the union to enforce that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.141" offset="4599598">And the issue is whether the contract can be overridden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.146" offset="4611615">Which brings us straight to the union's duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.248" offset="4624049">Now, If I may, I would like to talk about how, if IFFA had not intervened, a claim for the duty of fair representation against it might have been structured to simply establish the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.687" offset="4673786">One, the Plaintiffs and Defendant obviously thought it necessary to override the collective bargaining agreement in the settlement to obtain the relief they sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.315" offset="4708268">Two, the union was invited to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.427" offset="4720702">Three, part of the duty of fair representation is a duty to enforce rights contained in a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.939" offset="4746824">Four, the Seventh Circuit was already on record in this case in 1973 lecturing the union about its obligations to the incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.325" offset="4784336">Fifth, you establish that there are damages generally throughout the bargaining unit from the relief granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.621" offset="4813489">And Justice O'Connor's recent opinion in Case 87-548 establishes that with its discussion of how seniority simply dominates the working lives of these flight attendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.429" offset="4852777">And, also, that the very job security of the junior incumbents was at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.963" offset="4870854">And with hindsight, in this case, it would have been very easy to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.306" offset="4884228">And, Sixth, that the Seventh Circuit had held that 92 percent of these plaintiffs had untimely claims which were, for that reason, lacking in merit and also lacking in subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.294" offset="4932189">And then the next question is: where did the union's lawyers go to law school?</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.647" offset="4949639">Don't they know that a federal district court lacking subject matter jurisdiction has no power to do anything but dismiss those claims?</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.402" offset="4976597">Why did you not even try to save these peoples' jobs?</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.076" offset="4991330">Would it have been successful?</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.066" offset="4999272">What would the damages have been?</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.415" offset="5004705">I can't say that, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.889" offset="5014632">But I do know that a compelling argument could have been made that the union abused whatever discretionary powers it had and arbitrarily refused to process the seemingly meritorious claims which involved the very job security of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.799" offset="5066250">But, of course, the duty of fair representation is not just a question of can the union be successfully sued?</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.403" offset="5092686">The union has an affirmative obligation to exercise its best efforts to serve its members' interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.388" offset="5112539">A union's raison d'etre... excuse the pronunciation... is to represent, after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.701" offset="5137825">And if a union has the legal obligation to ensure that its members' interests and rights are asserted, and if the courts are to consider the interests of affected innocent incumbents, again, we believe it is manifestly unjust to punish a union by assessing an automatic award of attorney's fees against the union should it not prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.674" offset="5209714">It would, as the Ninth Circuit said in Richardson, simply punish the union for performing an act which it was under a legal duty to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.760" offset="5238031">Plaintiffs will argue, of course, that fee awards are compensatory and not punitive, but that argument bears a closer analysis for where innocent bystanders are deprived of legitimate rights though they did no wrong, and where the courts compound that injury by saying that if you dare to raise your voice, you will be socked with an additional award of attorney's fees to boot, that award certainly seems punitive in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.105" offset="5327474">And, I would add, that there is no legal basis for the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.798" offset="5338237">Indeed, the entire concept of fee-shifting is rooted in the principle of shifting fees to the party who violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.803" offset="5374286">Even the private attorney's general concept is based upon the notion that those private attorneys generally will prosecute those who violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.308" offset="5408245">We believe the fact that the party against whom fees are sought did not violate the law, by itself constitutes a special circumstance which should dismantle the presumption of a fee award in favor of prevailing plaintiffs, and at least three circuits have specifically so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.270" offset="5472088">Our position is also very much in harmony with, and supported, by this Court's decision in the General Building Contractors case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.494" offset="5496957">I will not repeat here the language from Chief Justice Rehnquist which we quoted and discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.170" offset="5519735">But, in that opinion, the Court also said that there are fundamental limitations on the remedial power of the federal courts, that those powers can be exercised only on the basis of a violation, and extend no farther than required by that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.098" offset="5571458">This principle is not limited to civil rights, but is a controlling principle governing the scope of federal judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.512" offset="5597058">The Court... the Court there held that treating an innocent party, for the purposes of injunctive relief, as if that party had been found liable on the merits was beyond the traditional equitable limitations upon the authority of federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.970" offset="5646899">Similarly, here, the Court should not... we believe cannot... for attorney's fees purposes treat innocent parties in the same fashion as defendants found guilty of violating the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.818" offset="5694338">I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.705" offset="5717848">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.824" offset="5730282">The union and the government seek from this Court the announcement of a rule forbidding district courts from imposing attorney's fees under 706(k) against intervenors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.584" offset="5781378">Or, to put it another way, as they do in some instances, against an intervenor who is innocent of the violation out of which the lawsuit arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.828" offset="5810321">And the union and the government present certain views that they think justify that result and that rule because they think that these matters are matters of sound fairness and considerations of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.557" offset="5865283">They're wrong about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.377" offset="5872493">But, what is more important, the question is what does the statute say because the issue here is what did Congress intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.454" offset="5896839">And we must start by examining the statute to answer the question what did Congress intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.348" offset="5916379">There are three explicit matters contained in 706(k) which bear on this question, each of which shows that Congress had no intention to exempt intervenors from the fee-shifting provision, irrespective of whether the intervenor was guilty of a violation of the law or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.212" offset="5999866">The first of those is the provision of prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.377" offset="6028496">Congress said that fees are authorized to be awarded to the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.652" offset="6053678">There is no question that in this case... nobody disputes that in this case the plaintiffs were the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.827" offset="6078338">Not only in the liability phase of the case against TWA, but against the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.353" offset="6100490">There is no dispute about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.041" offset="6195157">The second significance of the phrase "prevailing party" has to do with what one has in mind when one contemplates that there be a prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.246" offset="6232042">You can prevail only... in a lawsuit only when you prevail against somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.170" offset="6255657">So, for every time there's a prevailing party, there's somebody who lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.523" offset="6269136">And Congress knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.236" offset="6275928">And that image of there being a party opposite the prevailing party is very important because the obvious and logical suggestion is that the person who has to pay the fees of the prevailing party is the person against whom the prevailing party prevailed against.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.293" offset="6376238">And that is the second of the matters which are... or, the third of the three matters which I think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.088" offset="6395360">Congress did not make this fee-shifting mandatory, nor did it prevent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.522" offset="6413123">It left it up to the discretion of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.392" offset="6420646">But I would like to proceed to the next of the three items and then come back to the discretion, which I think is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.707" offset="6445828">The second is... the second part of the statute that we think is very relevant and bears on this point is, the language of the statute that says that the court may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.918" offset="6510717">The reason why that's so important is because costs are awarded to the winning party irrespective of whether the losing party did something wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.217" offset="6551886">In fact... indeed... the statute that governs the costs in this case, 28 U.S.C. 1911 and 1912, deals with the subject of costs that are awarded in proceedings in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.738" offset="10593969">And so, in the case in this setting... the typical Title VII case... you might easily attribute to the defendant the reasonable anticipation that there will be not only litigation about liability but about relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.421" offset="10776721">But I don't think you can expect that TWA would have looked forward to and expect that the union would come in and make arguments about the question of jurisdiction, or that the union would make arguments that had become oeclasse six years earlier in Franks v. Bowman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.454" offset="10844849">What the union came and argued in this case... and what they argued is clear from the Zipes opinion... it's not what the union says they argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.149" offset="10871598">They did not argue unusual adverse impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.192" offset="10879748">They spent two minutes on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.461" offset="10884868">What they argued, and the two things clear from Zipes, are the jurisdictional question... and you can't expect TWA to look forward to that once TWA dropped that cudgel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.378" offset="10924575">And, second, it argued as though Franks v. Bowman had never been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.592" offset="10941397">Argued that, gee, this is going to have an impact on us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.535" offset="10961146">It's an unusual adverse impact that counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.410" offset="10980686">Seniority is important, and it's as important to the incumbents as it was... and to the victims... as it was to the incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.414" offset="11012659">So, when the union argues that what it did was reasonable under these circumstances, they're really missing the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.528" offset="11037110">And the question whether the defendant should be imposed... whether the fee should be imposed on the defendant I think should go to the question of foreseeability, which is inapposite to this case because of the particular facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.988" offset="11091027">And the particular facts of this case are important with respect to this question of discretion and forsee ability to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.394" offset="11120597">The union filed this case originally in 1970 at a time when the union contract was about to expire, and one of the things the union wanted for its incumbents was to end TWA's no-mothers policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.293" offset="11176186">They filed this lawsuit to bring pressure on TWA, but filed it not only on behalf of the incumbents in order to try and stop a practice from continuing... which, of course, the incumbents had an interest in... but filed to as the purported class representative on behalf of all previously fired stewardesses, stewardesses who were no longer members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.587" offset="11269391">And, the complaint prayed... among its prayers to relief was back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.403" offset="11288617">The way the union settled the case with TWA was they eliminated the policy for the future and got virtually nothing for the class members whose claims they had used in the bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.030" offset="11335115">So, they brought the threat of back pay claims and the other kinds of equitable relief that the prior stewardesses might have enjoyed, used that as a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.176" offset="11371686">Once they got what they wanted, virtually abandoned the class members in a settlement in which the class members would... the previous stewardesses would have gotten no back pay, would not even have had a right to get their jobs back except as openings occurred, and would get not only no retroactive competitive seniority, but, to the delight of TWA, no retroactive company seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.363" offset="11468444">And it was with that, and the fact that, as the Seventh Circuit noted, that they didn't... they being TWA and the union... did not even give the right to opt out to the previously-fired stewardesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.312" offset="11520271">They wanted to run this settlement through in a way so that there wasn't even any opt-out provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.936" offset="11538766">That's why the Seventh Circuit vacated the order approving that settlement and remanded with instructions to remove the union as a class representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.244" offset="11580039">And then the union was not heard from again until five or six years later, 1979, when after we had obtained summary judgment and we had brought TWA to the bargaining table while cross-petitions for certiorari were--</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.735" offset="12857949">We just think that where there is some question as to the validity of the claims that it's the wrongdoing party that should bear the burden for fees, and, to the extent possible, for the relief encompassed in the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.616" offset="12905492">There is nothing in the legislative history that requires the result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.000" offset="12947079">The only thing in the legislative history about 706(k) is the brief statement by Senator Humphrey that we want to make it easier for plaintiffs of limited means to bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.137" offset="12979575">That has certainly happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.259" offset="12984068">That certainly cannot be a basis for finding that intervenors whose rights are abridged, even though they did not violate the law, should be automatically assessed attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.134" offset="13019595">And, of course, as you indicated, Mr. Chief Justice, there is a problem with saying the Court exercised discretion because in case after case, from Christiansburg to Piggy Park to Garland to Bergeron, the Court has told the district courts how they are to exercise their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.425" offset="13072676">And if the fact that the party did not violate the law is to be a factor to be considered, there has to be a reversal because I think it is clear from both lower court opinions that that was not considered to be an appropriate factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.454" offset="13120846">As to whether the union was a plaintiff or defendant, look at Rule 24 which says a party who intervenes shall present a short pleading presenting either its claim or defense, and then look at our petition for intervention in the Joint Appendix, and see whether it represents a claim or a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.703" offset="13181868">I think it clearly is a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.115" offset="13187510">We were setting forth the fact that we believed the incumbent employees were being victimized and that that should not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.600" offset="13213423">As to our opposing complete relief, the only sense in which we did that is in an effort to save the junior incumbents' jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.497" offset="13244979">We pointed out to the district court that there had been a finding that there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.900" offset="13258668">It was the duty of the court, I always understood, to inquire into whether he had subject matter jurisdiction and the duties of officers of the court to insist in that endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.296" offset="13296179">I take it Mr. Hartunian is not grateful to the former union for setting events in motion which eventually allowed plaintiffs' counsel to receive the $1.4 million in fees, but I do disagree as to whether the parties were better off under the second settlement than they would have if the first settlement had been consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.388" offset="13368591">And I have no quarrel with the 1973 Seventh Circuit opinion, but the fact is that the parties waited an additional 12 years to regain their jobs and the average Subclass B, you'll remember, received the grand sum of $2,000 in back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.457" offset="13420836">The average class member received just about the same seniority she would have had if the first settlement had been consummated because of the limitation upon the accrual of seniority in the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.785" offset="13462214">It is true that the first settlement required that the plaintiffs only be reemployed when openings occurred, as old the second settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.771" offset="13498158">However, the difference is that settlements were plentiful in 1971 and nonexistent in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.808" offset="13530237">As to the settlement agreement... or, the district court granting the seniority, but for the settlement agreement, obviously the district court could not have granted the seniority because the law of the case was and is that there was a finding that Subclass B members had untimely claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.620" offset="13605469">And, but for the settlement agreement, he would not possibly have been empowered to issue that grant of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.743" offset="13630024">I think that's all I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.236" offset="13639951">I thank you.</text>
