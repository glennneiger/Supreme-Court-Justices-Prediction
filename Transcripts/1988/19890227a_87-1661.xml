            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Gribbon</label>
            <text syncTime="11.939" offset="194600">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.641" offset="205362">We turn in this case from hard rock music to hard rock metals.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.109" offset="227201">At issue is the validity of an Arizona statute which provides that minerals in federally granted lands shall be leased upon payable... upon payment of a royalty of 5 percent on the net value of the minerals actually extracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.839" offset="302120">The court below held that that statute was invalid because it failed to provide for prior appraisal of the properties and leasing at appraised value, which procedures the court below held were required by the Enabling Act of 1910 pursuant to which Arizona was admitted to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.920" offset="382472">The issue is not, I hasten to say, whether Arizona shall be permitted to give away its minerals or to lease them on fire sale basis such as is alleged in some of the briefs, nor is it a matter of invoking basic trust principles in support of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.464" offset="456660">That decision, which was made on cross motions for summary judgment, contain no finding that Arizona had been profligate or wasteful in its handling of its minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.903" offset="498456">There could have been no finding because there was no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.705" offset="509637">The court found purely as a matter of statutory construction that the Enabling Act of 1910 required that mineral leasing be done on the basis of prior appraisal and leasing at appraised value.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.631" offset="565330">The issue arises in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.150" offset="575361">In 1910, Congress granted to Arizona substantial acreage of Federal land when it entered the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.320" offset="604095">It provided in that grant that Arizona and New Mexico, who was party to the same Act, could not dispose of the federally granted lands except after advertising, auction and appraisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.164" offset="659475">That grant in 1910 excluded mineral lands, which was the custom of all of the Federal grants with one exception at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.603" offset="697196">No mineral lands were granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.622" offset="705241">They were reserved and administered under the Federal leasing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.174" offset="723527">Some 17 years later, Congress provided in the Jones Act that not only Arizona, but the other 11 western states should now receive the numbered mineral sections that had been withheld from them in the original 1910 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.218" offset="791655">The Jones Act said nothing about dispositional restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.837" offset="806179">It did provide that the minerals could not be sold, but they could be leased as the state legislature would direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.628" offset="845258">In 1936, Congress amended the Enabling Act of 1910 to provide that Arizona could lease the minerals, the so-called hidden minerals, in lands which were not known to be mineral at the time of the grant.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="190.387" offset="908370">Strictly speaking, you mean lease the mineral lands, rather than lease the minerals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_gribbon" startTime="194.708" stopTime="424.607">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Gribbon</label>
            <text syncTime="194.708" offset="925610">Minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.074" offset="927073">Lease the mineral land, yes, Your Honor, for... for the use the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.076" offset="943060">And the 1936 Act, as I say, provided that Arizona could lease the mineral lands which were given to it somewhat inadvertently by the 1910 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.103" offset="1003246">These were lands which were not known to be mineral at the time and, therefore, were not excluded, but which this Court in a series of decisions in the 1920s said had passed to Arizona and New Mexico, nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.728" offset="1049744">Now, Arizona and New Mexico both had adopted basically the Federal leasing procedures for the hidden minerals and had not provided for appraisement, advertising and auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.420" offset="1108468">In 1941, pursuant to the authorizations that had been given it by these two earlier Federal Acts, Arizona enacted the statute that is attacked here which provides for a flat 5 percent royalty on extracted minerals and does not provide for auction, advertising and appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.234" offset="1195717">This action... I might say at this point that that statute passed in 1941 has ever been attacked by the Attorney General of the United States who has the duty under the Act to enforce it and has what this Court has referred to as an ongoing oversight responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.147" offset="1271367">This action was brought by three taxpayers in Arizona and by the Arizona Teachers Association which consists of... whose members are 20,000 public school teachers in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.836" offset="1314104">The claim is that the dispositional restrictions, at least the appraisal restriction, in the 1910 Act limit Arizona's authority to lease minerals since the statute does not provide it is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.180" offset="1367498">It... they further allege in the complaint that had Arizona provided for appraisal and appraising at the... leasing at the appraised value, more revenues would have come in from the mineral lands... from the leasing of the mineral lands, and that those revenues would have either or both reduced the taxes that the taxpayers were paying for the support of the schools, or improve the quality of education by infusing more money into the public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.449" offset="1484631">I shall first address two contentions the Solicitor General has made as to why the Court should let the decision below stand and not review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.138" offset="1523397">The first suggestion is that the Respondents, on whose side the Solicitor General appears, lack standing in an Article III sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.410" offset="1560386">So far as the teachers are concerned, there does not seem to be any real question that these teachers have a particularized interest in the public school system of which they are such an integral part, and that if they are right in their complaint, they have been injured by an improper failure of the state to put more money into the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.109" offset="1651188">The claim, as far as the teachers are concerned, seems to be that they are unable to claim with the requisite certainty that the redress they ask... that is, invalidation of the statute... will give them the relief that would take care of the quality of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.701" offset="1713568">In this respect, we believe that the Solicitor General misconceives the basic principle which, as was recently stated in Bryant v Yellen, is not that someone who has been injured need to established with certainty that the relief he seeks is going to give him what he wants, but that there must merely be a reasonable expectation of that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.484" offset="1800712">And we would submit that from the teachers' point of view, there is that reasonable expectation that if they're right and if more money comes in, the quality of education is going to be improved in the State of Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.235" offset="3647779">In that... as to that, we believe that that represents a misconception as to what was decided below and what remains to be decided now.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.923" offset="3682469">The Solicitor General says there remains to be cited the... whether the leases that Petitioners have are void.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.415" offset="3728445">Respondents, in bringing their suit, never asked for any kind of a determination as to the voidability of these leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.969" offset="3754672">It is not a decision... it is not an issue that should come up before the court below on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.706" offset="3777659">When the... when the Arizona Supreme Court held in Respondents' favor, it gave them everything they asked for, a declaratory judgment that the royalty provision was invalid, and said they could have an injunction against further leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.596" offset="3829173">Now, on remand, the Superior Court has entered the injunction holding that the leasing statute... the royalty provision is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.369" offset="3864281">It has not gone further and enjoined further leases presumably because the state has said they are not going to issue and they have not issued any new leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.510" offset="3904824">And the state... and the court has held up action pending a... an attempt by all the parties to work out legislation which would take care of what the Arizona court has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.735" offset="3949754">And the holders of the... of the present leases are continuing to operate the mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.187" offset="3967517">They are continuing to pay money, to pay the royalties of the 5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.139" offset="3979325">And there is an agreement with the state that if and when the legislature acts pursuant to this Arizona statute, any new financial arrangements will be made retroactive to January 1, 1988, which is essentially the date of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.498" offset="4040765">But no proposal was made to the lower court on remand that the leases be voided.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.902" offset="4062394">We, therefore, think that this is within the exceptions spelled out in Cox Broadcasting where the Court will hear... review state court judgments even though some ministerial or pre-ordained things need to be... happen such as you decided in the Duquesne Light case here a couple of weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.431" offset="4136477">I turn now to the substantive issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.016" offset="4146822">The validity of this statute depends upon a proper interpretation of four Federal statutes which were passed between 1910 and 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.988" offset="4178796">The first of these is the Enabling Act to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.023" offset="4194887">It does not include a grant of minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.225" offset="4207739">We believe that there was no occasion for Congress to consider whether the dispositional restrictions that it imposed in 1910 were appropriate and should be applied to minerals simply because Congress, in accordance with its practice since 1985, had not granted any minerals and did not have any occasion to consider what, if any, kind of procedures should follow the leasing of minerals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.815" offset="4338038">So, we believe that we have to look elsewhere to the three other Acts, or principally to the Jones Act, to determine whether these restrictions... and I might note that these restrictions were... were more rigorous than those imposed on any of the other states because prior to 1910, some of the states, and New Mexico when it was a territory, had behaved in a way that the Congress thought was irresponsible, either negligent or possibly fraudulent in disposing of resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.066" offset="4451096">So, they took it out on New Mexico and Arizona and imposed these three dispositional restrictions on them in 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.302" offset="4475965">We come to 1927, the Jones Act, which was a landmark change on the part of Federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.523" offset="4500938">For the first time, the Federal Government gave up the mineral wealth in 12 western states and gave it to each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.879" offset="4530299">And it provided at that time that, first, the states could not sell the mineral wealth, but they could lease them as the individual state legislatures would provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.520" offset="4576902">Now, there was in 1927, unlike 1910, no concern about states' responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.924" offset="4598531">The western states had grown up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.241" offset="4603756">They had achieved maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.710" offset="4609607">They had political muscle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.243" offset="4615772">It was all a question of how right it was to transfer this mineral wealth to the western states because the eastern states already had it right from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.231" offset="4647746">Our opponents take... take the position that four or five words in the granting clause of the Jones Act, these words being these grants</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.414" offset="4944497">"shall be of the same effect. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.658" offset="4705424">as the 1910 Act... that those words incorporate by reference all of the dispositional restrictions in the 1910 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.847" offset="4742205">We believe that that puts much too great a load on those four or five words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.668" offset="4765506">In the first place, this paragraph, Section A in which these words appear, was not even in the bill until after both Houses of Congress had agreed on the substance of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.023" offset="4806884">It was put in at the suggestion of the Secretary of the Interior who was concerned that there might be a necessity for patents or some other procedures, and wanted to have it made clear that the title would pass ipso facto, so to speak, when the legislation was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.950" offset="4858606">Furthermore, this is a granting section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.283" offset="4867906">It isn't a restriction section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.352" offset="4876161">The restrictions are in the next section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.354" offset="4884206">And if these words mean what the court below and Respondents say they mean, there will be a... a real conflict with the following section which does contain restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.710" offset="4921614">Those restrictions are that all of the money that is obtained be used for the support of the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.947" offset="4942616">If</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.316" offset="4952020">means what the Respondents say it does, that was already taken care of because that was provided in the 1910 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.533" offset="4972918">There was no need to put it in again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.669" offset="4981486">Secondly, Subsection A contains a very important restriction... restriction that the minerals may not be sold by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.789" offset="5009908">Now, that isn't to the same effect of the 1910 Act because the 1910 Act and all of the enabling acts permitted sales under various conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.229" offset="5043762">So, this is in direct contrast to the same effect meaning that the Respondents and the court below would ask for.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.832" offset="6074136">The Jones Act didn't cover them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.232" offset="6079674">The Jones Act was limited to the numbered mineral sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.617" offset="6093258">And nothing covered the states of... the... Arizona's authority to lease these hidden minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.937" offset="6118544">Now, Arizona and New Mexico had, ever since the time of the 1910 Act, been leasing these hidden minerals, and they had been doing it without appraisal, without advertising, without auction, basically in accordance with established Federal procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.051" offset="6402966">What they suggest rather is that the Arizona constitution has been interpreted in a subsequent case down in Arizona, Deer Valley, which doesn't involve minerals and doesn't involve leasing, as going further than the enabling acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.376" offset="6456255">Now, that is somewhat contrary to the perceived learning which was the Enabling Act which was... which required the constitution provisions meant the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.732" offset="6493767">But what they're saying is not that this decision has an adequate state ground, but maybe sometime in the future, if the Arizona court ever gets around to this, they might apply in the mineral leasing situation the kind of reasoning they did in Deer Valley.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.620" offset="6621245">The court... the Arizona court reasoned entirely from the legislative history and the Federal legislation as to what the meaning of both the Enabling Acts and the Arizona constitution was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.345" offset="6668161">I mention it with respect to the 1936 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.063" offset="6687073">New Mexico's right to lease minerals in such manner as its legislature has seen fit had been confirmed by the Congress way back in 1928 at about the time Congress was passing the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.223" offset="6739736">A case had been decided in... in the New Mexico Supreme Court, Neel v. Barker, which said that the dispositional restrictions of the 1910 Act did not affect mineral leasing on the hidden lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.780" offset="6789891">And the Congress of 1928 passed a resolution saying, yes, that's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.684" offset="6809535">We'll send it back and let New Mexico decide by a plebiscite whether it wants to have its legislature do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.672" offset="6833464">So, New Mexico had been freed since 1928 from any of these restrictions in the... in the Mineral Leasing Act... in so... in the 1910 Act insofar as mineral leasing was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.980" offset="6878708">The 1936 Act was directed only at freeing Arizona in the same way... not in the same way, but to the same extent that Arizona had already been freed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.001" offset="7014753">Now, the Arizona legislature has accommodated those two rather modest differences by providing in its statute that... that all Federal lands, however they came about, shall be leased in a way that would take care of the requirements of the Jones Act and the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.078" offset="7079119">They cannot be sold, and the leases are limited to 20 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.482" offset="7108690">I will mention finally the 1951 Act on which the Respondents rely importantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.684" offset="7129483">The important thing about that Act is that it did not impose any dispositional restrictions either on hard rock minerals, which are what we're talking about here, or on hydrocarbon minerals which, for the first time, were set up as a separate regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.146" offset="7191341">And, therefore, it is improper to make any kind of an inference from that act of legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.076" offset="7287054">Before I address the merits, I'd like to turn to a jurisdictional issue that was raised before the recess, namely, the presence of an independent and adequate state law grounds for the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.633" offset="7337313">As was noted, the Arizona Supreme Court based its decision not only on the Federal Enabling Act, but also on the Arizona constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.139" offset="7371377">And while we realize that under Michigan v. Long, there is a presumption that the Federal ground is controlling, presumptions can be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.512" offset="7408889">And there are several factors that we think do rebut that presumption in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.082" offset="7427175">First of all, the decision below by the Arizona Supreme Court refers to the Arizona constitution on at least nine separate occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.921" offset="7462492">The remand order states specifically that the trial court shall enter a judgment declaring the statute "unconstitutional and invalid".</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.443" offset="7500526">And we then have the subsequent decision that was mentioned by Mr. Gribbon, the Deer Valley decision, by the Arizona Supreme Court where that court declared that in its view the Arizona constitution imposes trust restrictions independent of and more stringent than those in the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.274" offset="7579939">And finally, we have the amicus brief now from the State of Arizona itself taking the position that they believe... the State of Arizona now believes that the Arizona constitution prohibits this royalty statute and... as an independent basis, and that any decision by this Court under the Enabling Act on this statute would, in the state's words, be "purely academic".</text>

            <text syncTime="2225.158" offset="9047393">And the broad exemption that the mines are asking for here completely files in the face of those goals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2563.214" offset="10399700">In that amendment, Congress authorized the state to enter into a variety of leases all in a manner to be made... t to be determined by the legislature, grazing leases, agricultural leases, oil and gas leases, and mineral leases, all in a manner to be determined by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.275" offset="10471903">But critically, it then went on and specifically exempted only oil and gas leases from the requirement for an appraisal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.466" offset="10628637">--Well, Your Honor, certainly it shows that, but I'm not sure that it shows only that because in 1936 oil and gas leases were treated as a subset of mineral leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.810" offset="10682032">And, therefore, in order to exempt oil and gas leases from the appraisal requirement, Congress had to specifically and deliberately separate the treatment of those two kinds of leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.534" offset="10732918">So, I think it says more than simply what Congress thought all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.104" offset="10755175">Beyond that, what... what the mines base most of their argument on in this case is the notion that in allowing the states to determine the manner of leasing, Arizona was somehow being authorized to... to have completely free reign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.649" offset="10833437">But this Court in Alamo Land and Cattle Company... the Alamo Land and Cattle Company case only about 12 years ago, applied the true value and appraisal requirements to grazing leases which, like mineral leases, are authorized in a manner as to be determined by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.545" offset="10905013">And, indeed, every other court that has addressed this question has concluded that congressional directions to allow the states to determine the method or manner of leasing is not a waiver of trust restrictions, but rather an allowance for the state to set the details of leasing, things like the term and the method of appraisal and the duration of leases and other details of which there are many in these leasing situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.464" offset="11016608">Now, beyond... beyond the specifics, I think it's fair to ask, having gone to all of this trouble to put all of these explicit trust restrictions around these trust lands so that the schools would get all the benefit, why would Congress then turn around and exempt one of the most valuable resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.227" offset="11103752">And the only explanation the mines have to offer is that mineral leases are supposedly impossible to appraise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.816" offset="11134055">But the simple fact is that this Court ruled in 1890 that mineral interests were appraisable although it's somewhat more difficult than other interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.105" offset="11175224">And, in fact, it used the same language to authorize other kinds of leases, none of which are claimed to be difficult to appraise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.416" offset="11332481">But, in any event, we think the legislative history throughout is pretty conclusive that Congress always intended these lands to be used for the schools and that... and that the grant, for example, under the Jones Act was a grant confirming and by its own terms extending the prior grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.877" offset="11406355">And the legislative history talks repeatedly about desiring to effectuate the purposes of the original grants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.759" offset="11505829">And that is inconsistent not only with the specific appraisal requirement, but also with the basic trust duty that the state has as a trustee to optimize revenue and to prevent the loss of trust assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.608" offset="11601228">Their only response on that question is that there must be some sort of a finding below in that kind of case before you can find a breach of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.797" offset="11638009">But the cases are quite numerous in which courts have found these kinds of statutory limits on trust returns to be facially a breach of trust because they limit the ability of the trustee to maximize revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.759" offset="11697881">And, indeed, no other state has a non-negotiable, fixed royalty rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.345" offset="11728184">And certainly no private trustee would set a cap on what he or she could collect in interest on trust investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.868" offset="11762247">That is not consistent in any way with basic trust responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.089" offset="11787116">In conclusion, as I mentioned before, to say this statute is allowable is to say that the State of Arizona can literally give away trust minerals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.051" offset="11850959">The statutory formula requires the state to give away minerals where the net value or the costs of production exceed the value of the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.989" offset="11894740">And that cannot be what Congress had in mind when it provided these lands for the purpose of benefiting the schools of Arizona.</text>
