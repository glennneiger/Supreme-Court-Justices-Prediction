            <text syncTime="1888.888" offset="7707909">There are... there was a period of three months where the institutional attorneys assigned to that facility did not even appear at the institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.937" offset="7816161">In fact, the record shows that Mr. Giarratano filed a grievance concerning the lack of assistance for Mr. Boggs and for Mr. Watkins, and that that grievance was ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.959" offset="7856285">In fact, neither of those inmates even had a complete trial transcript, and the institutional attorney did not even attempt to obtain Mr. Boggs' transcript during the pendency of this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.206" offset="8245196">Now, in a normal... and this is what is critically different about death penalty litigation... in a normal case where an inmate has a term of years to prepare his habeas petition, two and a half hours twice a week may give him enough time to prepare a petition over the course of a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.835" offset="8311756">This inmate is going to be dead in 90 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.729" offset="8691367">He made the motion at that time for appointment of counsel, and the circuit court judge denied the motion on the very specific grounds that it is not available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.803" offset="9139628">As part of that, I wanted to point out, and again in the record, and emphasize that this was tried on the facts, and there is an ample factual record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.543" offset="9186544">Of course, we have been through Mr. Washington's requests for counsel when he appeared in front of the trial judge, and it should also be noted that Mr. Washington has an I.Q. of 69.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.601" offset="9238789">In addition, it should be noted that contrary to counsel's suggestions this morning, the Attorney General did not join in the motion in front of the circuit court judge when Mr. Washington made the request for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.261" offset="9289467">In fact, the attorney who was present was silent through that, and sat silently while Mr. Washington was denied that appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.550" offset="9334606">Although in the original trial record we were dependent upon the order that is part of the Appendix, just the other day the State lodged with this court the actual trial transcript of the hearing in which Mr. Washington was denied counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.959" offset="9388210">And the Court will see that in fact our scenario of what happened there is very accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.463" offset="9410257">In addition, however, Mr. Giarratano had talked to the institutional attorney specifically about helping Mr. Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.700" offset="9435230">The institutional attorney did nothing to assist him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.219" offset="9449336">Subsequently, of course, Mr. Washington was transferred to the State penitentiary, and the general rule for the institutional attorneys at the State penitentiary is that these, the assistance they are to provide, is not intended to be very complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.479" offset="9502312">Indeed, the general rule is that they are only supposed to devote one hour to an inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.114" offset="9520912">In fact, while Mr. Washington was there, the institutional attorneys did not visit the institution and did not know... did not know... that Mr. Washington was present, despite the fact that he continued to indicate, and the Attorney General knew, that Mr. Washington wanted to proceed with habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.409" offset="9590084">In addition, Mr. Kulp, the senior Attorney General in charge of capital litigation, testified at trial that they would indeed have executed Mr. Washington even though no papers were filed on his behalf, and even though no volunteer attorney was forthcoming, and clearly even though no institutional attorney was brought down to assist him, and even though clearly he had no access to a law library.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.291" offset="9689558">Mr. Giarratano also filed a grievance concerning Mr. Watkins and Mr. Boggs, the intervenor plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.397" offset="9726025">And Mr. Boggs and Mr. Watkins remained without any assistance from the institutional attorney for a year, even during the pendency of this lawsuit... so even while they knew that this was at issue, for a year they remained without any assistance, and indeed the institutional attorney visited them at their cell, obtained part of the record, and did nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.226" offset="9809303">As I indicated before, in the case of one of them, he did not even attempt to get the completed transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.880" offset="9831978">At trial, Judge Merhige asked him about that, and he said, well, at some point I am going to have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.432" offset="9850159">Now, the only reason that this dragged on for this year was because this case was pending at the trial level, and so no one proceeded to set execution dates for Mr. Boggs and Mr. Watkins while they were receiving none of this assistance, because of the pendency of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.426" offset="9910136">However, it is clear from prior practice, and it is clear from the experience of Mr. Washington that had this case not been pending, and even though they were receiving no assistance, that the State would have proceeded to set execution dates and would have proceeded in fact to execute them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.083" offset="9968755">In addition, we have the instance of Mr. Evans, Wilbur Evans, who proceeded Mr. Washington on Death Row.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.970" offset="9992265">Mr. Evans got as far as three days before being executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.224" offset="10013268">He, too, was in the Death House of the penitentiary, and a volunteer lawyer appeared and filed papers on Mr. Evans' behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.980" offset="10040330">What is significant about that is that subsequently, as part of Mr. Evans' habeas petition, the State confessed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.134" offset="10072931">His sentence was reversed not merely because he won through litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.503" offset="10086410">The State actually confessed error in Mr. Evans' case, and yet they were prepared to execute him at that point, even though he had no assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.560" offset="10126639">Mr. Giarratano, in addition, while he was in isolation asked for the assistance of the institutional attorney, and also asked for access to the law library.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.230" offset="10157359">He was refused as to both of those.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.685" offset="10279194">There is another particular factor that supports the district court's decision that makes death penalty litigation completely different from other litigation, and that is the procedural need to obtain stays in order to litigate your claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.278" offset="10345545">I mean, you cannot have meaningful access if you do not obtain a stay in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.931" offset="10364144">And Justice Scalia has questioned the relevance of this last 15 day period when he was at Mecklenburg before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.871" offset="10395909">I would suggest two responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.921" offset="10404059">Which... the first one is, of course, that they were not receiving access while they were at Mecklenburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.441" offset="10426211">But the other is that it may well be that once... even if he has received some assistance prior that it is necessary to obtain a stay, and it may very well be within that last 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.833" offset="10467694">Now, something critical happens here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.899" offset="10476053">The attorney who is providing the advice at Mecklenburg, and is allegedly helping to prepare these papers, even though in fact we know they do not... he gives up jurisdiction over this inmate when this inmate is transferred to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.858" offset="10531850">So even assuming that he is beginning to work on this case, he throws up his hands as soon as the inmate leaves and is sent to the penitentiary, and now, 15 days prior, an institutional attorney who is supposed to devote one hour to a case, who has no prior knowledge of this inmate, now must pick up the ball, presumably, somehow, even though there is no explanation for this, get the work product of the institutional attorney at Mecklenburg, if there is any, and proceed to obtain this stay and get this habeas petition filed if it has not been filed already.</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.906" offset="11648010">--Well, I think within the standard definitions of what one is allowed to... the basis of a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.476" offset="11674342">If we determined that as to a particular inmate, he was not receiving access, then indeed it would be our obligation as class counsel to file an appropriate motion with the district court to indicate that this inmate was not receiving that counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.801" offset="11727632">Nothing can prevent anyone from filing a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.788" offset="11743514">I think the legitimate concern... the legitimate concern is whether or not the ability of the inmate to make a claim that he is not receiving access will result in additional proceedings and a delay of the execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.679" offset="11799103">That is what this court has repeatedly indicated it has a problem with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.316" offset="11813627">The question is not whether he can file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.466" offset="11822299">The question is whether or not he can stave off the execution by doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.387" offset="11837973">We know, in fact, from Mr. Whitley's case that he failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.505" offset="11850407">He was executed on schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.055" offset="11856677">That would seem to be the concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.874" offset="11863886">Now, the problem here is that what is being raised are problems which the State has within its power to prevent... that is, rather than simply doing what they did, which was in response to the judge's order, which was issuing this memorandum to State circuit court judges and then throwing up their hands as to any further responsibility... if they set up a system which indeed assured that these institutional attorneys would assist, that had some monitoring aspect of it, then indeed they could avoid the very problems that the Court is concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.160" offset="11985094">The reason that those problems potentially exist is that Virginia has been totally non-responsive to the district court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.880" offset="12007978">In fact, what is interesting in this case from the papers filed that are part of the Appendix, that were filed in the Fourth Circuit in connection with the motion to stay the mandate is that even in response to the district court's order, what it required was that I had to repeatedly write letters to the circuit court judges reminding them of Judge Merhige's order, and asking them to appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.830" offset="12103690">They did absolutely nothing to effectuate the order of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.781" offset="12119573">So, these theoretical problems are within the power of the State to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.935" offset="12136187">The mention... one of the problems that we have here is that death penalty litigation does not necessarily proceed on the orderly course on which other litigation proceeds, and this Court is well aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.176" offset="12185088">One of the problems is that if a stay is denied by a State circuit court judge, it is necessary to proceed at a higher level State court, or in Federal court, in order to obtain a stay in order to litigate those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.151" offset="12237019">If you do not have an attorney monitoring that, bringing the motion for a stay to the attention of the judge... indeed, in Virginia, circuit court judges still circuit-ride.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.691" offset="12279129">We have under the code circuits that have 10 separate counties and two judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.512" offset="12302430">There is no automatic provision for any of these filings to be brought to the attention of the circuit court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.749" offset="12323432">Indeed, if the order is entered, the inmate has no way to even know that it has been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.451" offset="12338165">He has no basis for knowing at what point it is necessary for him to prepare and file papers either in the Virginia Supreme Court or in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.557" offset="12374632">None of this can be done without an attorney, and it is applicable only to death penalty cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.844" offset="12515798">The district court envisioned that that State habeas attorney would in fact file the petition in Federal court and the Federal court would then appoint and the Federal Government would pay for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.167" offset="12761036">The first point that I would like to correct is the suggestion that was made here this morning that there was somewhere in the line of 90 to 180 days between the time of sentencing and the time of execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.540" offset="12806593">The average time in Virgin between the imposition of sentence and execution is roughly seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.212" offset="12837209">The average time for getting a conviction affirmed in the Virgin Supreme Court is eight months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.616" offset="12858838">This is not a rush to judgement in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.485" offset="12870332">On the matter of Mr. Washington's motion for appointment of counsel in the circuit court, the record does show that seven weeks after this court denied cert on his direct appeal, he appeared in the circuit court for purposes of setting an execution date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.210" offset="12913277">He appeared with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.093" offset="12920801">His attorney asked the court to appoint counsel to represent him, telling the court that he knew his client was not entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.481" offset="12950371">He also represented to the court that a volunteer group, the ACLU, was looking to find an attorney to represent Mr. Washington, and he represented to the court that there was going to be an attorney out there... a volunteer attorney out there... to file a subsequent habeas corpus action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.741" offset="13011393">The trial court denied the motion at that time, and indicated that he was leaving the matter open, because he anticipated there was going to be future activity to request a stay, or some other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.883" offset="13059981">This is not a matter of the trial court saying there is no availability of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.668" offset="13075132">This is simply a matter of the trial court denying a motion on the understanding that was given to him that volunteer counsel was going to appear.</text>
