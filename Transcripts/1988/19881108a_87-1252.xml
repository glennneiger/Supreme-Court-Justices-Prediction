            <label>Mr. Mark Reinhardt</label>
            <text syncTime="46.435" offset="317594">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="48.825" offset="327207">This case is a review of the dismissal of Petitioners' complaint brought under 18 U.S.C. 1961 and 1968, commonly known as RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.180" offset="364615">The specific acts alleged in our complaint were a series of bribes carried out by Northwestern Bell Telephone Company affecting a number of different Northwestern Bell charges ranging from pay phone rates to the cost of buying home telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.549" offset="422084">These bribes, carried out over a period of years, involved various Bell officials, agents, passing over $140,000 to members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.185" offset="468582">The Public Utilities Commission is the rate setting, semi or quasi-judicial body in Minnesota that sets Bell's rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.120" offset="496376">As pointed out in footnote 1 at page 4 of our brief, a later commission discovered this activity of Bell and reopened one of the many affected rates because of this undue influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.348" offset="549248">They cut that tainted rate of $57 million by over $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.596" offset="570251">This discussion should be broken into three parts: first, the Eighth Circuit's multiple scheme dismissal of this case should be reversed; second, what is a pattern of racketeering activity'; and third, a brief discussion of amici's organized crime connection argument which we submit should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.854" offset="659276">First, this Court should reject the Eighth Circuit's multiple scheme requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.758" offset="678920">Nowhere in the plain words of the statute, or indeed, in the legislative history, do we find the words "multiple schemes".</text>
            <text syncTime="146.207" offset="716641">Pattern is defined in statute 1961 as two acts of racketeering activity, not two schemes, just two acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="757705">There's no multiplicity of schemes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.733" offset="770767">Indeed, a reading of 1962, the operative portion of the RICO statute, shows the impossibility of the Eighth Circuit's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.400" offset="809428">1962 forbids a pattern of, forbids a person of acquiring an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.928" offset="851537">In other words, there is a pattern plus the goal of acquiring an interest in this enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.473" offset="873794">These two together form a single scheme, as do all schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.111" offset="888318">You have a pattern--</text>

            <text syncTime="208.292" offset="965013">Those acts could, in certain limited situations, be part of one transaction, although the word "transaction" is hardly self-defining.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.474" offset="1013810">How do we, how do we give meaning to the continuity requirement that Congress clearly intended to have a role in the pattern inquiry?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Reinhardt</label>
            <text syncTime="231.422" offset="1057591">Your Honor, I think continuity can be thought of, of course, as a series, as you just pointed out, a number of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.170" offset="1088520">However, I believe it also has within it the threat of being a series, and a prime example is the Watchmaker case cited in our brief where some Hell's Angels shot some police officers in one incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.101" offset="1144318">There were two or perhaps three acts in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.444" offset="1157692">There was no other acts or transactions that could be pointed to, but it was clear that through the Hell's Angels enterprise that these acts were committed so as to allow for the threat of continuity or for continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.436" offset="1221640">So in certain very limited situations you can have two acts that do allow for a threat of continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.513" offset="1249957">And if that answers your question--</text>

            <text syncTime="327.790" offset="1443054">However, as I pointed out, it would write out of the law or... well, let me point out, 1962(b) forbids always only a single scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.614" offset="1486313">If we need multiple schemes, we would have written out of the law 1962(b), if we follow this multiple scheme restriction placed upon the word "pattern" by the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.922" offset="1531557">Furthermore, even if multiple schemes were not a legal impossibility under 1962(b), there is little merit in the concept as, well, Respondent would argue it is a bright line test.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.570" offset="1598117">Rather, it becomes a semantical game: do we in this case have a series of bribes committed by different Bell employees against different commissioners affecting different rates, involving different methods, or do we have one scheme to fix rates?</text>
            <text syncTime="383.486" offset="1665826">It's really all in the way that you look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.016" offset="1675962">The Eighth Circuit, in fact, in the criminal case, Kragness, found multiple schemes where somebody sold two different drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.639" offset="1702398">I submit that that easily could have been a scheme to sell drugs, and this is consequently of no real assistance in trying to find out what "pattern" means.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.676" offset="1954532">The first is that Congress spoke of a pattern of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.565" offset="1970100">It is that pattern of the two acts, pattern of activity, of racketeering activity, racketeering activity being the commission or two or more acts, or at least two acts, it is that pattern that we must look at to find continuity within it, not extraneous from it but within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.184" offset="2040631">Is the act, does it have continuity while the pattern is being committed?</text>
            <text syncTime="484.165" offset="2068530">All patterns, or many patterns end when they are discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.132" offset="2084412">For example, a criminal enterprise, if you arrest everyone, you end the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.035" offset="2104056">Are they going to escape RICO now because they are all in jail?</text>
            <text syncTime="496.440" offset="2117640">I don't think that was the purpose of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.048" offset="2128089">It was to look at the pattern during the period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.376" offset="2137389">Just as the word "pattern" has that element, we must limit it to the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.264" offset="2156928">And those two elements, relatedness and continuity, can be further defined, I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.290" offset="4989020">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.271" offset="5016918">I think in order for this argument to make any sense, it has to be put into a context, and I think the context is this Court's decision in Sedima v. Imrex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.346" offset="5053281">I know there are three opinions written in that case, and the three opinions come to quite different conclusions about the issues of the case, but there is a single theme running through all three opinions, and that is concern about the disquieting problem that civil RICO is running far beyond the intent of the Congress to attack organized crime and to prevent its infiltration into legitimate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.273" offset="5156935">Justice Powell in his opinion observed that if Congress had intended to provide a federal forum for plaintiffs for so many common law wrongs, it would at least have discussed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.471" offset="5201761">Justice Marshall's dissenting opinion for himself and Justices Brennan, Blackmun and Powell, observed that in criminal application, prosecutorial discretion has had a desirable restraining influence in bringing RICO actions, but in the civil application, that desirable restraining influence is absent, and indeed, the reverse is true, the lure of treble damages and reasonable attorneys' fees is bringing about a situation in which we are on the verge of federalizing what has heretofore been state criminal and state common law problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.019" offset="5351913">Justice White's opinion for the Court expressly raised the need for imposing reasonable limits on the scope of RICO by reference to the definition of pattern of racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.515" offset="5405934">In what has now become certainly one of the most celebrated footnotes in recent judicial history, Footnote 14, Justice White pointed out that a pattern--</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. French</label>
            <text syncTime="1331.711" offset="5458701">--Justice White for the Court pointed out that a pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity but does not mean two acts, and also that there are two factors, continuity and relationship, that have to combine to produce a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.970" offset="5531740">In a somewhat less celebrated footnote, Footnote 10, that I think is important here, the Court also observed that while the remedial provisions of Section 1964 of the statute may be liberally construed, at the same time the substantive provisions of 1961 and &lt;nineteen sixty-two&gt; [= 1962] may legitimately be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.930" offset="5623586">The opinion for the Court observed that we have come to a point in which private civil RICO actions are being brought almost solely against legitimate businesses rather than organized crime operations, and it concluded this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.346" offset="5685235">We nonetheless recognize that in its private, civil version, RICO is evolving into something quite different from the original conception of its enactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.387" offset="5733405">The extraordinary wishes... pardon me... the extraordinary uses to which civil RICO has been put appear to be primarily the result of the breadth of the predicate offenses, in particular, the inclusion of wire, mail and securities fraud, and the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.721" offset="5834760">The remainder, the remainder of the Court's remarks relate to something that I think can be dealt with here, and that is the failure of the courts to develop a meaningful concept of pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.605" offset="5898290">Now, that is what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.308" offset="5905082">Following Sedima, the courts have tried, most of the courts have tried to react to the opinions, all three opinions written in Sedima, and what they have done is take the invitation in the opinion of the Court to try to develop a meaningful concept of pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.159" offset="5980523">As Footnote 14 remarks, in common parlance, two of anything do not generally form a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.532" offset="6013960">Reaction to Footnote 14 in Sedima and the text of Sedima is plainly what led the Eighth Circuit to the test that it is now using.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.996" offset="6059831">The Eighth Circuit has said that on three or four occasions, including in this particular case, and the test that the Eighth Circuit has adopted is that in order to deal with both relationship and continuity, which have to mean two separate things or you wouldn't use two separate words, there has to be evidence or allegations that the defendant has engaged in like activities in the past or other criminal activities elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.094" offset="6164216">I think this is a reasonable attempt to fathom what RICO, particularly in the light of Sedima.</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.141" offset="6308412">Contrary to the argument put forward by the Petitioners, the Eighth Circuit is not alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.076" offset="6336207">The Tenth Circuit and the Fourth Circuits each expressly use the word "schemes".</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.153" offset="6356478">Also, even though the Second and Seventh Circuits do not use the word "schemes", in their recent decisions they are using reasoning and reaching results comparable to the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.710" offset="6410708">So the Eighth Circuit is not off on a frolic of its own, and it is not true that this case would have been decided differently in any other circuit in America.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.153" offset="6500465">The Seventh Circuit talks about continuity plus relationship and talks about the predicate acts... I'm reading from page 26 of Respondents' brief, Your Honor, and I'm reading from Medical Emergency Service Associates v. Foulke, which we quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.299" offset="6597013">"in order for the predicate acts to be sufficiently continuous to amount to a pattern of racketeering activity, the predicate acts must be ongoing over an identified period of time so that they can fairly be viewed as constituting separate transactions, i.e., transactions somewhat separated by time and place. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.181" offset="6684576">And I believe "transaction", as used by that court, is the same as "scheme" in the Eighth Circuit or "episode" as used by some other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.913" offset="6711534">I agree with Mr. Reinhardt that we oughtn't to get bogged down in the semantics of the particular word, but separate in time and separate in space seems to be what most of the circuits are trying to comprehend here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2190.177" offset="8892549">It was faced with two other questions: do we have to find prior convictions, and do we have to find something special called racketeering injury?</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.311" offset="8965065">Now, perhaps if Sedima came back, the Court would find no pattern of racketeering activity there, but I'm not able to opine on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.151" offset="8996517">With respect to the present case, there are, I think, two possibilities, and that is that the Court can agree that some variation of scheme or episode or transaction is a correct test, and that as a result, the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.173" offset="9084602">It is also possible that the Court could conclude that one of the other circuits that has suggested a multiple factors test... and I know I don't have to labor the Court with multiple factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.011" offset="9135906">It appears in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.558" offset="9142071">We've collected a number of them at page 23 of our memorandum, and to my delight, the Petitioner has cited an excellent multiple factors case that I would be happy to live with in its memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.755" offset="9206855">It's the Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan case in the Petitioners' memorandum at page 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.516" offset="9245934">I believe the Court could say that under a multiple factors test, it can also affirm, and the reason I feel so strongly about that is that that's exactly what Judge MacLaughlin did in this case in the district court in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.761" offset="9298910">When the case was first argued to Judge MacLaughlin, I argued for dismissal under the Eighth Circuit test, and Judge MacLaughlin so ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.898" offset="9339452">Petitioners then asked Judge MacLaughlin on rehearing to reconsider what test he would apply, and having knowledge that he was bound by the Eighth Circuit test, he went on to say, nonetheless, I recognize a multiple factors test is being applied in other circuits, and I will apply it here and see what I conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.780" offset="9418969">And as Judge MacLaughlin's second opinion in the Joint Appendix notes, he looked at the duration of criminal activity, the threat of ongoing criminal activity, the presence of single or multiple victims, the independent harmful significance of the alleged predicate acts, and whether the alleged conduct is a regular part of Defendant's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.975" offset="9507785">And having done all of that, he nonetheless found that the complaint failed to state a claim under RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.582" offset="9534221">Relating this case, if the Court please, back to the concerns expressed in Sedima, I was impressed yesterday again in my reading to read the testimony of Senator McClellan before the House when S. 30 went over for consideration there, and he talked about organized crime quietly sneaking into a business, infiltrating it, using it for corrupt purposes, bilking it of its funds, letting it fall into bankruptcy and dissolving away into the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.192" offset="9676641">I believe that is the kind of criminal activity that both the House and Senate were seeking to prevent--</text>

            <text syncTime="2470.142" offset="10012471">It simply must be that the Congress wanted to encompass something more than that via RICO, and that's what makes sense because, as I said earlier, in this particular case, for example, the Ramsey County attorney has convened a grand jury which didn't indict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.448" offset="10077673">The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has reopened the rate proceeding and reconsidered the rate to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.571" offset="10102123">The Attorney General of Minnesota has an action going against the company right now relating to past rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.897" offset="10127410">It is simply not true that civil RICO is needed in the instance of a 75 year old public utility that has an office building in downtown Minneapolis that occupies a city block and that has engaged in a sequence of activities that are readily open to public scrutiny by reason of the fact that the entity is so thoroughly regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.918" offset="10219570">I do not believe RICO applies in my hypothetical, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.088" offset="10240259">The Court has before it here a situation in which there is no threat of organized crime infiltrating legitimate business, and there is no threat of racketeering activity being conducted in a manner that cannot be reached by officials of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.657" offset="10334509">I think it is important either under the Eighth Circuit test or a multiple factors test that applies in these circumstances for the Court to affirm the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.510" offset="10389888">If a complaint as insubstantial as the complaint pleaded here today is allowed to stand, then everything in America in which a victim claims injury by reason of a fraud or one of the other predicate acts set forth in the statute, becomes civil RICO, and state common law has been federalized with a treble damages remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.280" offset="10500961">I do not believe that is what Congress intended, and I do not believe that that is what this Court should allow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.917" offset="10547563">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.963" offset="10555714">Your Honor, in response to Mr. French's argument that the floodgates of litigation are opened on RICO, I'd like to point out to the Court that there are but 85 RICO cases per month out of 23,000 federal cases being pled today, and that has been double for approximately two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.000" offset="10651844">I would also like to point out that the Court's decision in Shearson American Express where they subjected RICO to arbitration surely will have a further limitation upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.620" offset="10698342">This floodgates argument is an argument that you frequently hear bantered about, but I submit that it simply hasn't come to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.040" offset="10724047">Secondly, I submit that we will not have every fraud case in America being brought before the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.190" offset="10764589">This case involved bribery over a period of five years, in 1983, offering employment to a commissioner while still sitting, before a major vote; in 1985, making employment arrangements with a commissioner, passing $30,000 after the commissioner left the court, to an attorney who then deposited it into his account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.791" offset="10866989">It was listed as attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.618" offset="10878378">That attorney then wrote separate checks to the commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.726" offset="10890812">The commissioner then got back on the commission and, interestingly enough, neglected to mention when required to do so by Minnesota ethical requirements as part of his income, neglected to mention this $30,000 he had just received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.908" offset="10947446">I submit this is not a mere business oversight; this is, as alleged in the complaint, out and out bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.825" offset="10975136">There are... we state in our complaint that it affected Bell charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.230" offset="11004811">We don't say it affected one charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.963" offset="11011707">It went on for a period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.791" offset="11019021">In fact, there are probably 40 or 50 rate hearings a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.365" offset="11045353">The particular activity centered around particular rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.724" offset="11062803">However, Your Honor, we must remember that we have not even been allowed to conduct discovery yet in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.736" offset="11086835">The facts that we have are the mere bones of the complaint, and I allege that what we have submitted to you shows a clear, ongoing course of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.124" offset="11124347">As this Court recognized, RICO applies to illegitimate as well as legitimate businesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.166" offset="11476478">Surely there is in the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.427" offset="11525588">--Your Honor, many courts have said that where you have a legitimate enterprise you never have a problem of continuity because obviously the continuity is ongoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.344" offset="11565189">I think that really addresses an illegitimate enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.515" offset="11585878">However, again, even there, I think you have to look during the existence of the acts, the Barticheck case, which we cite in our brief, points this out very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.010" offset="11623913">If you catch the people, they are not doing it anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.885" offset="11631436">It's senseless to look at it afterwards or elsewhere or before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.648" offset="11646483">If we had pled, we had pled perhaps five or six acts of racketeering, if we had pled two, do we satisfy Mr. French's definition then that before or after the pattern we plead there were acts?</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.565" offset="11694130">It becomes a very semantical game.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.425" offset="11701549">You have to look for the continuity within the actual pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.799" offset="11711057">Again, as Justice Stevens stated, if racketeer... if the Mafia had done this we would not be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.872" offset="11747315">There's little question that no court would say that this activity should be forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.417" offset="11773542">Yet that is exactly what Congress dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.744" offset="11782842">It dealt with activity, not with a status offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.025" offset="11791932">RICO is not a person-oriented status offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.726" offset="11806770">It is an offense that Congress, as Senator McClellan said, the occasion for our writing this law is being confused with the results of our investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.597" offset="11858283">They found activity repugnant, and that activity was activity which they believed was committed by organized crime, and indeed, was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.360" offset="11889317">But it is the activity that's repugnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.719" offset="11894750">If anybody commits that repugnant activity, they should be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.246" offset="11912827">It is not a status offense to be committed only by some, only by a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.119" offset="11932367">This is an offense which lays out forbidden activity, and that activity, if committed by anyone, deserves the punishment that RICO calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.460" offset="11973745">And our complaint should be reinstated for those reasons.</text>
