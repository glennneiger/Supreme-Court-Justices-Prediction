            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="137363">We'll hear argument now in No. 87-1207, Ray Will v. Michigan Department of State Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.293" offset="174457">Mr. Burnham, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="12.027" stopTime="92.948">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="12.027" offset="185428">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.979" offset="197236">In 1973 Petitioner applied for a... for a job with the Michigan State Police as a computer analyst.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.366" offset="226806">He was fully qualified for this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.740" offset="232240">He did not get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.225" offset="238196">And he subsequently found out that the reason he did not get that was because the Michigan State Police had a so-called "Red Squad" which maintained dossiers on persons who had engaged in certain political activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.064" offset="285530">The plaintiff, believing that he was wronged, sued in the Michigan Court of Claims under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, and he recovered a judgment to redress this violation of his Federal Constitution rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.559" offset="331505">The Michigan Supreme Court took away that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.323" offset="342581">They did not take away that judgment on the ground that there was no case on the merits, it's admitted now that in fact the Respondents did violate his due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.664" offset="383959">It was not taken away because of any lack of jurisdiction in the Michigan courts for handling such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.661" offset="407992">Michigan courts are fully competent to handle Section 1983 claims, and the Michigan Court of Claims is the court which is specially constituted to hear claims against the State of Michigan and its departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.892" offset="448847">The Michigan Supreme Court reversed the case because, in its view, the Petitioner had not made out a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, because the Respondents were not persons acting under color of state law within the meaning of that statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="92.948" stopTime="117.361">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="92.948" offset="509138">Mr. Burnham, one thing that seems strange to me about this case is, if the Supreme Court of Michigan had wanted to award damages on this cause of action, it surely could have done so just under some general state law theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.474" offset="567234">Was the intimation from the Supreme Court of Michigan opinion that, had the Petitioner chosen to sue just under state law rather than under 1983 the result might have been different?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="117.361" stopTime="150.425">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="117.361" offset="606731">Well, it would depend on whether or not the Chief Justice has in mind state constitutional law or state law of another type, in other words state tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.435" offset="639019">Under state tort law this claim would be barred by, by the state's sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.763" offset="656364">If it's state constitutional law, after this very case was decided, then the Supreme Court, the Michigan Supreme Court in this case, established that one could in fact sue under the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.710" offset="696174">Prior to that time, it had not so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.631" offset="703802">And consequently, had he had, had the benefit of this very case at the time that he filed his case perhaps he would have framed things differently.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="150.425" stopTime="154.970">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="150.425" offset="739015">The holding as to the state constitution was in this very case but it was not applied to him.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="154.970" stopTime="255.417">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="154.970" offset="757196">But it was not applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.111" offset="761794">There were two cases, the Smith case and the Will Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.141" offset="773915">And in the Will case they determined that he had not clearly made out... had not clearly preserved for appeal the issue of the violation of the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.434" offset="811009">And in the Smith case, however, they had preserved it and consequently they had to decide that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.105" offset="829712">But this is the first case in which the Supreme Court of Michigan has indicated that a state constitutional claim would not be barred by state sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.304" offset="866493">Prior to that and if it's on any other theory, any tort theory, anything like that, it would clearly be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.427" offset="891048">It's Petitioner's position in this case that the Respondents, Michigan Department of State Police and the Director of the Michigan State Police, are in fact persons within, within the meaning of the statute for basically three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.406" offset="938904">First of all, the statutory language says so, and secondly, the legislative history tells us that as well, and finally there was no reason to depart from the clear meaning of the statute and the legislative history in order to read those terms differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.399" offset="998881">In terms of the language of the statute, the well-established rule of statutory construction as far as this very issue is concerned, is that if there is a federal statute which addresses activities that states are equally capable of engaging in, that are targeted by that statute, then the rule is that "person" include states unless Congress expressly excludes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.157" offset="1089892">And in the antitrust laws, under the Clayton Act, and under the Sherman Act, the Robinson-Patman Act, this Court has indicated that person in those statutes include states.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.841" offset="1128658">And the most recent case, of course, is the Jefferson County Pharmaceutical case at 460 U.S. In 1983 dealing with the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="255.417" offset="1158960">Mr. Burnham, don't you think the amendment, the retroactively-effective amendment, of the Dictionary Act bears on the meaning of persons in this statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="267.225" stopTime="290.170">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="267.225" offset="1206189">I don't believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.787" offset="1212459">And the reason for that is that, first of all, it doesn't bear on it because I don't believe that the wording change that is made in that, in fact, does what Respondents would say that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.328" offset="1262614">In other words, the 1874, the new version of the Dictionary Act, basically gives us the same definition that is in the antitrust acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.420" offset="1291035">In other words, corporations, associations--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="290.170" stopTime="298.432">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="290.170" offset="1298036">Well, there's pretty clear evidence of an intent not to have the language so broad for the very purpose of making sure it didn't include states.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="298.432" stopTime="348.677">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="298.432" offset="1331054">--Well, that intent is the intent of the commissioners of the revision commission, and it's quite well established that the revision commission's comments are not the legislative history of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.850" offset="1368671">As a matter of fact, the revision commission was fired by Congress because it made too many changes, and in fact it's been noted by every commentator that in fact that is not part of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.797" offset="1408481">That may, may have been the intent of the revisors, but Congress in passing the 1874 code clearly did not rely on that, they relied on Mr. Durant's revisions of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.012" offset="1457383">And Mr. Durant, in fact, went through and tried to make as many changes back to the original language as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.604" offset="1479743">The only explanation is that Congress simply, at the last minute, felt it needed a code, it passed and had the task, task before it to pass, all of the statutes that theretofore had been passed as part of the code, and simply passed it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="348.677" stopTime="368.952">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="348.677" offset="1531988">Well, don't you also think that the history of the 1871 act, as outlined in Monell, indicates that the framers of that act thought they had no constitutional power to impose an independent federal duty on state officers or instrumentalities--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="368.952" stopTime="370.574">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="368.952" offset="1613072">I don't believe that that is--</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="370.574" stopTime="376.228">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="370.574" offset="1619655">--And it would be rather surprising in light of that history that they intended to include the states?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="376.228" stopTime="411.417">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="376.228" offset="1642225">--I think that what Congress was speaking of is the type of liability that was, that was dealt with in the subject at hand, which of course was the Sherman Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.881" offset="1676811">And the Sherman Amendment did, did not deal with the question of whether or not, and this Court of course found in Monell, did not deal with the question of whether or not states or for that matter municipalities that took action that violated constitutional rights could not be subjected to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.016" offset="1733340">That was not the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.985" offset="1737206">The question was whether or not a duty to maintain a police force could be imposed upon counties as subdivisions of states by way of this vicarious liability in the Sherman Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="411.417" stopTime="426.818">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="411.417" offset="1782973">But it's most unlikely in light of the history of that act and, and the purpose of the Ku Klux Klan Act that the 42nd Congress Intended to create a damage action against state governments to be heard in state court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_burnham" startTime="426.818" stopTime="520.172">
            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="426.818" offset="1844622">Well, the question of state court, I think, has to be separated from the question of whether or not a cause of action is, is set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.675" offset="1871998">In other words, Congress clearly in Section 1 was authorizing a remedy to be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.032" offset="1893419">Now, Congress did indicate that remedy... it was also at the same time creating jurisdiction without regard to amount of controversy in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.576" offset="1919645">However, at that time and today and since Mr. Hamilton wrote Federalist No. 82, it's been quite clear that the standard is that there was concurrent jurisdiction in state courts unless Congress makes that exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.604" offset="1971681">And as a matter of fact, that section of, of, of Federalist No. 82 was actually read on the floor of the Congress at the time in the debates at the time that Section 1983 was being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.129" offset="2017866">Congress was fully advised of that, this Court has noted that there's jurisdiction, concurrent jurisdiction, in state courts, in addition to which we must keep in mind the fact that from the time of the Constitution until 1875 federal questions, including Federal Constitutional questions, could only be brought in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.356" offset="2094770">It's highly unlikely that Congress would have forgotten that at the time that it was authorizing the cause of action to enforce the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.369" offset="2126744">I might also add that the slaughterhouse cases were filed in 1870, and the slaughterhouse cases were, of course, filed in the, the Louisiana State Court as a means of enforcing the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.863" offset="2168749">And consequently anyone who is familiar with the slaughterhouse cases, and of course they were quite notable at the time, in the news media and otherwise, would have known that that was an example of enforcing the 14th Amendment in state court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="520.172" offset="2217964">Were they brought under Section 1983 in the Louisiana courts?</text>

            <text syncTime="524.654" offset="2235936">The filing of that predated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.637" offset="2247848">The first reported case, I believe, under Section 1983, I believe, was in &lt;eighteen seventy-three&gt; [= 1873] in the Circuit Court in Illinois, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.539" offset="2287450">And that, interest... interestingly enough, was a suit by a company against the City of Hyde Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.552" offset="2307512">In other words, a suit against a, a governmental subdivision, an entity in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.753" offset="2332276">And that case, of course, was relied on in this Court, by this Court, in the Monell case, in 436 U.S. And consequently the statute was not used at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.514" offset="2387342">I mean, our whole theory in Monell was that cities are not, are not states, that they haven't been treated like states.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.948" offset="2421092">I mean, to cite Monell as, as authority for what you want us to do here is to really pull it inside-out, it seems to me.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="583.848" offset="2472710">Well, more than that, I think it, I think it, it... it's rationale refutes the statement you just made, that any, any earlier case that had to do with the city is somehow authority for suits against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.016" offset="2521402">Monell says quite the contrary, that the reason suits against cities are allowed is that they weren't considered governments.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="601.327" offset="2542614">--No, I, I don't believe that that... the rationale of Monell, as I understand Monell, is that there's no reason to exclude cities because of the fact that the Sherman Amendment was defeated or for any other reason, that cities, the entity itself is as capable as the officers of that city of engaging in the kinds of activities that were the focus of the, of Section 1 of the 1871 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.004" offset="2641356">And consequently there was no reason in the Sherman Amendment, which of course Monroe v. Pape held, excluded cities, there was no reason to read its defeat as meaning that cities were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.375" offset="2690780">But simply the fact that cities were as capable of engaging in those kinds of depredations that the Court believed that there was no reason to exclude them.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.186" offset="2726098">And of course, the Dictionary Act was relied on... upon in Monell, and the Dictionary Act did not refer to cities or counties, it said bodies, corporate and politic.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.463" offset="3523146">And that of course is a separate issue from the cause of action question, because Congress must, must not just authorize suit against the state, Congress must make its intent clear, must have considered the 11th Amendment and firmly decided to abrogate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.100" offset="3581660">In the vernacular I suppose you could say Congress is saying not only that the states can be sued but also, read my lips, we mean it, the states can be sued.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Burnham</label>
            <text syncTime="1310.151" offset="5377944">Well, there are a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.338" offset="5382646">The first reason is that the 1866 act led to the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.711" offset="5404171">In other words, the reason why the 14th Amendment was written and passed by Congress, in large part, was because they believed that there were constitutional problems with the 1866 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.425" offset="5447012">And consequently, a more generalized version of the 1866 criminal law is what gave us the current Section 1 of the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.109" offset="5485778">In that broader context, in other words outside of the narrow criminal context, Congress chose the words, "no state shall", and consequently Congress is telling us by doing that that this kind of liability that they're talking about is at the very least official capacity liability, and certainly in a broader context where we're talking about the non-criminal situation, that that is a situation where it is the state itself that is prohibited from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.239" offset="5594238">Now, then, after... that was in 1866, then 1868 the 14th Amendment, then in 1871 they want to enforce the 14th Amendment, they go back and simply use the old language from the 1866 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.500" offset="5643348">But they indicate in the preamble that they are enforcing the provisions of the 14th Amendment, which of course says itself, "no state shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.386" offset="5674904">The second reason is that the kind of liability that they spoke of in the 1866 act, and the use to which it was put historically, was to render criminally liable judges, other officials, for official capacity actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.881" offset="5732792">In other words, the actions that were brought were in fact actions that were brought for a judge, for example, excluding blacks from a jury, pursuant to a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.033" offset="5773438">That judge was arrested and tried before the Federal court for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.922" offset="5789007">That is precisely the kind of official capacity type action which we are talking about here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.691" offset="5908125">In other words, we are handicapped to a certain extent by the fact that Congress was more excited about, and debated more, the other sections, which perhaps were more problematic and did not have such debate on Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.748" offset="5964341">But everyone who referred to Section 1, and, and the quotations are in the brief, refers to the fact that it was meant to reach violations by the state itself in its corporate and legislative capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.331" offset="6226610">In other words, the concern was that state governments were in fact allowing all sorts of violations by individuals and were not enforcing the law, as well as the fact that they themselves might have affirmative laws which in fact denied rights to, to the former freed persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.222" offset="6374150">He did not say that it reenacts the Constitution except for the part that says, "no state shall".</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.746" offset="6448338">Representative Sheilabarger, who was a sponsor of the bill, indicated that the states remained unrestrained, and therefore there's a need for this remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.565" offset="6543528">The State takes the position, first, Congress has the power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to include the states within Section 1, that is to include the states within the meaning of person, but it did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.622" offset="6603819">And our second position is since this action for damages was in the Michigan Court of Claims, against the office of the director of the State Police, not the director of the State Police personally, and the only defendant in the Michigan Court of Claims is the State of Michigan itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.943" offset="6681036">There is only one defendant in this case, and that's the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.721" offset="6700158">And the caption merely sets forth in two different ways a cause of action against the State of Michigan.</text>

            <label>Mr. George H. Weller</label>
            <text syncTime="1652.373" offset="6746761">Yes, they did, You Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.185" offset="6754075">They found... when they described the state not being a person they then proceeded to describe an action against the state official who was being sued in this case and used the same logic and the same premise and found that he was not a person as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.897" offset="6812903">Now, on our first position, if Congress intended to use its new power under the 14th Amendment that had been enacted three years before, and to do away with the traditional immunity of the states from an action for damages, in their own state courts, and do this on a federal cause of action, Congress would have expressly said so in Section 1, or would have made a clear statement that the states were included within the meaning of the word "person".</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.885" offset="6944873">And the reasons for this are, number one, as this Court has pointed out, in common usage, "person" does not include a sovereign state and statutes using the word "person" are ordinarily interpreted not to include a sovereign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.895" offset="7008925">And secondly, there was no presumption in 1871 that the word "person" included the sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.765" offset="7044347">In other words, the Dictionary Act of the previous Congress, not the same Congress, as set forth by the Petitioner, but the Dictionary Act of the previous Congress did not intend to include the sates within the meaning of the word "person".</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.121" offset="7097846">This is illustrated by the commissioners' action in changing the wording and further illustrated by Mr. Durant's further analysis of what the commissioners had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.022" offset="7149360">And he made a report on December the 10th in 1873 to the Congress, and he said, I have retained only those meanings that are found in the statutes at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.063" offset="7197530">And the meanings that he retained that the commissioners utilized was to use partnerships and corporations as the meaning of person in the Dictionary Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.791" offset="7264507">In the Sherman Act and other acts, as I understand it, Your Honor, the word "person" of course may include the states under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.427" offset="7307035">You have to analyze and determine whether or not the word "person" includes the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.925" offset="7325007">There are some cases, for example, in which the states were setting up pharmaceutical practices that were competing with private enterprise in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.392" offset="7354891">But our basic premise here is that the word "person" ordinarily is not used to include the states, and there's no indication that the states were intended to be included within the meaning of the word in this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.854" offset="7412779">So with no common usage, and with no presumption, and with no expressed statement, the plain meaning of person in the 1871 act, our position is, did not include the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.472" offset="7479234">Now, if Congress had intended to include the states within the meaning of the word, this would have been a radical change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.061" offset="7513507">And under the law at the time, a radical change would require an explicit showing or would require an expressed statement or a clear statement that it was the collective will of the Congress to include the states within this meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.665" offset="7579962">And to include the states within the meaning of the word "person", in light of Quern, would mean that Congress by its collective will intended to subject the states to actions for damages in their own state courts on a federal cause of action.</text>

            <label>Mr. George H. Weller</label>
            <text syncTime="1939.164" offset="7893954">Well, we're speaking of the intention of Congress in 1871, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.178" offset="7914016">And in 1871... again, our position is that states were not included, that the intention of the previous Congress was to include corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.127" offset="7953827">But as they used corporations it did not include the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.954" offset="7969082">Now, the Court in... the Court in Quern has already held that Section 1983 was not intended to abrogate the state's traditional sovereign immunity in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.182" offset="8022059">The Court in Quern also pointed out that no member of Congress in the legislative history of legislative debate made any mention of financial consequences to the states, nor did any member focus directly on the question of state liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.659" offset="8103979">So that... since Quern has already has already held there's no federal right in the federal courts, there's the strongest implication in Quern that the... this Court did not intend to interpret person as including the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.916" offset="8177017">Now, the purpose of the 1871 act was, of course, to enforce the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.555" offset="8203557">And under the 14th Amendment, under Section &lt;five&gt; [= 5], it was left to Congress to decide whether to enact legislation or what kind of legislation to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.878" offset="8252772">Congress could choose to act to the fullness of its power, or Congress could choose to act to some lesser degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.360" offset="8282761">It didn't need to exercise all of its power under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.045" offset="8305539">And our position is that Congress did not need, in 1871, to exercise all of its power and include the states within the meaning of the word "person" in part because, as the Court has already pointed out, the problem was not with the state laws on the books or with the state remedies that were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.503" offset="8399371">The problem was with enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.470" offset="8411179">State laws were not being equally enforced, or the state laws were not being enforced at all, or the state courts were powerless to act or they were in league with those who were depriving others of their federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.934" offset="8469066">So the perceived need in Congress in 1871 was for effective enforcement and open, fair, and objective courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.758" offset="8508354">So the perceived need, the collective will of the Congress, was to give immediate access to the federal courts for actions for damages or for suits for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.207" offset="8558091">And this need was fulfilled by using the word "person" that included government officials, and included local communities, as this Court pointed out in Monell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.811" offset="8608560">But there is no perceived need nor was there any collective will to include the states within the 1871 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.448" offset="8651087">For one thing, there is no tradition in 1871 of an action or a suit against a state, against its will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.880" offset="8688808">In fact, I've been unable to find any such case between Chisholm v. Georgia in 1793 and 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.611" offset="8723707">What there was in 1871 was a strong tradition of the immunity of the states from suits in their own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.342" offset="8762682">That doesn't mean the 1871 act did not provide relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.840" offset="8784625">For example, actions for damages were made available in the federal courts against those against whom such actions had long been recognized, for example, state officials and local officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.505" offset="8843348">And as the Court said in Monell, local communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.706" offset="8860171">And in response to your question, sir, the Prosser of his day was a gentleman called Hillard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.298" offset="8882532">And in Hillard on Torts, at page 269 in 1866, Mr. Hillard points out the ready availability of actions for damages against public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.903" offset="8936971">Mr. Hillard also wrote another book on injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.947" offset="8953063">In 1864 on page 443 and 444 he points out that there was a long tradition of suits for injunctive relief against public officers who are acting illegally or unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.175" offset="9013980">And in there he cites other cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.846" offset="9024743">So the 1871 act provided relief against state officials--</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.693" offset="9320135">Some of them are cited in our brief, and Hillard I found after we wrote our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.659" offset="9335913">So this recourse in the 1871 act against officials and local communities, but not against the states, it ensured the supremacy of federal law but at the same time it accommodated the traditional immunity of the states in what this Court in Monell referred to as coordinate sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.428" offset="9455032">In other words, it made the balance that ensured that federal law would be supreme, the federal Constitution would be supreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.409" offset="9486901">Now, the immediate reason for the 1871 act was the violence that was being directed towards blacks and towards sympathetic whites who were the backbone of the southern Republican Parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.059" offset="9545520">But the act, of course, applied to all of the states, not just the southern states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.759" offset="9576344">And so we have this question, the Court has yet to hold... this Court has yet to hold that a state court must entertain a claim under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.130" offset="9625872">What this Court has said is that a state court may not discriminate against a type of federal action when that same type of action arising under state law is enforced in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.185" offset="9686059">So it's most unlikely that in 1871 it was the collective will of the 1871 Congress, and particularly since the senators were still being elected by the legislatures not by the people, it's most unlikely that it was the collective will of that Congress to include the states within the meaning of the word 1871 Congress to abrogate their traditional sovereign immunity of their states, only in the state courts, and thus raise the possibility that the states would be subject to actions for damages on a federal cause of action in their state courts when they would not be subject to the same type of cause of action under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.645" offset="9923877">So our feeling is... our basic premise is there is nothing in the context, or in the subject matter, or in the legislative history or in the tenor of the times to show that it was the collective will of the Congress, a Republican-dominated House and Senate, to do away with the traditional immunity of the states and subject them to damages in their own state courts.</text>

Corens, for example, v.

            <text syncTime="2731.954" offset="11065115">However, I did not mention the liquor tax laws in which the definition is partnership, association, company, or corporation, as well as natural persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.918" offset="11105030">This Court has held that the state is a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.386" offset="11110881">The shipping act, corporations, partnerships, and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of any state, that includes the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.883" offset="11140870">The antitrust definition is precisely corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.552" offset="11167515">The Court has held in all those circumstances that the state is in fact a person.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.110" offset="11217774">As a matter of fact, one of the arguments that was made was that person should mean something different if it's a plaintiff than if it's a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.857" offset="11244733">And it was precisely that argument that was rejected by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.325" offset="11258630">In fact, if you're a person you're either in or out of that definition, and it doesn't vary depending on the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.400" offset="11278901">And of course, that rule is followed in a slightly different way in the civil rights context, that this Court held in Kenosha v. Bruno, that you can't bifurcate person somehow according to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.505" offset="11319339">Either they are persons or they're not, and if they are there as Congress says, action at law, suits in equity... everything applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.331" offset="11502614">Maine v. Thiboutot was a 1983 action brought in state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2867.727" offset="11608253">--In, in, in the interest of stare decisis, I would suggest, however, that that perhaps is, is, is water over the dam and has been for, for almost, almost 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.379" offset="11646810">Mr. Weller also indicated, I believe, that, that there were no suits against states prior to 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.905" offset="11692890">And in fact in, in Petitioner's reply brief we indicate Wilson v. New Jersey was a suit in state court against the State of New Jersey in 1812, Woodruff v. Trapnell was a suit against a bank receiver in their official capacity in 1850, of course Curran v. Arkansas in 1857.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.883" offset="11756837">And Curran v. Arkansas is an interesting case for another purpose, and that gets to the next matter I would like to address, and that is the question of the jurisdiction of state courts to handle Section 1983 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.909" offset="11804903">In fact, there is no question about concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.580" offset="11819636">In other words, the Court does not have to reach that because the Michigan Supreme Court quite clearly indicated that Michigan courts have jurisdiction over those cases, and moreover that Michigan's sovereign immunity is no bar to any of those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.887" offset="11868850">And consequently the sole reason why the Michigan Supreme Court decided the case, as it did, was because it believed that the state was not a person, i.e. there was not a cause of action against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.477" offset="11907198">I might not have been exactly clear in responding to Justice Scalia's question about the nature of the 11th Amendment bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.365" offset="11934783">I would like to indicate that in the antitrust area, for example, the distinction is also made between the cause of action and the defense of the 11th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.720" offset="11972191">And as a matter of fact even though, under the antitrust laws, the state is a person who may be sued under the antitrust laws, the 11th Amendment bars damages relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.529" offset="12007404">And consequently it did not affect the Court's decision that states were persons.</text>
