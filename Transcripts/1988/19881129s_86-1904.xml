            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86546">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in number 86-1904, Arizona against Youngblood.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.154" offset="115072">In this case, a 10-year-old boy was molested and sodomized by a middle-aged man for one-and-a-half hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.998" offset="142448">After the assault, the boy was taken to a hospital where a physician used a sexual assault kit to collect evidence from the boy's body.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.536" offset="176616">The police also collected the boy's clothing which they failed to refrigerate.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.194" offset="195320">A police criminologist later performed some tests on this evidence but he was unable to obtain information about the identity of the boy's assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.081" offset="230846">At trial, expert witnesses testified that respondent might have been completely exhaunerated by timely performance of test with properly preserved evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.575" offset="268776">Respondent was convicted of child-molestation, sexual assault, and kidnapping in an Arizona State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.362" offset="295944">The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that the state had breach a constitutional duty to preserve the evidence from the victim's body and clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.943" offset="334291">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.861" offset="361981">Failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.005" offset="386536">Here, the police's failure to refrigerate the victim's clothing and to perform certain tests on the evidence can at worst be described as negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.733" offset="417465">None of this information was concealed from respondent at trial and the evidence, such as it was, was made available to respondent's expert who declined to perform any tests on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.111" offset="458948">The Arizona Court of Appeals noted in its opinion that there was no suggestion of bad faith on the part of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.445" offset="484234">It follows, therefore, that there was no violation of the due process clause and the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.410" offset="512133">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.967" offset="526344">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan and Marshall have joined.</text>
