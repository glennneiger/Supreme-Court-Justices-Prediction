            <label>Mr. Richard James Braun</label>
            <text syncTime="57.753" offset="368504">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.906" offset="389193">This case involves the pretrial appealability of decisions by district courts with respect to indictments in which a 6(e) error is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.452" offset="459306">We agree with the government that this case is governed by an application of Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.504" offset="479577">The government has agreed with us that at least the first of the three Cohen prongs has been satisfied in that the district court decision conclusively determines the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.728" offset="524403">The second prong of Cohen... the government disagrees that that prong is met as to whether or not the case involves an important issue separate from the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.435" offset="567244">The government says it does not because a 6(e) violation will, under this Court's decision in Mechanik, be merged into the merits and become harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.125" offset="606010">However, the government's argument assumes that the 6(e) violation did not undermine grand jury independence and therefore affect the grand jury's charging decision so as to deprive a defendant of his requirement of indictment by an independent grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.837" offset="672883">That right is supported by two of this... at least two of this Court's previous cases: Stirone, which said that the purpose of the Fifth Amendment requirement of indictment by grand jury is to limit a citizen's jeopardy to offenses charged by fellow citizens acting independently, judge or prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.535" offset="763685">This case's... and this Court's subsequent decision in Dionisio that the Fifth Amendment guarantee presupposes an investigative body acting independently of prosecutor and judge and added that the Constitution cannot tolerate the transformation of the grand jury into an instrument of oppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.199" offset="854278">That right is further supported by this Court's recent holding in Nova Scotia that if there is grave doubt that the decision to indict was free from the substantial influences of prosecutorial misconduct, the error cannot be deemed harmless and that the inquiry is into the impact of the violation on the grand jury's decision to indict.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.551" offset="967753">The constitutional right to an indictment by an independent grand jury is also supported by the Second Circuit's 1983 decision in Hogan, the Ninth Circuit's 1983 decision in Sears.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.078" offset="1029820">6(e) violations, unlike many other procedural errors, can impact adversely on a grand jury's independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.785" offset="1072661">This Court has recognized that fact in again at least two of its previous opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.606" offset="1095962">In the Pittsburg Plate Glass case, this Court says that... said that without secrecy, the grand jury would not be able to act with the independence required of an inquisitorial and accusatory body.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.514" offset="1151551">In Douglas Oll, this Court again emphasized that the proper functioning of the grand jury depends on secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.055" offset="1197735">The government attempts to talk about Rule 6(e) and the rule of secrecy being merely a procedural rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.459" offset="1227411">Historically, that rule going back to the Middle Ages and the English institution which our Constitution Incorporated demonstrates that the purpose of the Incorporation of... of the requirement that a citizen, person, not be required to stand trial, not be required to be held to answer except upon indictment by a grand jury was to protect persons against abuses of in England the Crown, here the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.632" offset="1368054">That's supported by Edwards, the Grand Jury written in 1906, note 4 at page 27, a Michigan Law Review article by Richard Caukins, Grand Jury Secrecy, 63 Michigan Law Review 455, 457 (1965).</text>

            <text syncTime="341.805" offset="1504726">As this Court recognized in Nova Scotia where the violation has an impact on the grand jury's charging decision and therefore by implication and impact on the grand jury's independence, then the government has no right to hall a man into court.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.969" offset="1593438">Well, when you... but you are appealing to these great historical truths about the grand jury in the time of the Stuarts and the Tudors.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.740" offset="1624472">And there wasn't any Rule 6(e) then.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.359" offset="1634921">I mean, the general idea of overreaching and so forth suggests a real breach of some sort of very fundamental idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.530" offset="1667626">Rule 6(e) and some of the other rules are very kind of detailed prescriptions as to conduct in the... in the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.636" offset="1700122">For instance, to have two witnesses in the room at the same time or to have one witness read and then another witness read without excusing one is scarcely the sort of historical overreaching that you... that those authorities are talking about, I dare say.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard James Braun</label>
            <text syncTime="406.046" offset="1761667">Rule 6(d), the two witness in the grand jury rule... its purpose was to preserve grand jury secrecy, as Rule 6(e) more directly is.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="421.221" stopTime="432.279">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="421.221" offset="1822375">Well, do you think... do you think the... the examples one would call from the times of the Stuarts and the Tudors is that there were two witnesses in the grand jury room at the same time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_james_braun" startTime="432.279" stopTime="533.127">
            <label>Mr. Richard James Braun</label>
            <text syncTime="432.279" offset="1866679">No, Your Honor, I think that's a... a different question altogether, at least in... in terms of... of the particular facts Your Honor poses.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.504" offset="1911505">I think the rule going back to the Tudors, as illustrated by the Earl of Shaftesbury trial and the trial of Stephen College at Oxford which go back to 1681, was to allow the jury secrecy in which to interrogate witnesses so that they would be unaffected by the prosecutor, that is, the Crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.338" offset="2022891">Rule 6(e) codifies essentially what has been a historic practice of grand jury secrecy on which the grand jury's independence depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.027" offset="2065628">And for that reason, once the grand jury's independence has been eroded by government disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury, such as names of witnesses, what's occurred in connection with the grand jury investigation, the nature of the investigation, there is the potential for prejudice, the potential that such disclosures could affect the charging decision and erode the independence of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.313" offset="2182761">If that occurs, then the government is not entitled to put a man to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.283" offset="2202614">And therefore, the government cannot depend on merger for harmless error analysis when it's not even entitled to the subsequent proceeding on which it depends for merger, that is, the criminal trial.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="533.127" offset="2270010">Mr. Braun, have you alleged facts in this case that would even fit within the rule you propose for compromising the independence of the grand jury?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_james_braun" startTime="545.219" stopTime="653.689">
            <label>Mr. Richard James Braun</label>
            <text syncTime="545.219" offset="2318389">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.519" offset="2323613">In Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in Mechanik, the Court recognized that one of the purposes of grand jury secrecy was to encourage full disclosures by witnesses, participation by grand jurors and that adversely affecting the testimony of an important witness could prejudice the grand jury, undermine its independence, affect the charging decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.809" offset="2464779">In the case... in... in this particular case, after the improper disclosure, an individual named Leroy Krantz entered into a plea agreement with the United States, testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.069" offset="2529771">The grand jury, at least with respect to that transcript which we've seen, asked no questions and was... and was never asked a key question in the antitrust case whether or not there were... he entered into any agreements with the... with these defendants, who were later indicted... whether or not he entered into agreements to rig bids or raise prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.850" offset="2616916">Subsequently last August, we took his video tape deposition at the government's request, and he testified he had no such agreements with these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.623" offset="2655995">The grand jury was deprived of that testimony, perhaps in part because of the government's improper 6(e) disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.764" offset="2696537">The district court conducted no in camera review of the grand jury transcripts, gave the defendants no opportunity to show prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.489" offset="2747528">It was a pre-Nova Scotia case.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.689" offset="2752335">Well, do you think the... the motion and the argument that you make could be considered post judgment by the Court?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_james_braun" startTime="661.761" stopTime="699.267">
            <label>Mr. Richard James Braun</label>
            <text syncTime="661.761" offset="2784622">Yes, Your Honor, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.261" offset="2794549">I believe that under Nova Scotia, the error would not be deemed harmless and could be reviewed post judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.283" offset="2822656">However, because a grand jury with a lack of independence and where the charging decision is affected, I think the right at issue here is a right not to be held to answer at all absent a valid indictment by a grand jury that's independent and whose decision has not been compromised by the improper breach of secrecy by the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.712" offset="3008335">I agree with that analysis, and one has to weigh the value of the right not to be held to answer except in a valid indictment I think is a very, very important right.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.286" offset="3046682">And I think it's one akin to the previous cases in which this Court has found interlocutory appeal available, that is in Abney, the double jeopardy right.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.642" offset="3088060">That too could be reviewed after a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.713" offset="3104361">Vasquez, the discriminatory selection of grand jurors... that case involved a post-trial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.669" offset="3148246">But I don't think there's any question that this Court would entertain an interlocutory review of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.175" offset="3178235">The speech and debate clause issue under Heistoski could certainly be reviewed post trial, but the right is considered important enough to grant it interlocutory review.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.781" offset="3220658">And I think the Fifth Amendment right to be held to answer only upon the indictment of... of... of an independent and uncompromised grand jury is a right equally, if not more, important.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.219" offset="4090431">Of those 492, 328 were in the last two-year period of the study, 1978 and 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.356" offset="4730953">And I think for that reason, the importance of the right and the fact that, yeah, we're not opening the flood gates to an interminable number of appeals, that the right at issue... that is, the right to indictment only on the... on an independent and unbiased grand jury and the importance of maintaining that institution as a shield between the government and a potential accused... is important enough to justify interlocutory review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.567" offset="6691809">I believe counsel for Petitioners has made the case this afternoon artificially too easy for us because it is perfectly clear from this Court's cases that if, indeed, a Rule 6(e) claim is reviewable post conviction, that is the end of the analysis for purposes of the collateral order doctrine because the third prong of the collateral order doctrine requires that the error be "effectively unreviewable".</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.515" offset="6791597">If he's right that it's effectively reviewable, then he's wrong that it's subject to the collateral order doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.188" offset="6826287">He is... he hasn't admitted that it's effectively reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.906" offset="6837154">He's saying you can review whether it was right or wrong, but it's not effectively reviewable because you can't undo the trial which he... which he shouldn't have had to go through.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.500" offset="6911551">I think there's no support for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.952" offset="6921373">We'd like to, however, make the case harder and begin with the premise that Mechanik controls this case and that on conviction, not only would he have suffered through the process of... of going to trial, but that after tried and after conviction, he would be subject to the harmless error rule of Rule 52(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.743" offset="7072465">I suppose one possibility is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.560" offset="7079780">If a Rule 6(e) violation, a disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury, was so pervasive that it became in the nature of pretrial publicity so that a trial court or reviewing court lost confidence in the reliability of the verdict as a barometer of whether or not there was antecedent probable cause, then I suppose it would be the case that Mechanik would not control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.442" offset="7171313">But that would be true not by virtue of... of a Rule 6(e) error as such, but by virtue of its continuing effect on the petit jury, not on the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.093" offset="7277892">It does, indeed, serve purposes apart from what 6(d) serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.913" offset="7301193">On the other hand, it's not at all clear to me that to the extent it serves those other purposes, it conveys on a defendant the right to challenge his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.185" offset="7334317">I take it that the real lesson of Bank of Nova Scotia is not the lesson that my colleague draws, but the lesson, rather, that the defendant's ability, right, to challenge his indictment turns on the prejudice to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.910" offset="7381128">So, for example, Rule 6(e) unlike Rule 6(d) serves a number of systemic purposes: protecting the secrecy of witnesses, safeguarding the grand jurors' own rights to not have their names in the papers, so on... to be subject to harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.920" offset="7441210">But those aren't rights that I take it a defendant would have the right ever, pre or post conviction, to get his indictment dismissed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.358" offset="7474960">The only thing he can claim under Bank of Nova Scotia, as we read it, is that his grand jury presentation has been tainted, that the probable cause determination is unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.464" offset="7515398">And that is a claim that washes away, we believe, in Mechanik.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.368" offset="7530966">Now, of course, this Court doesn't ultimately have to resolve that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.987" offset="7545491">But on the assumption that it did wash away in Mechanik, become harmless as a matter of law, we believe nevertheless that the collateral order doctrine would not entitle the defendant in this case or any other to... to interlocutory review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.462" offset="7599407">I think it's very important to take into consideration here what exactly the claim of Rule 6(e) error is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.602" offset="7635979">And this returns, Justice O'Connor, to the question that you asked counsel earlier, whether he could say, based on the facts, that in fact there's a compromise of independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.173" offset="7670251">The answer is there isn't a ghost of a compromise of independence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.093" offset="7689895">The case is barely a... falls under 6(e) at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.529" offset="7703688">What you have here is basically a claim that the government attached a memorandum arising from civil litigation in which it revealed a witness who was going to be called before the grand jury, and revealed as well the nature of the grand jury investigation, all of which, as the district court properly found, had been revealed by Midland Asphalt in their own moving papers in that civil litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.775" offset="7788638">The fact that this is on its face essentially a frivolous claim is not the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.362" offset="7810999">The point is that claims like this are always available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.916" offset="7825210">Anybody can cook them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.783" offset="7832629">And the F. 2d volumes are chock full of motions just like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.654" offset="7848198">Now, counsel candidly acknowledges that his claim, in fact, is less substantial than many others he could imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.206" offset="7870349">He also suggests that in the final analysis, most of them will be found not to be very meritorious, and therefore we don't run the risk of having criminal prosecutions derailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.747" offset="7908488">But the fact of the matter is that all of these things can be alleged, and allegations are what get you into federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.150" offset="7934088">Allegations are what get you into the courts of appeals, and allegations are what brought this case to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.554" offset="7959793">It's... every grand jury case has not just 6(e) motions available to it, but claims that there's too much hearsay, claims that there's prosecutorial overreaching.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.012" offset="8113602">Let... if I can back up a moment, there... the Second Circuit has sort of flip-flopped on the issue of whether Rule 6 is... Rule 6(e) claims can be reviewable post conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.820" offset="8160831">Following their decision in Midland Asphalt in a case called United States v. Friedman, et al., they held in fact that a Rule 6(e) claim could not be reviewed post conviction in light of Mechanik.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.710" offset="8208374">So, it's unclear exactly what the state of the law is in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.912" offset="8221226">We believe that, in fact, for the reasons that the Chief Justice suggested before, that Mechanik would control this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.649" offset="8252155">But, Justice O'Connor, this Court doesn't have to resolve that today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.553" offset="8267724">Plainly, it Mechanik does not control and a Rule 6(e) claim survives the conviction, then the collateral order issue is... is quite an easy one, as I suggested at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.659" offset="8308162">We... we propose to... to defend the harder position because it's only that one that is plausibly controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.580" offset="8331881">If it does... if Mechanik does control and it is subject to the harmless error standard... and frankly, we believe that the logic of Mechanik does extend to Rule 6(e) claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.918" offset="8369184">If it controls, nevertheless there is not interlocutory review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.589" offset="8387887">The suggestion that has been made by counsel for Petitioners today is that, in fact, it's possible to narrow the class of... of orders subject to interlocutory review by subjecting it to a... to the following legal standard: whether the error somehow compromises the right to an independent grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.986" offset="8469494">Apparently, counsel believes that the claim in this case compromises an independent grand jury, and my guess, frankly, is that kind of contention can be made in almost every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.794" offset="8516723">There really isn't a limiting principle, and that in the end is the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.079" offset="8533860">Precisely as this Court said in the Cohen case that these decisions have to be made on a practical and not technical basis, we suggest that the practicalities cut against interlocutory review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.422" offset="8587254">Let me say also that the technicalities cut against interlocutory review as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.236" offset="9206460">Surely a claim that an indictment is legally insufficient is by far a more dramatic case of the violation of the grand jury clause than the claim that there has been some matters occurring before the grand jury that have been unfortunately leaked.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.806" offset="9736746">First and foremost, we think there's very little reason to believe that district judges get these decisions wrong very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.227" offset="9766421">After all, in order to... to win on a Rule 6(e) claim, what you have to show is that there was a 6(e) violation, and then you have to show that there was prejudice, prejudice in the Bank of Nova Scotia sense, prejudice, that is, in the sense that had this error not occurred, the grand jury would not have reached the decision that it reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.159" offset="9854193">Now, given that it's only a probable cause standard that the grand jury is charged with making a determination under, it follows we think that only truly egregious 6(e) violations are likely to allow a defendant to succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.823" offset="9936844">And we think that those kinds of errors are ones that district judges are not likely to overlook.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.775" offset="9952622">But apart from that, even that small class of erroneously denied 6(e) errors are unlikely in the experience of the courts of appeal to be subject to reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.147" offset="9998075">In fact, our research discloses no examples, before or after Mechanik, in which a court of appeals, reversing a district court, ordered an indictment to be dismissed under Rule 6(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.446" offset="12055270">Now, that sounds like a distinction without a difference, but we insist that it's a distinction with a legal significance at least in this Court's criminal cases, because as we read the criminal cases involving the interlocutory... the collateral order doctrine, for... in order for something to satisfy the third prong, to be effectively unreviewable, you have to be able to identify a substantive right at stake that entails a right not to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.299" offset="12166761">And it has never been held, as far as I know, in this Court's cases that the fact you cannot win your... in getting... when you get review, the fact that you can't win is not the barometer, is not the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.540" offset="12219737">That, after all, is the argument that the petitioners made in Stringfellow from two terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.510" offset="12239590">There an intervenor sought to enter an environmental lawsuit and was denied intervention of right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.618" offset="12287969">And he said, well, I ought to be able to take that to the court of appeals because after this lawsuit is over, no court of appeals is ever going to reverse this... this judgement just because I couldn't participate as freely as I would have liked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.009" offset="12337602">And... and I think the way he put it in argument before the Court was that his right to appeal was "academic" at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.864" offset="12373024">Now, he was probably right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.914" offset="12377203">Probably at the end of that lawsuit, a reviewing court, perhaps not his reviewing court, but most reviewing courts, would be reluctant to overturn a judgment simply because that litigant could not participate as much as he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.305" offset="12434777">But the fact is that this Court rejected that argument, rejected a similar argument in Richardson-Merrell, because the prospect of success is not the standard for deciding whether something is effectively unreviewable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.314" offset="12490784">If it were, we believe that a great many other errors which are essentially as unlikely to succeed, if not quite as unlikely to succeed, would fall within the same umbrella.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.872" offset="12536968">There is, we think, in the final analysis this central irony about Petitioners' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.943" offset="12561314">They contend that because a class of grand jury errors may one day turn out to be harmless, those errors must therefore be appealable at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.132" offset="12598095">That is, we submit, exactly the wrong inference to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.869" offset="12617007">An error is called harmless because it has no the decision of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.022" offset="12637592">And an error that has no bearing on guilt or innocence is a very poor candidate to add to that small class of cases... small class of decision that, as Cohen put it, are too important to be denied review at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.414" offset="12691195">For those reasons, we submit that the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing Petitioners' appeal for want of jurisdiction should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.757" offset="12748560">The government has indicated that it had some question about whether or not there was a 6(e) violation in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.879" offset="12788998">Let me address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.046" offset="12793700">Prior to the time of indictment, Midland and Litteer filed some grand jury motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.117" offset="12818046">There's an affidavit in the file that shows that we were personally assured by the clerk that those motions would be filed under 6(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.622" offset="12848034">Rule 6(e)(6) required them to be kept under 6(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.074" offset="12861827">The government responded to those motions, and they're all marked in re Antitrust Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.596" offset="12891920">And that was filed with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.132" offset="12902055">The clerk gave it a civil number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.615" offset="12908011">Some clerks around the country give them civil numbers, other give them miscellaneous number for matters related to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.904" offset="12941135">Then the grand jury returned an indictment against another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.224" offset="12966421">In responding to a motion in that criminal case, the government attached to that publicly filed motion in a criminal case its response to our grand jury motions pre-indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.565" offset="13015740">Six months later the same grand jury indicted the... the Petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.150" offset="13034131">What the government had filed in response to our grand jury motions in the publicly filed criminal case revealed the nature and extent of the grand jury investigation, the names of witnesses, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.259" offset="13094526">I don't think there can be any serious question that that violated 6(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.329" offset="13118872">Item number two, the government assumed that, for example, the purpose of 6(e), free and untrammeled disclosures by witnesses, is all in favor of the government, that it cannot favor the defense, that it can't favor a target.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.040" offset="13189716">A target, a subject of the grand jury, has just as great an interest in free and untrammeled disclosures, which are protected by 6(e), as the government does because sometimes those free and untrammeled disclosures, as in the Earl of Shaftesbury case, as in the trial of Stephen College at Oxford going back to 1681, exonerated a potential accused or... or target.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.823" offset="13288772">And... and so, a person under investigation by the grand jury has that same interest and can be just as prejudiced by persons because of grand jury leaks by the government are discouraged from making full and complete disclosures.</text>
