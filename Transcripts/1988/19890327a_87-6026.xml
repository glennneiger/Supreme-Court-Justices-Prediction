            <text syncTime="17.712" offset="212926">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.312" offset="223271">Heath Wilkins, acting pro se, pleaded guilty to having murdered Nancy Allen during a robbery of a liquor store dell in Clay County, Missouri, on July 27, 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.471" offset="271963">At that time heath Wilkins was 16 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.089" offset="286382">Approximately one year later, after a sentencing hearing at which both Heath Wilkins and the prosecuting attorney recommended the sentence of death, Heath was in fact sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.029" offset="330164">His sentence and conviction were affirmed by the Missouri Supreme Court on September 15, 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.551" offset="356286">The question raised in this Court is whether or not the imposition of the death penalty on one who committed his or her crime at the age of 16 violates the cruel and unusual clause of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.894" offset="417622">The answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.660" offset="424622">Given the well-recognized and fundamental differences between children and adults, the imposition of a death sentence on someone who committed a crime at the age of 16 would always offend our current and evolving standards of decency and would constitute excessive punishment since it would provide no measurable benefit to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.324" offset="499333">Under any accepted set of rules or standards, children are not small adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.128" offset="522529">While the varying maturity levels of the class of 16-year-olds is presented to the Court in the briefs and the Court may certainly consider that in rendering a decision, for purposes of this argument Petitioner is willing to assume that we are discussing only the most mature 16-year-olds, because even the most mature 16-year-old is still a child in every state in the United States and we as a society treat children differently than we do adults in virtually every area of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.111" offset="630467">The people of Missouri have certainly recognized that children are different, and speaking through their elected representatives they have passed more than 80 statutes restricting the rights and responsibilities of children based solely on the dates of their birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.805" offset="689295">Thus, in Missouri a 16-year-old child, no matter how mature he or she may be, is ineligible to vote, to serve on a jury, or to control his own business affairs or money.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.534" offset="776126">The people of Missouri have also recognized that children are in need of the kind of care, protection and control that could never be extended to adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.473" offset="811966">Thus, in Missouri a 16-year-old, no matter how mature he may be, can be forced to attend school.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.061" offset="834222">If he works, he can be forced to turn his earnings over to a parent or guardian, he can be denied entry into pool halls or other places of public entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.667" offset="876750">A 16-year-old can be taken into custody for being promiscuous or incorrigible or if he runs away from intolerable living conditions, and, if an adult decides it's in his own best interest, he can be forced to return to those intolerable living conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.028" offset="938190">The people of Missouri have also spoken at least tangentially on the issue of children and the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.682" offset="968805">A 16-year-old child in Missouri, no matter how mature he may be, is considered too young and impressionable to witness an execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.388" offset="1003600">As a plurality of this Court noted in Thompson versus Oklahoma last year, it would be truly ironic if the assumptions we so readily make about children as a class, the assumptions which provide the justification for each of Missouri's 80 age-based statutes, were suddenly unavailable in determining whether it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment to treat children as if they were adults for purposes of inflicting society's ultimate punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.601" offset="2440440">All of the objective indicators indicate that society recognizes and supports the notion that 16-year-olds are children and that by virtue of that fact alone are entitled to differential treatment from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.711" offset="2500835">The people of Missouri have never specifically permitted the execution of 16-year-old children.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.429" offset="2523718">Instead, the Attorney General is asking this Court to presume that because Missouri has a transfer statute which permits children as young as 14 to be transferred into the adult court system that the Missouri legislature made a considered judgment on the issue of executing 16-year-olds.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.040" offset="2590173">A majority of this Court has already rejected that reasoning and should do so again.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.461" offset="2611907">As Justice O'Connor noted in Thompson last year, there may be many reasons completely unrelated to the death penalty why a state legislature would provide as a general matter for the transfer of certain children out of the juvenile and into the adult court systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.804" offset="2677213">One reason, which is certainly apparent in Missouri, is that the present juvenile just ice system lacks the resources and the facilities to effectively deal with violent children or to protect society against those children.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.148" offset="2734578">The juvenile court in this case noted that when it transferred Heath Wilkins into the adult court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.867" offset="2757462">The juvenile court stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="655.753" offset="2765089">"The present juvenile system of rehabilitation and confinement lacks sufficient security to deal with the perpetrator who constitutes a threat to society and there are no adequate rehabilitative facilities available to the juvenile court should jurisdiction of the above-named juvenile be retained by the court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="673.615" offset="2836456">However, it must always be kept in mind that transferring a child, even a violent 16-year-old, from the juvenile court system into the adult court system does not transform that child into an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.256" offset="2883058">Thus, the 16-year-old being treated as if he were an adult is still denied most of the rights enjoyed by adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.493" offset="2912002">He can never be judged by a jury of his peers since his peers are considered too young to serve on juries.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.696" offset="3436854">The Attorney General's argument concerning age as a mitigator must fail for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.602" offset="3472485">It rests on the presupposition that 16-year-olds are in fact death-eligible and in that way begs the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.273" offset="3503101">Age as a mitigating factor is as available to the 60-year-old defendant as it is to the 16-year-old defendant, and thus tells us nothing about how young is too young to be put to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.564" offset="3548240">Finally, the Attorney General blurs the very real distinction between death and every other punishment available to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.669" offset="3576662">The fact that a particular 16-year-old needs or deserves confinement beyond his 18th birthday in no way provides a constitutional justification for executing that same 16-year-old.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.227" offset="3622951">The people of Missouri have never ascribed to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.814" offset="3649282">Since the death penalty was reinstituted in Missouri in 1977, 16 offenders who were 16 years old or younger have been transferred to adult courts and charged with first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.606" offset="3696407">Only one, Heath Wilkins, was sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.491" offset="3708005">No jury in Missouri has ever sentenced a person to death for a crime committed at the age of 16, despite having found transferees guilty of first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.929" offset="3749697">In addition, prosecutors are much more likely to waive the death penalty in cases involving those who committed their crimes at the age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.869" offset="3781462">In eight of those 16 cases, the defendant ultimately stood trial for first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.423" offset="3803718">In five of those eight cases the prosecutor waived the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.875" offset="3821481">Thus, in 64.5 percent of the cases involving those who committed their crimes at the age of 16 the death penalty was waived, and that compares to approximately 33 percent of the cases involving adults in which the death penalty was waived by the prosecutor.</text>

            <label>Mr. John M. Morris, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1540.713" offset="6304890">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.501" offset="6339999">The arguments presented in petitioner's brief and also by counsel for petitioner today resemble in some respects some of the arguments that might be offered to a legislature in deciding whether or not a categorical age limitation might be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.094" offset="6402379">But I would suggest to this Court that this Court is presented with two definite, specific, distinct issues in deciding whether or not this punishment violates categorically, for all persons at the age of 16 when they commit their murder, whether it violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.206" offset="6470820">The first of those questions is whether this Court can find an objective basis that there is a national consensus in opposition to the execution of those who commit murders at petitioner's age... in other words, whether this practice violates the evolving standards of decency, as it's been described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.834" offset="6541351">The second question is whether... it's been variously formulated, but I understand it to be whether this punishment is categorically, for persons of this class, excessive or disproportionate to the crime committed or other factors, in particular factors regarding penological justification, whether there was any measurable penological justification for the carrying out of such sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.133" offset="6642601">On the first of these questions, I submit that this Court's search for objective indicators is never going to be a scientific or quantitative sort of analysis, if for no other reason than because there is no absolutely and invariably reliable, objective indicator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.011" offset="6710102">Even legislation, which this Court has most frequently cited, is not always going to reflect the views of the public for the simple reason that legislators don't always necessarily vote according to the views of their constituents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.486" offset="6759943">They may and in many cases do vote the views of their own convictions or many other factors, and I submit that is particularly true in cases, such as those involving capital punishment, which involve questions of deep personal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.562" offset="6812293">But I think what can be done for this examination, although it can't be made scientific, is to apply the greatest rigor possible to examining these so-called objective indicators and seeing if they really are objective and, if so, why, and second I think to arrive at a measure of consistency in what one deems to be objective, an objective indicator of public views and what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.261" offset="6903094">Members of this Court have pointed out on repeated occasions that this Court, just from the nature of the institution, is not inherently well suited to judge the public mind, and for that reason I think the greatest possible care should be taken in this examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.902" offset="6953667">Beginning with the subject of legislation, I would respectfully disagree with my opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.473" offset="6979894">The number of states which would permit the execution of those of petitioner's age is not 18 but 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.959" offset="7001837">They are set out in Appendix B of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.744" offset="7013018">Four of those 22 states make an express reference in their capital punishment statutes to the question of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.350" offset="7047395">Three of those set a categorical floor of age 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.302" offset="7059202">The fourth sets a general age of 17, but allows for specific exception to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.171" offset="7078742">Now judging from this Court's opinions in Thompson v. Oklahoma it would seem that there would seem to be basic consensus that these statutes in which the age is referred to in the capital punishment statutes are objective indicators of public view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.181" offset="7138719">It would seem that the dispute comes in those remaining 18 jurisdictions, including Missouri, which have a juvenile transfer statute, a juvenile statute which sets a minimum age for prosecution, and that minimum age also serves as the age for execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.992" offset="7202040">The question as I would see it presented in Thompson is, can this Court disregard those 18 jurisdictions in judging evolving standards of decency on the theory that the legislatures in those states just simply didn't think about the subject of capital punishment when they passed those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.204" offset="7274869">Now I submit the question... the answer to that question is no for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.973" offset="7289915">First of all, we have specific evidence on the face of some of these statutes... five of the 18, to be exact... in which references are made in the juvenile statutes which we're examining either to capital punishment or to that state's version of capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.148" offset="7350624">I cited a particular pronounced example in my brief at pages 23 and 24, the Georgia... pardon me, the Florida juvenile statute, which is rife with references to the fact that a juvenile can receive the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.342" offset="7407362">I think it's awfully difficult to justify in the face of that evidence alone a proposition that one could ignore these juvenile statutes as a whole because the legislature just didn't think about this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.883" offset="7449576">In addition to that and apart from that I would offer additional evidence, which is admittedly less direct, which is the fact that the vast majority of these legislatures, the 18 juvenile states we're dealing with, 14 of the 18, have passed statutes in their capital punishment provisions which expressly recognize the importance of a connection between the defendant's age as a mitigating factor in capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.831" offset="7541318">Now I concede that none of these statutes make a reference to juvenile laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.867" offset="7557514">I've never contended otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.267" offset="7563052">But what I am saying is what we are encountering here is petitioner's desire to assume that the same connection between age and capital punishment was not made when the legislature passed their juvenile laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.460" offset="7611849">And I submit that that is at least a circumstantial indication that they made the same connection there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.261" offset="7631075">A second major reason why these 18 jurisdictions should not be overlooked in considering evolving standards of decency is that we have not just evidence of legislative contemplation of this subject, which I have mentioned already, but also actual exposure of the public to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.158" offset="7706621">The sentencing of persons to death at petitioner's age is not an academic consideration in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.662" offset="7732639">Since 1982 there have been 15 persons of that age sentenced to death in this country, of which eight were in jurisdictions with these juvenile statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.085" offset="7766389">I think this Court has acknowledged and should acknowledge that the acts of legislators reflect their public as a general proposition, and I would submit that that phenomenon cannot be deemed to have ceased once a law is passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.927" offset="7829710">If there is a law on the books which, in the words of the plurality in Thompson,</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.229" offset="7846951">"is abhorrent to the conscience of the community. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.848" offset="7853429">I would suggest that a reasonable conclusion exists that that law is not going to be on the books very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.669" offset="7876730">Yet... and I've cited in my brief, as a matter of fact, examples in which when a person of young age, and specifically age 15, has been sentenced to death in states and there have been repeated occasions when, very quickly in some cases, there has been adjustment upward of the minimum age in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.447" offset="7947783">Indiana, for example, sentenced a 15-year-old woman to death, and less than a year after that sentence that legislature passed a law setting the minimum age at 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.969" offset="7981951">But when you look at these eight states, not only of these states with actual experience in sentencing individuals of this age to death has made any change to its minimum age during the period I've been talking about, since 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.062" offset="8038271">Again, it is not direct evidence, but I submit that it is one more basis for saying that we can't... we cannot presume, as petitioner desires that we presume, that these statutes are simply irrelevant to the question of public views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.656" offset="8096681">Finally, I would suggest that it is simply counter-intuitive to presume that a legislature which passed a law which subjected juveniles to all adult criminal penalties somehow didn't contemplate that the death penalty was one of those penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.998" offset="8158017">Now it's true, as was stated by justice O'Connor in the concurrence of Thompson, that there could be many reasons apart from the death penalty why a particular minimum prosecution age might be set.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.287" offset="8195215">But if that is the case, and unless the legislature is oblivious to the question of capital punishment, there are many ways the legislature can take that fact into account, either by adjusting the prosecution age or by setting a separate capital punishment age, as some states have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.429" offset="8247773">But I submit that in order to assume that legislatures just didn't think about this thing you must, as a necessary inference, assure that the legislature didn't even know they had a capital punishment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.552" offset="8292286">And I submit that that is not a tenable or reasonable assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.421" offset="8303675">For all of these reasons, the respondent submits that the dominant fact when we are reviewing the question of public views in this country on this subject is that 22 of the 36 states in this country which have a death penalty statute have authorized the sentence of death in the situation in which petitioner finds himself, for capital murders committed at age 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.537" offset="8400224">I submit that even apart from the other factors which I will proceed to discuss that on its face demonstrates an absence of a national consensus in opposition to that punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.544" offset="8444214">I think it's a measure of the inconsistency of petitioner's position that petitioner attempts, while ignoring these 18 states which address this particular subject, attempts to rely upon statutes which have nothing to do with the subject of capital punishment or even criminal prosecution, for that matter, and I'm referring specifically to the voting and drinking and driving and so forth ages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.210" offset="8534911">What I would say about those statutes are two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.012" offset="8550062">First of all, they pertain to what they pertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.114" offset="8558526">There are ages ranges in every state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.483" offset="8572005">In Missouri there are age ranges all the way from 10 to 21 for different activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.118" offset="8586529">How does one possibly select one of those ages or one of those statutes and say that that statute has some pertinence to what the public feels about capital punishment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.873" offset="8621533">I submit that that connection is simply not makable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.158" offset="8634699">Even if... even aside from that, there is the fact that these statutes that petitioner is talking about are basically different in character from the kind of statutes we're dealing with in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.566" offset="8676286">In capital punishment statutes and as a general principle in juvenile statutes, we are dealing with an individualized consideration of the particular person at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.656" offset="8712649">We are dealing with a weighing of aggregating versus mitigating factors or the factors that the juvenile statutes prescribe which require consideration of various aspects of the youth in deciding whether he should be treated... whether or not he should be treated as an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.665" offset="8768655">That is not true of any of the statutes petitioner cites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.033" offset="8786209">They are class statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.250" offset="8791016">And inasmuch as we are already conducting in [inaudible] into these individuals, I don't see the relevance of class statutes in determining objective public standards of decency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.560" offset="8848276">I don't propose to go through and discuss each and every one of the purportedly objective factors cited by petitioner, but I would like to say a few words about jury verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.351" offset="8887460">In this Court's decisions of Furman, and Gregg, and Coker, this Court had before it some evidence not just of the pure number of those sentenced to the punishment which was being challenged but also the proportion of that number to the occasions on which this sentence was being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.579" offset="8968335">For example, in Gregg v. Georgia, justice Stewart mentioned in his plurality opinion that this Court had before it indications that of those cases in which a person was convicted of murder less than 20 percent were sentenced to death, and this figure was discussed as to whether it was relevant in indicating public views in support or opposition to capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.762" offset="9053076">After Coker, beginning in Enmund, we begin to see for the first time a reference to the raw number of those cases in which persons are sentenced to death for the class challenged as if that number on its face has some significance, and I submit that that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.021" offset="9118069">I think a good illustration comes from the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.556" offset="9132280">Again, since 1982 there have been 15 persons in this country of petitioner's age, including petitioner, who have been sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.595" offset="9164462">Now if that number comes from, let's say, 200 trials in which people of this age were convicted of a capital crime in which the death penalty was sought, then perhaps it certainly could be argued that there is a disproportionate reluctance on the part of sentencers to return a death sentence for people of petitioner's age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.457" offset="9231858">If, on the other hand, that number is 15 out of 30 trials, then I don't think that argument can be tenably made at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.695" offset="9256831">Petitioner has offered no evidence of the opportunity of sentencers to consider this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.098" offset="9278461">I have no figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.064" offset="9286298">The only figures I have been able to offer concern Missouri, and in the last 12 years that Missouri has had an operating death penalty we've had 138 cases in which the death penalty has been sought after a conviction of capital murder, and only three of those involved persons of petitioner's age or younger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.826" offset="9353380">Now I don't know if that can be extrapolated to other states or not, but if it can it might go a long way to explain why the number of those under sentence at petitioner's age is not very high and would have nothing to do with the proposition that those sentencers who consider the crimes committed by those of petitioner's age are reluctant to impose that penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2665.755" offset="10805057">And I submit that that sort of activity requires the most stringent care in determining that there really... the test, the objective factors that this Court is relying on really are objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.630" offset="10848524">If there isn't a national consensus against the execution of those of petitioner's age, that of course does not end the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.753" offset="10889066">This Court has said in its cases that even publicly approved punishments may be deemed to violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments if they are essentially excessive and disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.476" offset="10939953">In cases involving the facts of the crime, this Court has used that to derive qualitative distinctions between those sorts of activities which are proportionate for the death penalty and those which aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.570" offset="10996273">But this case, like Thompson, is not one of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.374" offset="11015499">It is a case in which we are dealing exclusively with characteristics of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.326" offset="11031382">And I submit to this Court that in that context and that context alone this proportionality analysis is virtually unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.181" offset="11058758">Defendants are sentenced to death because of what they did, not because of what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.233" offset="11078924">Now what they are, the kind of person they are, the kind of history they've had, is relevant to show why they did what they did and their culpability in doing what they've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.489" offset="11111943">But the core decision in sentencing is to consider what a person has done and his culpability in doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.011" offset="11142036">The decision as to what kind of person he is is one removed from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.213" offset="11162934">To give an illustration from this case, under Missouri law in order to be found guilty of first-degree murder one must act with deliberation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.996" offset="12794020">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.952" offset="12821814">First I would like to discuss something that Mr. Morris talked about, the lack of an objective basis for choosing an age, and then later on in his argument he spoke about and everyone on the Court seems to agree that there an age below which the states could not constitutionally execute a... someone for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.365" offset="12911466">Petitioner would argue that all the objective indicators in the society point to that age as being 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.954" offset="12941873">When you look at the vast majority of states set 18 as the age of emancipation, the international standard is clearly at 18, the American Bar Association has chosen 18, the American Law Institute has chosen 18, the National Council of Juvenile and Court Judges has chosen 18, the majority of courts which have specifically set an age set it at 18... that is 12 states have chosen that age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.021" offset="13050124">And when you just intuitively think about where it is that we draw the line between childhood and adulthood, the most common figure is in fact 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.346" offset="13099444">As to the states which don't specifically set an age limit and what he can presume and not presume from those statutes, I would point to the same statute that the Attorney General has pointed to, which is the Florida statute, and that statute states that a person, a child of any age shall be transferred up if charged with a capital crime and a person of any age, if found guilty of that crime, shall be sentenced as if that person were an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.967" offset="13229847">So that statute doesn't tell us anything about how young is too young to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.804" offset="13253253">Concerning the Missouri legislation that has taken place since Thompson there was in the juvenile Omnibus Act an insertion to set the minimum age at 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.596" offset="13300378">The legislature voted to remove that without consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.833" offset="13317409">They have simply not considered the question this term, and there is a House bill currently pending in the Missouri legislature but no action has been taken on that bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.877" offset="13393582">--When they were about to debate the Omnibus Juvenile bill there was a motion made to just simply remove the part of that bill that would have set the minimum age at 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.769" offset="13437155">That was voted on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.669" offset="13440707">That part, section of the bill was removed and it wasn't debated or considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.996" offset="13609981">I think that they are waiting for some guidance from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.464" offset="13619907">As far as the other sorts of class-based statutes such as voting age and setting juries, the relevance of those statutes indicates our, as a society's, attitude towards children and our belief that children are, as a class, less capable of making the sorts of mature determinations that are necessary to allow them to have the kinds of rights and responsibilities which we permit adults in the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.483" offset="13731920">And I think the Court should consider those statutes for that purpose as how they indicate society's attitudes towards children.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.600" offset="13844456">So all you are arguing here is you can do it for life but you can't execute, and that's seems to me to be, although you disclaim the argument that this is just a sympathy factor, it seems to me that that's exactly what the case is, because you hold the child responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.262" offset="13907045">You are willing to send the child to jail for life, which you would not do an insane person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.964" offset="13925853">For insane people we don't say... you just can't execute them if the person is insane at the time of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.144" offset="14010595">Petitioner's argument is that no 16-year-old can act with the level of moral culpability which should be required by a society before that person is executed, and that we require the highest level of moral culpability and responsibility before we would execute a person for a crime committed.</text>
