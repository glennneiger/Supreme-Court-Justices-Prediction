            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150181">We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1379, United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.450" offset="195948">Mr. Englert, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="69.907" offset="429796">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.319" offset="499386">The question presented in this case is whether an FBI rap sheet is exempt from the mandatory public disclosure provisions of the Freedom of Information Act on the ground that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of Exemption 7(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="106.890" offset="577649">Our position is that in this case and in many similar cases, the information should be held exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.645" offset="604712">The particular information at issue in this case pertains to a man named Charles Medico and consists of any information known to the FBI or the Justice Department regarding arrests, indictments, acquittals, convictions or sentences of Mr. Medico.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.025" offset="670227">The request was made in 1978 and was, in pertinent part, denied by the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.349" offset="695513">In 1979 the Respondents sued at this point purporting to limit their request to matters of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.246" offset="727069">The district court, after examining the records, if any, in camera, upheld the government's position holding after de novo review that there would, indeed, be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.205" offset="790912">The court of appeals reversed relying primarily on Respondent's purported limitation of the request to matters of public record, which the court of appeals said greatly reduced any cognizable privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.385" offset="843680">Judge Starr dissented and was joined in dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc by Judges Bork, Buckley and Sentelle.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.539" offset="872310">Most, though not all, of the records that would be responsive to Respondent's request are records of the Identification Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.326" offset="915464">The Identification Division has some 25 million arrest records that potentially could be affected by the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.014" offset="962171">Those records generally come in in the form of fingerprint data submitted by the states in connection with an arrest or some other state proceeding that causes the state to be interested in the identity, fingerprints and criminal record of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.206" offset="1038971">It is generally not the case, because there is no reason for it to be the case, that the states tell the FBI whether this information is public anywhere in the state, and the FBI has never had any reason to ask that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.285" offset="1091321">By providing centralized access to this compiled fingerprint information on individuals, the FBI makes available to the law enforcement community, which the Identification Division was formed to serve, a great deal of information that could not practically be obtained otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.088" offset="1178465">The records that are available in local jurisdictions generally are not indexed by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.096" offset="1210543">They're generally cumulative police blotters and things of that sort that are only useful if you know the precise date that you want to look at in order to find a particular piece of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.272" offset="1255265">They are generally not indexed by name and can't be accessed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.574" offset="1268431">The point of the FBI's rap sheet system is to make information available on the basis of names, fingerprints and other identifying information.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.360" offset="1303539">This is, of course, very helpful to law enforcement as it should be, but we think it's equally obvious that it also has a great potential for mischief if this kind of information should be given to someone who doesn't use it responsibly.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="300.679" offset="1352859">Mr. Englert, do you think there's any basis for drawing a distinction between past criminal convictions for which the common law generally supports the notion that is a matter of public record and public interest and arrests or indictments or other criminal investigation information that hasn't resulted in a conviction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roy_t_englert_jr" startTime="327.586" stopTime="435.235">
            <label>Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="327.586" offset="1460483">We certainly do think that there is a basis for drawing such a distinction, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.457" offset="1475948">And in the balancing process that properly informs the decision under the Freedom of Information Act whether to release this information, of course, one would more readily release conviction information than arrest information.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.806" offset="1525371">That is not to say that all conviction information should always be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.348" offset="1539477">We don't think it should by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.128" offset="1546687">But a conviction for murder yesterday obviously raises less of a privacy interest and it has more of a public interest than a conviction for... or an arrest, rather, for stealing bread 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.398" offset="1603739">The court of appeals denied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.040" offset="1610321">We don't see how... how that can be reasonably disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.001" offset="1626099">Now, the Identification Division's records are shared outside of the criminal justice community to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.528" offset="1664238">They are shared pursuant to specific statutory authority either by Congress, which has made the decision that this information should be shared with the nuclear power, securities and commodities industries, as well as the banking industry, or pursuant to state statutes that allow the sharing of information for licensing functions and employment and the like and that had been approved by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.276" offset="1767265">General public access is an entirely different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.249" offset="1787118">Congress has certainly never passed a statute specific to criminal history records that provide for general public access to these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.494" offset="1820137">We don't contend, on the other hand, before this Court that Congress has ever passed a statute that generally forbids access to criminal information records.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.999" offset="1854096">The D.C. Circuit once suggested the statute Congress had passed should be interpreted that way, but the D.C. Circuit... now it apparently takes the opposite view.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.855" offset="1885548">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="455.198" offset="1970916">I thought the whole... the whole underpinning of the First Amendment is that it's really impossible, or at least undesirable, for the government to determine what information is more desirable than other information.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.269" offset="2035177">And yet, you ask us to make a public interest determination as to whether a particular item of information is more useful to the citizenry than another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.986" offset="2074047">I'm not... I'm not inclined to want to make that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.749" offset="2273100">Information about someone who was recently nominated to the Cabinet, for example, is of much greater interest, much greater legitimate public interest, than information about my next door neighbor who lives in quiet anonymity.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.152" offset="2474765">If that is, indeed, a task beyond the capability of the courts, then we have a very real problem of inability to protect private information.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.197" offset="2506948">And I'm not sure that the solution is the one that the court of appeals adopted which is essentially to throw all sorts of things open.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.238" offset="4531125">And I gather that what that... what that represents is a sense of the Congress that if the thing isn't kept by name, it's not... it's not going to hurt you anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.627" offset="4588594">What about a... what about a rule that... that would say if the... if the information is... is on record out there before it's given to the FBI or whoever, but is not retained where it is kept by name, it is still considered to be private; but where it's retained by name, it isn't?</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.543" offset="4684307">Well, it's a very helpful rule if applied at a sufficient level of generality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.947" offset="4705936">One of the major problems we have with the approach of the court of appeals in this case is that the court of appeals apparently wants us in the name of the Freedom of Information Act to go find out in each and every instance where and how the record is kept, an entirely novel requirement of making the agency do research.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.417" offset="4775840">If the point is, however, that because criminal Justice records when... when available at the original source, which of course they aren't always, are generally not kept by name, that would, indeed, be consistent with at least one indication of the intent of Congress in the Privacy Act which suggests that there is a... there is a much greater privacy interest in information that can be retrieved by name than in the kind of obscure information that is available on police blotters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.651" offset="4976774">We know, often on the basis of information provided to us, that somebody is or is not famous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.366" offset="4999552">We know on the basis cf the records that his alleged crimes are or are not old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.060" offset="5022331">We know that they did or did not result in prosecution, a very important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.303" offset="5043334">What we don't know, with respect to any particular record, is what the disposition practices and what the availability practices are at the... at the original source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.920" offset="5089832">For example, one of the entries on William Medico's rap sheet, which was disclosed, shows that he was arrested for suspicion of murder on November 8, 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.997" offset="5134135">It shows nothing... no further action was taken on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.579" offset="5148450">How are we supposed to find out the availability of that 1928 record in Wyoming, Pennsylvania?</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.626" offset="5184604">We can always ask, and they can check their archives or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.258" offset="5203203">But it's a task that we don't think the Freedom of Information Act assigns to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.771" offset="5221175">It does assign to us and assigns to the courts reviewing de novo the task of making judgments on the basis of the available information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.035" offset="5250223">It's a very different task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.487" offset="5256075">The primary argument that is made by my opponents here today is there can be no privacy interest in these records because they are, as a general matter, public at the originating jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.408" offset="5323784">That assigns a meaning to privacy which we don't think is the meaning Congress had for that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.354" offset="5351579">Exemption 7(C) was passed in 1974 which was a time of extraordinary interest among commentators, courts and Congress in the invasions of privacy that can be occasioned by the widespread release of criminal history information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.151" offset="5414690">Congress held hearings on this subject in 1971, 1973 and 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.815" offset="5437365">At that those hearings, there was much comment on the invasion of privacy that could be occasioned by disseminating these records even though they may be publicly available at the originating jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.075" offset="5482400">Forty-two U.S.C. 3789(g) was passed in 1973.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.513" offset="5540183">The Privacy Act was contemporaneous with this amendment to the Freedom of Information Act of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.246" offset="5567141">It... its legislative history, as Judge Starr pointed out in dissent, shows a congressional concern with compilations of data and, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it... on its face it shows a concern with information that is retrievable by name which decidedly is not, for the most part, the information we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.650" offset="5644777">States do compile this information for their own purposes and make it retrievable by name, but as the amicus brief filed by Search Group points out, 47 out of the 50 States have statutes that forbid dissemination of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.727" offset="5697022">Now, I should hasten to say Congress has not passed a statute that in terms forbids the dissemination of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.493" offset="5724085">Congress has only passed a statute that says its law enforcement records are exempt from disclosure if that disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.682" offset="5840904">But the disclosure is governed by the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.575" offset="5856473">Before 1974, the D.C. Circuit had interpreted Exemption 7 to mean all law enforcement records were exempt, and the general assumption was that all rap sheets were exempt for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.790" offset="5897329">After Menard v. Mitchell, the assumption was that 28 U.S.C. 534, which provides for cancellation of the exchange with states, if the information is misused, was an Exemption 3 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.741" offset="5953126">The courts in the District of Columbia held that repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.652" offset="5960754">They held again that this information was not accessible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.084" offset="5974442">Now, we're in an era in which the only question left seems to be invasion of privacy, but we should not let the pendulum swing all the other way, as the D.C. Circuit has in this case, and say because Congress hasn't explicitly forbidden the disclosure of this information in all instances, it should be made available in virtually all instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.827" offset="6057407">Now, Respondents do say that there is a particular public interest in this case because there are connections to a corrupt Congressman and a defense contractor allegedly dominated by an organized crime figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.450" offset="6135879">The problem with their argument on the facts of this case is that it relies on too many tenuous inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.933" offset="6157822">The information requested is about Charles Medico, not Daniel Flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.528" offset="6176212">Daniel Flood was a member of Congress who was the subject of Mr. Schakne's investigation, but Mr. Schakne didn't request information on Flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.602" offset="6216545">This is about Charles Medico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.994" offset="6222083">Charles Medico is a principal of Medico Industries, but there is absolutely nothing in the record to suggest any connection between Charles Medico and organized crime other than having brothers who were allegedly connected to organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.762" offset="6277149">To say that everything about Charles Medico should be made publicly available and is a matter of great public interest just on those facts carries matters way too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.760" offset="6317169">We are discussing 7(C) not Exemption 6 here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.256" offset="6355203">There is a difference between those two exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.037" offset="6362308">Under Exemption C what we have to show is the disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy as opposed to our burden under Exemption 6 to show that disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.307" offset="6423330">Congress in 1974 in passing Exemption 7(C) and in 1976 in broadening Exemption C intended to put an additional thumb on the scale against disclosure of law enforcement records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.814" offset="6469410">All our position has to be to be upheld here is reasonable, a reasonable expectation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.492" offset="7004085">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.098" offset="7030521">One of the interesting things about this case that hasn't been mentioned this afternoon is that the government concedes that we would be entitled to any information about any financial crimes concerning Charles Medico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.016" offset="7086214">Indeed, in making that concession, the government didn't distinguish between convictions and arrests, and so the government concedes that on the facts of this case, we would be entitled to certain information pertaining to Mr. Medico's criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.455" offset="7143997">The question is how the government can draw the line between financial crimes and other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.780" offset="7169283">The facts of the case are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.982" offset="7182031">Robert Schakne was assigned by CBS News to investigate allegations of corruption that had been made against Congressman Daniel Flood who was at the time Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.982" offset="7234067">The U.S. Attorney was conducting an investigation that ultimately led to Flood's indictment on charges of perjury, bribery and conspiracy to solicit illegal campaign contributions from potential government contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.521" offset="7292163">Flood eventually pled guilty to the conspiracy charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.703" offset="7304911">In the course of his investigation, Schakne learned that Flood had been instrumental in arranging Defense Department contracts for a company called Medico Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.920" offset="7349841">And Schakne also learned that the Pennsylvania State Crime Commission had found that Medico Industries was a legitimate business that had received government contracts but that was dominated by organized crime figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.259" offset="7407206">At that point Mr. Schakne understandably figured he was onto something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.291" offset="7427268">A powerful Congressman was being investigated by the federal government for corruption in connection with his dealings with potential government contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.089" offset="7466452">And one of the government contractors that he had been dealing with was found by the Pennsylvania State Crime Commission to be dominated by organized crime figures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2777.781" offset="11261208">As a general matter, an individual has no substantial privacy interest in his criminal record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.972" offset="11330067">In this case, if Charles Medico had any substantial privacy interest in his criminal record to begin with, he lost it when he became a defense contractor with the help of corrupt Congressmen, and if he had any privacy interests left in his criminal record at that point, he lost it when the Pennsylvania Crime Commission issued a report saying that his company was dominated by organized crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.580" offset="12296493">The government is really espousing a view of privacy here which says that if something is embarrassing, it's private.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.047" offset="12338289">As the court of appeals said, that argument simply proves too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.699" offset="12352917">There are many things that are embarrassing, but they're not at all private.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.592" offset="12368486">We say that there has to be a reasonable expectation of privacy before someone can claim a privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.226" offset="12395027">That's basically what's required under the Fourth Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.378" offset="12407670">That's what's required under the common law cases involving invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.660" offset="12424806">And we can think of no other reason why, when the Court is construing the concept of privacy in the Freedom of Information Act, it should adopt any different test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.706" offset="12460960">I think it's somewhat surprising that in... in the government's reply brief, they seem to reject that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.820" offset="12485410">They seem to reject the notion that the test is whether or not there's a reasonable expectation of privacy, Now, we think that is the test, and we think there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in one's criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.488" offset="12532117">And, of course, I want to emphasize again we're not dealing in this case with criminal records in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.472" offset="12556045">We're dealing with the criminal records of a man named Charles Medico, a principal of a defense contractor that got its contracts with the help of a Congressman convicted of conspiracy to solicit illegal campaign contributions from government contractors, a principal of a government contractor that was found to be dominated by organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.876" offset="12641623">And those facts reduce any legitimate expectation of privacy that Mr. Medico might have had in his criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.943" offset="12669939">When the Pennsylvania Crime Commission came out, Mr. Medico should have expected the attention of prosecutors, the FBI, congressional committees and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.997" offset="12702122">To suggest that a reporter's request for his criminal record at that point was an intrusion into his right to be let alone I think simply ignores the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.102" offset="12742560">Now, the government concedes that there's a public interest in finding out whether Charles Medico had been convicted or even arrested of a financial crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.370" offset="12791565">But nowhere does the government explain to us why the public has an interest in that kind of information but not information on other kinds of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.886" offset="12825629">Why, for example, would the public have an interest in knowing whether Charles Medico was arrested for a financial crime but not in knowing whether or not he had been arrested or even convicted of murder, racketeering, tax evasion, mail fraud, or weapons violations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.634" offset="12884666">we're dealing with a contract that... contractor that sold missile parts and tank parts to the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.058" offset="12906400">We say that given the relationship of the Medicos to Congressman Flood and given the fact that their company had been found to be dominated by organized crime, the public was entitled to know whatever there was to know about the criminal associations of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.699" offset="12968885">As the court of appeals put it... and we agree with the court of appeals on this point... It's surely up to the citizenry, once informed, to determine the relevance of whatever criminal record there may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.466" offset="13007964">The government's position is, yes, there's a public interest in knowing what kind of people these were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.181" offset="13030847">Yes, there's a public interest in knowing whether or not they were convicted of financial crimes, but we, the government, will decide or the court will decide, based on an in camera submission, how probative or significant a particular piece of information is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.139" offset="13086645">We say that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.921" offset="13093854">We say it's wrong because the whole idea of FOIA is to give information to the public and to let the public decide for itself whether its government is functioning as it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.616" offset="13132620">That's not to say that it's always up to the public to make the final assessment of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.490" offset="13152055">But when, as in this case, there is concededly a legitimate public interest in certain type of information, namely, information about a person's criminal history, the public should have the opportunity to take a look at the information and to weigh the significance of each particular place of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.951" offset="13221959">When the court decides that issue on its own on the basis of an in camera submission, the adversarial process is compromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.016" offset="13254142">In this case the party advocating the public interest is at a disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.949" offset="13273890">Once again, that's not to say you can never have in camera review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.982" offset="13290086">But I think in camera review is a singularly inappropriate way to resolve issues of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.947" offset="13313910">I think it's difficult enough for the court to weigh what the public interest is in any of these cases, but to do it on its own without any help from the public itself I think is especially difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.264" offset="13359154">It's going to be awfully difficult for a court to sit there and speculate on its own looking at each piece of information how the public might use this fact, that fact and that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.119" offset="13402622">That's what the district court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.911" offset="13413802">It said, as the government says, there is a public interest in general in this kind of information in this kind of case, but taking a look at the particular facts that are in the sealed envelope, we don't think those facts are particularly relevant to the story that Mr. Schakne might want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.275" offset="13483183">I think the court of appeals had it right when it said that kind of a judgment is a judgment for editors or for members of the public, but not for judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.593" offset="13516516">A particular piece of information that is seemingly unimportant to the judge may be very important to the person who requests it and very important to the public, very important to the people who have a fuller understanding of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.168" offset="13566775">And even the fact that there is no significant crime in Charles Medico's past may be of legitimate interest in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.955" offset="13605959">The Pennsylvania Crime Commission raised serious questions about this company over whether it was suitable and fit to be a government contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.970" offset="13638037">If those questions were unfounded or if they were exaggerated, the public had an interest in knowing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.594" offset="13660503">And, of course, if the record shows that there are only minor offenses in Charles Medico's criminal past, disclosure of that fact is not going to cause any serious embarrassment to a person who has already been linked to organized crime in an official report.</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.236" offset="13843046">I think the court does have to ask and perhaps the Justice Department has to ask the requestor why do you want this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.771" offset="13877214">And if the requestor, as in this case, can articulate a legitimate public interest, that has to be weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.136" offset="13906681">I don't think the Court in this case has to write a treatise explaining everything that might be a conceivably important public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.660" offset="13936774">But no one disputes... the government doesn't even dispute... that the public interest that we've articulated is a legitimate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.515" offset="13964150">And so, once you have a legitimate public interest and a very minimal privacy interest, if any privacy interest, I say that the requestor is entitled to the information and the Court should not do what the district court did and what the government would ask this Court to do, go through the records page by page, line by line, and decide what's probative and what's not probative, what's significant and what's not significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.510" offset="14064147">I think that's wrong because it imposes a tremendous burden on the Justice Department and on the courts, but I think it's wrong more importantly because I think those judgments are judgments that the public should be able to make on their own once they're given the relevant facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3526.623" offset="14256617">It seems to me he still has some substantial residuum of a privacy interest in that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.264" offset="14275216">A ruling by this Court that there's no expectation of privacy in compiled criminal history records would come as a very great surprise to the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.932" offset="14321819">That may be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.063" offset="14326416">It's also true that every jurisdiction sharply restricts their availability in compiled form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.207" offset="14347001">To say that they should be available in compiled form because every state makes them available in uncompiled form is quite contrary to the actual policy of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.775" offset="14381273">According to Mr. Baine, the world is divided into things that are public and things that are private, and never the twain shall meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.696" offset="14404888">It doesn't work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.358" offset="14411575">Bankruptcies are fundamentally public events.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.829" offset="14421397">But under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, they can't be reported after seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.253" offset="14439161">Chief Justice Rehnquist gave an example to his Kansas lectures of the license plates of someone who parks at a bar every night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.308" offset="14471343">Those are certainly available to the public, and yet we would think there was some kind of invasion of privacy if the government came to that bar every night and recorded the license plates.</text>
