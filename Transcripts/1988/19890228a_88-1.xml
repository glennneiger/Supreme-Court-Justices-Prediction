            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149560">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-1, Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Railway Labor Executives' Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.622" offset="191983">Mr. Morikawa.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="11.805" stopTime="160.401">
            <label>Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa</label>
            <text syncTime="11.805" offset="196685">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.022" offset="197625">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.857" offset="208910">At issue today is the right of Conrail's Medical Department to continue its longstanding practice of establishing and maintaining the standards by which its employees will be deemed medically fit for duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.232" offset="262409">The standards have always included Conrail's right to require that its employees submit to physical examinations, the purpose of which is to determine these employees' fitness for duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.955" offset="305354">These examinations have routinely been required throughout Conrail's history as part of its regular business.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.359" offset="330954">The focal point of this litigation then is the addition by Conrail of a drug test to these routine physical fitness examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.132" offset="366063">It is our contention this morning that the addition of that drug test was at least arguably related to the general fitness for duty standards which Conrail had the right to maintain, as it had over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.042" offset="417681">And, as a result, the challenge by the unions to the addition of this drug test to the physical examinations represented a claim which should have been resolved in the statutory adjustment process of arbitration provided under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.901" offset="481106">We will demonstrate that the lower court exceeded the limited judicial role which the courts play in the process of determining the proper forum in which these disputes are to be resolved because in this case, we contend, that the lower court proceeded to decide the merits of the underlying dispute and in that process exceeded that role which the courts have clearly carved out in determining whether minor disputes exist in this... under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.404" offset="595104">Now, I'd like to take a moment to examine Conrail's longstanding medical fitness for duty practices that have existed since 1976, the year when Conrail was first created, because we believe that these facts amply demonstrate the particular reasons why Conrail contended in the first place that the addition of the drug test was clearly related to its fitness for duty determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.555" offset="699699">First of all, since 1976, at the time Conrail first came into existence, the railroad had a Medical Department which determined standards for employee fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.677" offset="740241">Throughout the history of Conrail the Medical Department has had the discretionary right to always determine fitness-for-duty standards, part of that being the inclusion of these kinds of physical examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.734" offset="788411">Not--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="160.401" offset="791127">Is this... is this pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, Mr. Morikawa?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="164.020" stopTime="183.684">

            <text syncTime="165.055" offset="809727">It was pursuant to the general policies that were implemented at the time that Conrail was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.109" offset="829893">But it was never bargained over with the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.642" offset="840029">In fact, the whole issue of medical fitness-for-duty standards has been a subject which traditionally in the railroad industry has not been a subject over which the railroads and the unions have bargained.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="183.684" stopTime="199.409">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="183.684" offset="884228">Mr. Morikawa, I gather that before 1987 the medical screening did not include testing for drug use except on the basis of particularized suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.593" offset="943891">Is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_j_morikawa" startTime="199.409" stopTime="211.853">
            <label>Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa</label>
            <text syncTime="199.409" offset="947131">The lower court in this case characterized the kind of drug testing that had been done as being done on particularized suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.449" offset="975343">And, frankly, your Honor, we're not quite clear what that term really means in the context of a physical examination.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="211.853" stopTime="215.221">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>

            <label>Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa</label>
            <text syncTime="215.221" offset="1010347">As a matter of fact, we believe that if you look into the practices of the parties that did exist, it included not just testing at the discretion of a physician, as in that situation, but it also included drug testing that had been done by Conrail on a broader base in 1984 when for a period of six months it implemented drug testing across the board and part of these routine physical examinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.753" offset="1104492">Do you see any limits on the tests that Conrail could require for medical testing?</text>
            <text syncTime="246.340" offset="1134899">Could it test... initiate testing for AIDS or pregnancy, for example, in the urine specimens without characterizing it as a major dispute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa</label>
            <text syncTime="259.850" offset="1188920">We contend that Conrail had the right to determine fitness for duty, as it had been its practice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis J. Morikawa</label>
            <text syncTime="265.452" offset="1211281">The question of whether or not AIDS relates to fitness for duty is certainly problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.889" offset="1229044">Or pregnancy, as to whether that relates to fitness for duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.258" offset="1242523">The question, however, is that the Medical Department has seen fit to develop various standards over the years which in its judgment it felt appropriate to the question of employee fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.363" offset="1282961">As a consequence of that, the Medical Department, we contend, has had the right and must continue to have the right, based on these practices, to be able to respond to emerging threats to employee fitness for duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.087" offset="1329877">And in this particular situation, whether or not pregnancy or AIDS would represent a fitness for duty threat we don't know at this point, but we believe that the Medical Department should have that right to make determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.264" offset="1382540">Now, I'd like to continue on--</text>

            <text syncTime="316.020" offset="1413573">One of the problems that occurred at the Chase, Maryland accident on January 4, 1987 was the discovery consequently by the National Transportation Safety Board that the Conrail engineer and breakman involved in that collision had been using marijuana just prior to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.946" offset="1477312">And I think this highlights one of the critical problems that we've had to face with respect to the drug issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.533" offset="1499673">I think it was quite well known at the time that when Ricky Gates, the engineer of that Conrail engine, left the Baltimore Yard he was seen by a trainmaster who testified later that Ricky Gates seemed normal, did not seem to have any apparent problem or difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.710" offset="1560381">And yet 15 minutes later the consequential crash occurred in the Northeast Corridor.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.197" offset="1582324">This highlighted in our minds the major problem that we had with respect to the question of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.850" offset="1604894">The difficulty of detecting drugs and yet its profound impact on employee fitness and on performance of our employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.430" offset="1887225">To give you one example, the issue of cocaine has always been a profound problem in the industry and in the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.018" offset="1917632">Only eight or nine years ago magazines were touting the fact that cocaine was a major new drug which had come on the scene and that people could use it and they could use it to their pleasure without worrying about the problems of addiction related to cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.110" offset="1973952">Seven or eight years later now, we now determine through the medical industry that cocaine... it may be the most addictive drug in the market today and may represent the greatest threat to employee fitness.</text>
