            <text syncTime="12.605" offset="195471">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.197" offset="209891">The questions presented in this case are answered by the language and the legislative history of ERISA and its predecessor statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.145" offset="253672">The statutes makes clear two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.816" offset="268300">One, a court reviewing an ERISA plan fiduciary's denial of benefits should defer to the fiduciary's decision absent an abuse of discretion by the fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.747" offset="328069">Two, a plan administrator should not be subject to personal liability for damages for failing to furnish documents to former employees who were not eligible for benefits and could not become eligible for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.988" offset="416989">Neither the Third Circuit nor Respondents are free to create new policies contrary to the intent of Congress as evidenced in the statute and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.762" offset="488147">The court... the case arose after Firestone sold its Plastic Division to a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum requiring Occidental to retain in its employ all of the employees in their same jobs at their same wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.956" offset="580829">They did not lose a day of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.392" offset="594622">Firestone then determined that these employees were not entitled to reduction in force or what we call RIF termination pay, and did not make that payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.887" offset="648643">The first question presented to this Court is who should make this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.541" offset="671213">Congress said in ERISA the plan fiduciary should make this decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.408" offset="1534717">But is... in deciding who is a beneficiary, I, I was not aware that trust law says the trustee has great discretion there.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Silberman</label>
            <text syncTime="1725.640" offset="7047598">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.774" offset="7112173">In light of the discussion to this point, it seems to me appropriate to begin by discussing precisely what it is the statute does and does not say on the specific question of the scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.863" offset="7156477">Section 402 is a section which says that every employee benefit plan must be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument, and in the second sentence, such instrument shall provide for one or more named fiduciaries who jointly or severally shall have authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.480" offset="7239024">The conference report on this section explains that a written plan is required so that employees may know who is responsible for operating the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.399" offset="7270684">And that's all that Section 402 has to say is you have to have a plan and it has to have a fiduciary named who's going to administer the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.191" offset="7301822">Section 503 says that every plan must include a claims procedure, and the claims procedure must afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim has been denied for full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.325" offset="7378309">And that's all that 503 has to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.527" offset="7387190">And that is all the Petitioner has to offer to say that the statute answers the question of what the appropriate scope of review is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.242" offset="7421985">Now, Petitioner's argument, as we understand it, really rests on an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.194" offset="7441838">The inference is that because Congress referred to these people as fiduciaries, it intended to bring with it the law of... the common law of trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.580" offset="7475380">And we believe that Petitioners' argument fails in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.235" offset="7490008">First, we think, as Justice Scalia developed it, Petitioner misunderstands trust law, that if trust law applies, we believe the court of appeals was correct here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.435" offset="7526789">And second, we submit that in any event, the inference does not withstand analysis as a matter of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.870" offset="7556568">The statute can't be read to require... if trust law provided such a rule of deference, the statute can't be read to so mandate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.835" offset="7588438">Let me turn first to what it is the trust law has to stay... say on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.599" offset="7607455">We believe the critical point is the one that Petitioners concede at page 9 of their reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.470" offset="7634936">Petitioner there says that we are correct when we say, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.673" offset="7655729">"that courts ordinarily determine the meaning of legal documents such as trust instruments. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.935" offset="7676836">And that is the essence of what trust law says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.857" offset="7688434">It says that if... it says that it's for a court to decide in the first instance whether a trust instrument confers on a trustee a mandatory power, that is to say a power the trustee has to exercise, a duty, or whether the instrument confers on the trustee a discretionary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.473" offset="7766906">And if it... if the court concludes that the instrument confers a mandatory power, the court will then mandate the trustee to act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.405" offset="7970661">I take it not there is no case that's just as good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.951" offset="7980901">So that we think that if trust law applies here, the court of appeals was quite right in saying that given that what we have here is, as Justice White developed at the very outset, a pure question of plan interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.025" offset="8033146">What does the word "reduction in force" in this document mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.149" offset="8045685">That... that's a question for the court to decide and not a question where the trust... the trustee or fiduciary prevails so long as he has offered a rational answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.596" offset="8087481">But if we're wrong about that, and if trust law is something other than what we understand it to be, we think in any event this statute does not require the Court to apply a rule of deference if that would be what trust law would answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.059" offset="8149339">And we think that three considerations lead us to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.184" offset="8165744">First, it's important to bear in mind that this is not a claim for breach of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.245" offset="8194060">This is not a trust law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.713" offset="8199912">ERISA does contain causes of action for breach of trust like the cause of action this Court, Court had before it in the Russell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.740" offset="8231990">That wasn't the claim we pled, that we brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.474" offset="8246932">ERISA has a separate cause of action to enforce the terms of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.127" offset="8269607">That's section 502(a)(1)(B), which is set out as appendix to our brief, and what it says is that a... creates a cause of action to "enforce"... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.152" offset="8325613">Why don't we just read it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.152" offset="8329688">"To recover benefits due under the terms of the plan or to enforce rights under the terms of the plan or to clarify rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.084" offset="8389352">That's the cause of action that we pled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.379" offset="8402622">It's the cause of action that the legislative history analogizes to a 301 Taft Hartley suit and instructs the Court to develop a federal common law, much as the Court has developed a federal common law of labor contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.014" offset="8457061">And it's the cause of action that this Court carefully distinguished in the Russell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.262" offset="8478064">In Russell, the Court said we're not going to give you in a breach of trust suit... we're not going to give you individual relief, compensatory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.509" offset="8511083">Your remedy is to bring a suit under the terms of the plan, and if you bring a suit under the terms of the plan, then in Russell's words, you can have</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.005" offset="8545042">"the merits of your application determined. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.254" offset="8558103">Or at another place in the opinion the Court says you can get a declaratory judgment as to whether you are</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.550" offset="8579210">"entitled to benefits under the provisions of the plan contract. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.234" offset="8598018">So, the, the claim we're bringing here under this statute is a... more of a contractual claim than a trust law claim, and we don't think that the Court in developing the federal common law is in any sense obligated to turn to trust law rather than to contract law to decide this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.259" offset="8674087">Now, the second reason why we think trust law shouldn't apply here is that trust law simply doesn't speak to the question that's posed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.521" offset="8707105">Trust law speaks to trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.910" offset="8716718">It defines the rights, the responsibilities, the roles of the Court in supervising a particular kind of fiduciary, a trustee who holds property for the benefit of another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.109" offset="11401479">I mean, I think as a practical matter, that's right in information sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.966" offset="11420914">In the claims procedure, however, it's not simply that there wouldn't be damages, that there wouldn't be any duty, that the employer would be the... the statute would mean that you have to have a claims procedure for those who are entitled to prevail, but not for other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.915" offset="11472741">Similar, the section which sets out fiduciary obligations, which say you owe an exclusive duty to participants, would mean you only owe a duty to those who you write... who you decide are participants, not to the people who are within the class who may or may not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.064" offset="11525300">So, I think the statute doesn't work all that well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.705" offset="11535853">I think it's terribly important that the Labor Department, which is charged with enforcing the statute, contemporaneously came to the view we urge in its regulations and said precisely what we urge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.715" offset="11587889">And finally, I think it's quite significant that the legislative history... that the legislative history points in the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.992" offset="11629058">And I want to... because it's not in our brief, but it's in an amicus brief of the Pension Rights Center... point out to the Court that when this statute was being considered, the Senate Finance Committee's bill, which was incorporated with the Labor Committee's bill to create the ultimate act... the Senate Finance Committee's report on its bill said that a plan beneficiary is an individual who is receiving or claims a right to receive benefits under a qualified plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.481" offset="11730936">And the language that the Senate Finance Committee was referring to was precisely the language that was enacted in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.636" offset="11755595">It was Section 501(g)(5) of the S. 1179, and it's now the definition of beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.446" offset="11778792">So, we think that the combination of the structure of the contemporaneous interpretation of the legislative history lead to at least the conclusion that Justice O'Connor states on the second issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.192" offset="11829783">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.746" offset="11900000">As the court below stated, this case involves a situation where every dollar saved by Firestone is a dollar in its pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.899" offset="11932601">And Firestone's construction of the terms of its severance pay plan not to require payments to the plaintiff class saved it more than 6 million dollars here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.427" offset="11970740">In a situation like this, deferring to Firestone's construction of the terms of its plan would undermine the most basic policy underlying ERISA, which is ensuring that employees get the benefits that they've been promised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.157" offset="12029672">Because Firestone administers its plan itself and pays benefits out of general assets rather than from a trust fund, the only approach that is consistent with ERISA's purposes and the rule that the United States believes should be adopted as a matter of federal common law under Section 502(a)(1)(B) is that contract principles govern here.</text>
