            <label>Mr. Thomas Greene</label>
            <text syncTime="16.176" offset="207311">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.478" offset="216506">This case comes to the Court today from the Ninth Circuit on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.829" offset="229881">The question presented today is whether state downstream purchaser remedies for victims of anticompetitive conduct are preempted by Section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.852" offset="266034">The lower court determined that these downstream purchaser remedies stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of federal antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.041" offset="298740">There was no assertion by the lower court that federal law occupies the field of antitrust, nor was there an explicit finding by the lower court that it was impossible for price fixers to pay both state sanctions and federal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.849" offset="349940">The issue before the court today is whether there is an irreconcilable conflict between state and federal law with respect to these remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.305" offset="383794">We believe the decision below warrants reversal for two major reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.358" offset="403961">The first of those is that the assertedly preemptive policies focused upon by the lower court were confined by their very terms, by the very terms of Illinois Brick and the legislative history of the federal antitrust laws to the Section 4 federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.552" offset="472820">As a consequence, there is no conflict in this case between Congressional policies and state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.789" offset="493718">Secondly, not only do state downstream purchaser remedies not frustrate the federal scheme, we believe that they indeed advance Congressional policies of deterrents and compensation for victims of price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.449" offset="548366">The lower court imputed three policies to Congress which assertedly preempted states' laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.119" offset="571040">Those were avoidance of unnecessarily complex litigation, creation of specific incentives for federal section 4 plaintiffs, and elimination of multiple liability for antitrust defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.077" offset="618896">With respect to complexity, our reading of this Court's decision in Illinois Brick is that the complexity concern was focused on the imposition of a burden upon federal plaintiffs to show that they had not passed on the anticompetitive injury further down the stream of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.503" offset="684621">We believe that states' laws do not alter that provision of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.857" offset="706041">We do not impose that burden upon them as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.793" offset="717744">Their federal remedy remains unimpugned and uncomplicated by any sort of pass-on determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.881" offset="746061">We do not perceive there to have been a Congressional policy, nor indeed a policy articulated by this Court in Illinois Brick with respect to some broader anti-complexity policy of the... in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.837" offset="789946">Even assuming that there were such a policy, we don't believe that that would be implicated by states' remedies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.974" offset="814501">First, pragmatically, since Illinois Brick's state downstream purchaser actions are being brought in state court in the states in which legislatures have indicated that they are willing to bear the burden, whatever that may be--</text>

            <text syncTime="285.934" offset="1286273">As a matter of state law, that would not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.003" offset="1298603">Perhaps the more analogous situation would be a situation in which a direct purchaser recovered under Section 4 and then you also had the imposition of state civil penalties, for example, the Henderson Brothers out of the... the Henderson Brothers decision out of the Second Circuit essentially, that kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.298" offset="1371745">But in terms of the... the direct purchaser coming again under state law, state law would not allow that.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.186" offset="1491282">So, we believe that this matter is given to the states and insofar as they exercise their judgment in that area, then that judgment should be respected.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.917" offset="1686260">For example, we don't know if that means, for example, that a contract claim, which is based on state law or a tort claim for an injury, a personal injury, would be bumped by the direct purchaser's claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.446" offset="1972353">It seems to me when a state adopts a tort provision providing for somebody to recover for injury caused, that state doesn't envision that... that the person recover again and again and again under the law of other states, and that's why the second state if... if the person having once recovered should seek to recover again by suing in another state under that state's tort law, the second state would say no, our law won't let you do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.504" offset="4516575">It follows that the policies to be taken into account in determining what a state statute... what a federal statute requires, which is what this Court was doing in Illinois Brick, can be quite different from the policies taken into account in determining what a federal statute forbids, what a federal statute permits the states to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.299" offset="4595778">That point deserves to be underlined especially in this case because both Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick were exclusively concerned with what Section 4 of the Clayton Act requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.206" offset="4635380">In answering that question the Court looked to a number of policies, not particularly closely grounded in the statutory language or legislative history, but of course that was legitimate because the statutory language and the legislative history provided very little guidance to the Court in how to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.950" offset="4694416">So, the Court looked to general concerns of compensation deterrence which appropriately inform the construction of how far the federal statute reaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.037" offset="4726704">To the extent there's ambiguity in the Clayton Act on those questions, it left, the field open for the court to impose... not to impose, to discern... rational policy in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.446" offset="4776336">In preemption cases the question is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.331" offset="4791905">Congressional ambiguities suggest that the states are free to do what they think is best.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.625" offset="6309097">This Court has twice determined that federal indirect purchaser litigation would have an impermissible impact on the enforcement of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.665" offset="6349221">In the words of Illinois Brick, the effectiveness of the antitrust treble damages action would be substantially reduced by adopting a rule that any party in the chair of distribution may sue to recover the fraction of the overcharge allegedly absorbed by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.994" offset="6422573">The state indirect purchaser laws at issue in this case authorize precisely such litigation and are preempted because they weaken antitrust enforcement in exactly the same manner and to an equal or even greater extent as the federal indirect purchaser claims rejected by Illinois Brick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.975" offset="6506479">There are two overriding issues that dominate this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.777" offset="6521734">The first is the effect, the pernicious effect of state indirect purchaser remedies on federal antitrust enforcement, and the second, of course, is whether those effects present an intolerable obstacle to the accomplishment of federal policy and trigger the preemptive force of the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.875" offset="6610132">Turning first to the effects of the state indirect purchaser remedies on the federal direct purchaser treble damage remedy, in this case a conflict between the state law and the federal law was inevitable because the state indirect purchaser laws reject, directly reject the federal approach to antitrust enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.408" offset="6708248">They are commonly referred to, these state laws, as Illinois Brick repealers, and the reason that they are referred to as Illinois Brick repealers is that by and large they were enacted for the purpose of overturning to the extent of indirect purchaser recovery under state law, this Court's decision in Illinois Brick.</text>

Hawaii versus Standard Oil is another...

            <text syncTime="2827.996" offset="11454593">If you have and if you assume... and I don't think that that's necessarily something that this Court ought to assume... in multiple complicated nationwide antitrust litigation where you're already talking about treble damages and you're already talking about a case which is in this one... and this case lasted 13 years and will probably go on for another decade... the resources that are drawn down from the defendant as a result of simple participating in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.279" offset="11555739">Yes, you may have some defendants that can afford that and then treble damages on top of it and then possible sextuple or rinetuple damages because under the state statutes, for example California's, it's not clear that the rule of Hanover Shoe, the pass-on might not be applied unequally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.025" offset="11638704">In other words, there may be 100 percent recovery, as there must be under Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe at the direct purchaser level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.548" offset="11668797">There may be if... if all of the overcharge was passed on, there may be to the first tier of indirect purchasers, there may be another 100 percent recovery trebled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.254" offset="11711638">There may be a third tier and a fourth tier and a fifth tier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.872" offset="11726057">That may not always be the case, but it's potentially the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.658" offset="11741208">If... if the pass-on is not handled equally, as this Court put it in Illinois Brick, that's very much the potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.347" offset="11779974">So, in those kind of cases, Chief Justice Rehnquist, there is a very strong possibility of a dilution of recovery by the direct purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.552" offset="11816754">And, what there will be for certain... and I've alluded to this... is that there will be multiple duplicative recoveries, almost invariably, because we know under Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick and direct purchasers have got to recover treble damages times the entire amount of the overcharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.199" offset="11895331">So that any recovery by any indirect purchaser is going to be an additional recovery for the same overcharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.287" offset="11923752">And that, as I understand it, is a policy that's strongly frowned upon under the antitrust laws by the teachings of this Court in Hawaii versus Standard Oil and various other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.010" offset="11970668">Thus, I think it's clear that the concern of the effect of the indirect purchaser remedy on federal antitrust litigation is every bit as great, if not more great in the state when the law... when the... the litigation is authorized by state law as it is... as it would be if it was authorized by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.376" offset="12064082">Now, the question is does that bring about a preemption in the operation of the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.197" offset="12083412">We submit that it most clearly does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.382" offset="12092085">In the first place, this Court has repeatedly... and there's no question... in this litigation that the standard for preemption that we're talking about in this case is obstacle preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.404" offset="12132209">Whether or not the state law... and there was some discussion when Mr. Greene was speaking about separate sovereign and a separate state remedy under a separate sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.545" offset="12184768">There's always, of course, going to be a separate sovereign when we're talking about preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.414" offset="12200232">And this Court has repeatedly held that where the state law provides an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, then there will be preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.637" offset="12245163">Recently this Court held in International Paper versus Aulette that the state law is also preempted if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to achieve its goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.731" offset="12301483">In that case, the Clean Water Act was involved, and in response to a point that Mr. Greene made, there's always the possibility or there's frequently the possibility that the states may argue that we're seeking to accomplish the same goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.824" offset="12357907">The litigants in that case made the same point in International Paper versus Aulette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.693" offset="12377342">We're seeking to accomplish the same goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.660" offset="12385179">Nonetheless the Court held that because the state remedy interfered with the effectiveness of the federal remedy, the state statute was preempted.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3070.350" offset="12423945">Are you helped at all, Mr. Olson, by our opinion in Boyle versus United Technologies.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="3076.420" stopTime="3253.603">
            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="3076.420" offset="12448291">I believe we're helped by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.856" offset="12454038">I believe that we're also helped by your very recent opinion in Wisconsin Public Industry versus Gould I believe it was in which a state court... a state statute there debarred a contractor if it had violated federal labor law on three separate occasions, and it was the unanimous opinion of the court in that case that the statute was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.353" offset="12544003">With respect to the Boyle case, I think the same... some of the same considerations apply, although we're talking about the... a federal statute here and the federal common law in the Boyle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.677" offset="12589248">But I think that the... much of the teachings of that case in terms of the analytical process of considering the effect of the state statute on the federal concern is very much apropos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.670" offset="12641283">The Illinois Brick concerns, contrary to what my opponents have said, are the concerns of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.157" offset="12667197">My opponents have repeatedly said in their briefs and even here today, that what the court was talking about in Illinois Brick was something removed from Congressional concerns, something on the order of Jurisprudential concerns for the efficiency of litigation in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.750" offset="12725607">But, as I go back and examine the decision in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick, it's very clear that the court there was articulating what Congressional policies are, and it is the law, of course, of the land, as this Court has explained it, that those are Congressional policies which are being undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.426" offset="12792271">In... it is interesting... and this is... I draw this from a footnote in the Associated General Contractors case... Senator Edmunds during the debates that led to the enactment of the Sherman Act specifically said if we want to entangle this legislation and make it difficult for it every to accomplish its objectives... and I'm not quoting, I'm paraphrasing... one of the ways in which we could do it is to invite everybody into the litigation, allow any party to participate in the litigation, and that will bring about the collapse of the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.718" offset="12937408">That's precisely what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.920" offset="12950260">As we've said the indirect purchaser litigation is a mechanism that as a matter of law substantially impairs the effectiveness of the private treble damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.745" offset="12997594">State remedies would be even worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.263" offset="13007625">They would be more complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.497" offset="13016611">They would bring about certain dilution of the recovery of direct purchasers in many cases, and the risk of dilution in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.785" offset="13041688">And it's the risk that should be of greatest concern because the risk of dilution of the recovery will be what deters the direct purchaser from bringing the antitrust remedy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.741" offset="13085574">And there will be a certainty of multiple overlapping recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.878" offset="13102083">For all of these reasons, the indirect purchaser legislation provides serious obstacles to the effectiveness of the enforcement of the direct purchaser remedy under the antitrust laws and is preempted.</text>
