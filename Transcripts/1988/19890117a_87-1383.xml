            <text syncTime="26.058" offset="254895">This case concerns the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the civil False Claims Act, Title 31 U.S.C. 3729.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.765" offset="297736">The district court invoked the Double Jeopardy Clause to bar a recovery by the government of penalties under the False Claims Act from Appellee who had previously been criminally convicted of making the same false claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.688" offset="369416">Appellee knowingly made 65 separate false claims under the Medicare program, each of which overcharged the government by $9.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.183" offset="407450">The False Claims Act provides a $2,000 mandatory penalty at the time that this action was brought for each such false claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.888" offset="446216">The government accordingly sought a penalty of $130,000 in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.792" offset="469831">The district court focused on the fact that Appellee's overpayment by the government was $585 from his 65 false claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.910" offset="510268">It compared the penalty to the loss and determined that in the factual setting of this case, the sanction amounted to a criminal penalty that could not be imposed in view of Appellee's previous criminal conviction and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.417" offset="564290">It therefore held the False Claims Act unconstitutional as applied to Appellee in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.743" offset="593651">We believe that the district court's analysis and conclusions are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.665" offset="613295">The False Claims Act has been on the books for 125 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.970" offset="630536">It has been upheld before by this Court against a double jeopardy challenge very similar to the one accepted by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.103" offset="659062">A statute very similar to the False Claims Act was upheld after that case in a similar double jeopardy challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.919" offset="694379">In the False Claims Act, Congress has provided a reasonable lump sum recovery for every false claim made on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.165" offset="727294">It is designed to cover reasonably anticipated losses in the average case.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.489" offset="748610">It is also designed to compensate the government for the costs of investigation and prosecution, which can be extremely heavy in ferreting out, detecting and bringing wrongdoers to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.978" offset="798556">Finally, it serves the purpose of deterring wrongdoers from committing false claims such as the kind that Appellee committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.053" offset="830843">It is not a criminal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.916" offset="850383">I mean, if there are 65 claims investigated, it wouldn't cost as much as to investigate just one.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.829" offset="942020">This case, although the facts surrounding the investigation are not in the record, does illustrate that there are very heavy costs involved in prosecuting Medicare fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.764" offset="1453707">And clearly, $2,000, as an estimate of what the government would have to devote in terms of resources to prosecute fraud, is reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.227" offset="1527581">It was amended in 1986, when Congress took a look at the False Claims Act, concluded that the $2,000 figure which had originally been set in 1863 had now been so eroded by inflation that it really was not fulfilling the purposes it was intended to fulfill.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.277" offset="1595813">And Congress accordingly did raise the figure that can be permitted for each false claim, and it allowed a certain amount of discretion to district courts to decide between $5,000 and $10,000 how much should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.966" offset="1646490">But Congress did take a look at the false claims amount and realized that $2,000 in 1863 dollars would now be about $18,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.173" offset="4727372">And there are going to be cases where the costs of prosecution do rise proportional to the amount of false claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.026" offset="4754748">So, for Congress to be limited in a way that requires it to reduce the government's compensation with the number of false claims may, in effect, deprive the government of full compensation in given cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.404" offset="4804277">So, the lump sum penalty does function, in the broad category of cases, to ensure that the government is recompensed for the costs of investigating these false claims and that it has a mechanism to ensure deterrence of the false claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.034" offset="4862791">We think that the consideration in the 1986 amendments of the penalty reflects a very recent congressional judgment that indeed the kinds of penalties involved in this case are civil and do not pose the double jeopardy problems that have been alluded to by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.297" offset="4935829">Congress specifically provided for a form of collateral estoppel between criminal convictions and the civil judgments which recognizes that it intended that one action follow the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.575" offset="4984939">It also recognized that in cases of Medicare fraud, there may be a very large number of false claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.389" offset="5008241">So, the congressional determination in this case was, indeed, that the statute be applied very much in the fashion that it was applied by the district court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.706" offset="5045543">If the district court's theory were adopted, the government would have virtually no way to ensure that it would be fully compensated when, as in this case, there are a great number of false claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.618" offset="5125165">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.581" offset="5148988">After punishing Mr. Halper with two years in prison and a $5,000 fine for his $585 in false claims, the government brought a second proceeding against him seeking a $130,000 penalty for those same false claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.722" offset="5209592">The district court correctly concluded that this would be punishing Halper twice for the same offense, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.549" offset="5252851">Now, the government does not dispute that the second proceeding was based on precisely the same false claims for which Halper had been previously convicted and punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.345" offset="5292035">Indeed, the government relied exclusively on Halper's prior criminal conviction to establish his liability in the second action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.191" offset="5327457">What the government says is that the $130,000 penalty should not be regarded as a second punishment because it served a remedial purpose, that of compensating the government for its losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.071" offset="5378970">But the facts belie that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.301" offset="5387852">A $130,000 recovery cannot be dismissed simply as compensation for $585 in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.027" offset="5422752">Nor is the answer any different if the government's costs of investigation and prosecution are factored into the equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.300" offset="5451904">The district court, which was intimately familiar with the details of Halper's fraud, the record in the case and all the judicial proceedings concluded that $16,000 would fully compensate the government for all its costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.258" offset="10867715">The government's focus on the distinction between criminal and civil is... is misdirected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.321" offset="10895927">Under the Double Jeopardy Clause, as this Court has frequently noted, there are three distinct protections: protects against a second prosecution after an acquittal, protects against a second prosecution after a conviction, and it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.635" offset="10965204">Now, when the first two of those protections are at issue, you need to know if it's a prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.767" offset="10993730">But when the third protection is at issue, you simply need to know if it's a multiple punishment, if he's being punished a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.974" offset="11022569">Finally, the government argues for reversal with a parade of... of horribles, all these routine civil sanctions after a conviction that will supposedly go out the door if the judgment is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.760" offset="11073664">For example, it cites in its reply brief debarment from further government contracting, loss of a professional license, disbarment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.609" offset="11121103">In each case, those sanctions can be justified with reference to a remedial objective: in the case of debarment, maintaining the integrity of the government contracting programs; in the case of disbarment, maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.007" offset="11178677">Here there is no remedial justification for the $130,000 penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.771" offset="11201769">It is punishment pure and simple.</text>
