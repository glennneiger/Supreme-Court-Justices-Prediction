            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="148685">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1729, Caplin &amp; Drysdale v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.070" offset="176897">Mr. Lockwood, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Van N. Lockwood</label>
            <text syncTime="11.122" offset="193093">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.010" offset="208662">The issue that the Court is faced with here today is whether the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984 and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution permit the federal government to deprive a... an unconvicted defendant of access to his assets to employ counsel to defend him against the very charges on which the proposed forfeiture in the indictment is based and to obtain necessary living expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="361217">The facts, briefly stated, in Caplin &amp; Drysdale are... is that the Petitioner, the law firm of Caplin &amp; Drysdale, was retained in the summer of 1983 by the Defendant Christopher Reckmeyer to represent him in a matter then understood to be a grand jury investigation involving possible federal tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.148" offset="453273">In January of 1985, Reckmeyer was indicted for not only a multiplicity of tax crimes, but a multiplicity of drug crimes and a... charged with a violation of the Continuing Criminal Enterprise statute or CCE.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.110" offset="525057">The indictment also contained what I will refer to in shorthand as blanket forfeiture allegations which essentially sought forfeiture of every asset Reckmeyer owned that was worth more than $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.035" offset="584825">Approximately simultaneously with the entry of the indictment, the government, ex parte, obtained a temporary restraining order against Reckmeyer and all persons acting in concert with him from transferring any of the assets listed as forfeitable in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.933" offset="660372">Immediately prior to the indictment, Reckmeyer had paid Caplin &amp; Drysdale $10,000 by check for previously incurred legal fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.039" offset="700809">That check... those checks were returned unpaid by the banks as a result of the restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.542" offset="726827">Shortly after the indictment, Reckmeyer paid Caplin &amp; Drysdale approximately $25,000 in cash, again for previous... pre-indictment legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.368" offset="778132">Because of the restraining order, Caplin &amp; Drysdale deposited that money in an escrow account and immediately notified both the court and the government of its receipt of those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.908" offset="820241">Thereafter, Caplin &amp; Drysdale continued to represent Reckmeyer in the criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.164" offset="845318">Some weeks after the indictment, Caplin &amp; Drysdale filed on Reckmeyer's behalf a motion with the district court for... to amend the temporary restraining order to allow Reckmayer access to his restrained assets to pay counsel and, in addition, requested that the assets so relieved from restraint would be exempted from subsequent forfeiture in the event Reckmeyer should be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.747" offset="959630">That motion came on for a hearing, but the day prior to the hearing, Reckmeyer pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.837" offset="992022">As a result, the district court deferred ruling on the motion to some post-conviction procedures under Subsection N(2) of the CCE forfeiture statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.096" offset="1053044">At that subsequent... subsequent hearing, Caplin &amp; Drysdale at this point, petitioning on its own behalf for the fees, pursuant to the court's instruction... and the court granted Caplin &amp; Drysdale's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.558" offset="1122843">In the interim, while those proceedings were transpiring, Reckmeyer also consented to the entry of a forfeiture decree against him, which once again covered all the assets listed in the indictment and included the bank accounts on which the $10,000 in unpaid checks were drawn and the 25,000 odd dollars that was in the possession of Caplin &amp; Drysdale in the escrow account.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.632" offset="1479154">For example, if an enterprise is a legitimate business, but the defendant participated in two or more predicate crimes which were deemed to be a pattern of racketeering activity, the defendant's entire interest in the enterprise could be forfeited, not merely that portion of the enterprise's assets that resulted from the criminal activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.096" offset="1660966">The... we believe there are certain basic principles that have to be kept in mind in evaluating the arguments over whether or not the lower court was correct in ruling that Caplin &amp; Drysdale should be paid the legal fees from Reckmeyer's assets that it had earned, or whether the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit en banc was correct in holding that neither the statute nor the... the applicable constitutional provisions authorize such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.317" offset="1801923">The first point is that, unlike the government's argument at various places in its brief which suggests that this is simply a dispute over property rights, forfeiture is a criminal penalty in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.010" offset="1860646">It is imposed only upon conviction of the defendant and is... it was enacted as an effort to punish the defendant for his wrongful conduct and deter others from engaging in similar conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.269" offset="1917697">The restraining order provisions in both the CCE and the RICO statutes were intended by Congress... this much both sides agree on... to prevent a defendant from avoiding the impact of forfeiture by disposing of his property prior to forfeiture but after indictment in a manner which would, for example, allow him to retain the economic and beneficial ownership of that property, which we would refer to as a sham transaction, or which would enable his organization... the statute... these statutes were, after all, aimed at criminal organizations... to maintain its continued use of the assets in criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.917" offset="2100345">This would be involved in transferring assets to other members of the criminal organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.430" offset="2190311">I was about to say that the... the disagreement between the parties has to do with how much farther Congress intended to go than those basic purposes and specifically whether Congress intended that the government, by indicting a defendant and including blanket forfeiture allegations, could in fact render a defendant functionally indigent prior to the time of his conviction for the offenses on which the forfeiture charges were based.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="1655.855" offset="6772084">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.707" offset="6783474">At the outset, I'd like to make a couple of points applicable to both of the cases before Court today, and then turn to the Caplin &amp; Drysdale case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.646" offset="6815238">First, it is important I think to point out the procedural posture that these two cases present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.067" offset="6844914">There are two basic issues that have been litigated in the so-called attorneys' fee forfeiture cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.571" offset="6870932">One is the substantive question, which is the question that is presented in these cases, of whether funds that a defendant wishes to use to pay an attorney may be forfeited at all, consistent with the statute and the Sixth Amendment, and the second is a procedural question which is not presented in this... these cases, but has come up in other cases, involving what kind of procedures the courts must go through, if any, to establish the right to a forfeiture, that is to say, should... must there be a pretrial hearing of some sort and what must that hearing consist in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.913" offset="7016277">Now, the reason, of course, that these two cases don't present the procedural point is simply that in the Caplin &amp; Drysdale case, there was a guilty plea simultaneously with the motion to modify the restraining order and, therefore, we know as of the time that the restraining order modification motion was filed, that the defendant was, in fact, guilty of the crimes and that he, in fact, was subject to the forfeiture provisions with respect to all of the property that he conceded was forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.169" offset="7157338">And in the Monsanto case, the court of appeals panel required and the district court held a pretrial hearing long before any counsel had to prepare for the trial in which it was determined, as the district court found, by overwhelming evidence that the defendant had committed the crimes and that the property was forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.617" offset="7251065">So... so, these cases present the substantive question in a very stark posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.919" offset="7272277">They present the question whether... that if we know to either a certainty or by overwhelming likelihood that the fees are... excuse me... that the... the property in issue is subject to forfeiture, must that property nonetheless be excluded from a forfeiture order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.615" offset="7343121">And our position on that is that neither statute nor the Sixth Amendment requires that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.586" offset="11255010">Now, on the constitutional question... and let me... let me turn directly to that... it is our view that the Sixth Amendment requires only... with respect to the right to counsel of choice, only that there be no arbitrary or unreasonable limitation of the right to counsel of choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.655" offset="11375278">And the question then in this case is does the forfeiture statute operate in a way that is somehow arbitrary or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.229" offset="11417596">And what in this context the question really comes down to is is it arbitrary or unreasonable to bar defendants from using to pay lawyers' fees money that has been determined, as in these cases, either conclusively or by overwhelming evidence to be subject to forfeiture, to be, in other words, the government's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.078" offset="11508920">Now, the first question I guess one could start with is to say is there any constitutional flaw in the process of... or in... in the fact of determining that this is, in fact, the tainted money, money that was obtained as a result of drug transactions, is forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.873" offset="11584153">Is there any Fifth Amendment bar to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.758" offset="11591676">Now, Mr. Lockwood said, and quite correctly, the government couldn't simply... the Congress couldn't simply declare that Mr. Lockwood's funds are forfeitable, all of his property is forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.681" offset="11631382">But what we submit there would be absolutely no Fifth Amendment bar to is a rule that says any of his property that are the proceeds of drug transactions are forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.703" offset="11667431">And that's a... a traditional civil notion, and it is, we... we'd submit, entirely consistent with the Fifth Amendment to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.642" offset="11703167">That's what Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.261" offset="11709645">Now, once you accepted that it is permissible, then the only remaining question is whether there is something arbitrary about saying that the defendant cannot use those funds, funds that the government... that Congress has declared belong to the government, to hire a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.556" offset="11790834">There is, in our view, no Sixth Amendment right to use somebody else's property to hire a lawyer, and that's what's going on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.280" offset="11837749">As I say, we have in this case established with a high degree of confidence that this is the government's property, and that is what the defendants are contending for is that even though the government has established that it is government property, they are entitled to dip into that property to the extent necessary to hire the lawyers of their choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3437.747" offset="13899647">Your Honor, counsel for the government has persistently attempted to suggest that the Caplin &amp; Drysdale case is unusual because the... it involves a situation where at the time the defendant was deprived of the ability to pay his lawyer, the government had proven or had a high degree of certainty that the assets were forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.828" offset="13983970">That is simply not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.762" offset="13995673">What is the case is that it was proven after the services were rendered that the assets were forfeitable by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.118" offset="14025139">But if you... if you posited that Caplin &amp; Drysdale had been paid as it went along, because there was no restraining order, then we would not have received any money prior to the time of the... at which the government knew to be forfeitable or the court knew to be forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.544" offset="14094834">But under 853(c), the relation-back doctrine, the... the government would be here arguing we would have to give it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.233" offset="14121583">The question, therefore, is... is... is whether or not the fact that Caplin &amp; Drysdale, as part of its ethical obligation to its client, agreed to proceed forward and represent him without having been paid, should now be penalized for having done so or, alternatively, should have given into a conflict of interest and said to the defendant don't plead guilty on March the 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.599" offset="14219072">We've got a hearing on March 15th on our fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.086" offset="14241015">And maybe the government will withdraw the guilty plea offer if we don't take it today, but that's not really very important because it's more important that we get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.191" offset="14277377">That is, it seems to me, an extremely harsh and unjustified rule to try and single out Caplin &amp; Drysdale from all other lawyers that could come in here and make an argument--</text>
