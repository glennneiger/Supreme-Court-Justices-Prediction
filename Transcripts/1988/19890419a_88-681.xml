            <text syncTime="28.483" offset="251348">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="33.064" offset="269634">At issue in this case is a proper interface between Federal bankruptcy power and the fundamental sovereign rights of the states to tax commerce and property within their borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.019" offset="305474">The case concerns the Ninth Circuit's holding that a state may not tax a private party's subsequent commercial rentals of property purchased at a bankruptcy liquidation sale by reason of the purported preemptive effect of 28 U.S.C. Section 960 and the purported unconstitutional interference such taxation is seen as imposing upon the bankruptcy processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.924" offset="389065">The state contends that this ruling is in error for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.827" offset="404739">First, whatever it is, Section 960 is obviously not a clear expression of preemptive intent stated to be necessary to preempt state taxation under this Court's ruling in Swarts v. Hammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.085" offset="453745">Second, whatever the limits of intergovernmental immunity, the imposition of a nondiscriminatory tax on a liquidation sale or the purchaser therefrom certainly does not cross them.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.852" offset="496794">Third, whatever the limits of bankruptcy jurisdiction, a bankruptcy court clearly has no jurisdiction to adjudicate a controversy between a state and a nonbankruptcy party concerning the taxability of transactions occurring long after the bankruptcy is closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.047" offset="649558">Yes, I do, for the simple reason that the injunction is circumscribed by the judgment underlying it and that judgment in turn is circumscribed by the pleadings brought by the parties underlying the adversary complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.045" offset="697624">That pleading, in turn, was brought by the debtor... if one will... or the trustee, state receiver's, under Bankruptcy Code Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.811" offset="740674">In turn, Bankruptcy Code Section 505 only allows adjudication of the debtor and the estate's rights... tax rights and obligations... on property in the bankruptcy estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.045" offset="2733607">But one still ends up with the question of whether or not there is a conflict between the fundamental purposes of the Bankruptcy Code and the efforts of the state to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.005" offset="2793376">It's essentially a Tenth Amendment analysis at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.469" offset="2803302">Going back, the immediate reason for enactment of 960 by Congress was simple: to clarify previously confused law in an area by providing a rule of construction whereby the taxability of an activity conducted under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court would be determined by reference to state law rather than by distinguishing whether or not it was conducted by a trustee or receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.213" offset="2902254">My opponents assert that 960 was meant to have preemptive intent with regard to state taxation of liquidating activities by Congress' inclusion of language, "conduct of business" within the terminology of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.972" offset="2961291">They argue that that terminology was meant to resurrect and maintain a pre-act distinction in the act between liquidating and nonliquidating activities and by innuendo to retain a purported bar to state and Federal taxation on liquidation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.274" offset="3018447">The argument's invalid for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.174" offset="3030150">First, It's factually incorrect, for even assuming that such a distinction was made under the act, there was no bar on taxation of liquidation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.269" offset="3066512">The Hendersonville case cited in my brief amply demonstrates that a taxation on property held in the liquidating state was taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.055" offset="3101621">Similarly, the Mason/Tire case, although ultimately holding that no tax was due, found that there was no immunity to such taxation but found that as a matter of construction of Ohio law that a personal property tax on the monetary proceeds from a liquidation sale was not due and owing under Ohio law, as a matter of Ohio construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.141" offset="3189914">The argument ultimately rests on a totally improper preemption analysis posited by negative innuendo from what is otherwise an affirmative statement of tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.047" offset="3233591">As before, Swarts demands a clear expression of Congressional preemptive intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.350" offset="3254803">Swarts is in line with the recent cases by this Court, most recently exemplified by the Puerto Rico decision cited in my brief, holding essentially that the states' exercise of their sovereign rights may be abridged only by the clear and direct statement of congressional intent to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.110" offset="3309869">Here we are talking, of course, the most fundamental of those rights essentially, the state's very existence... the right to tax to create the lifeblood by which the services and protections demanded by bankruptcy estates are provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.589" offset="3359710">The clear expression here is asserted to lie in hidden subtlety of meaning, a purported term of arts, but it Congress meant a preemptive effect to take place here, it should have said so in direct language, such as doing business, except that the estate shall not be liable for any state, local or Federal tax on liquidation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.533" offset="3443511">Congress intended to create a level playing field, and at worst it left one ambiguity as to the extent of that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.699" offset="3480187">That the ambiguity exists is demonstrated by the fact that I stand in front of the Court today, for the conflict of the circuits essentially created the jurisdiction of this Court and the fact that you have a myriad of cases cited on both sides, by both myself and my opponents, as to whether or not Section 960 includes liquidating activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.824" offset="3568690">In practical terms, the Ninth Circuit's construction differentiating liquidating activities from the definition of business leads to absurd results and creates a rule which is both impossible to consistently and rationally apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.412" offset="3619054">The inconsistent application of this rule is most amply demonstrated within the Ninth Circuit itself, for in United States v. Sampsell, considering Federal taxation of liquidating activities, the Ninth Circuit held that liquidating activities are included within the ambit of 960.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.894" offset="3692928">Now, there's no rational differentiation one can make between Federal and state taxation for the purposes of the instant analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.889" offset="3720932">The Code at least, and the act since 1850, certainly made no distinction between Federal and state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.965" offset="3749248">And the fact that one is undertaken under a supremacy clause analysis, whereas the other one is under statutory construction, is really of no regard, for the analysis is the same: harmonization to avoid conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.693" offset="3796164">If in fact... I would note that the contrary construction to the Ninth Circuit's analysis is one of common commercial usage and is one given terms in other statutes such as the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.863" offset="3856873">This Court noted in Magruder, cited in my brief, that the term "doing business" is one of broad import, fairly limitless, and specifically stated that liquidation activities were included within that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.951" offset="3913193">Obviously Sampsell stands for the same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.345" offset="3926776">But perhaps the greatest fault of the Goggins rules is the fact that there's no rational test for differentiate... by which one can differentiate liquidating from nonliquidating activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.571" offset="3971707">In this case, China Peak is a debtor in possession operated by a state receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.143" offset="3989993">It filed a bankruptcy proceeding to essentially gain protection from the state receivership and then dismissed it shortly after the liquidation sale... or what was termed a liquidation sale... took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.411" offset="4038998">It was filed under Chapter 11, but no plan was ever filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.453" offset="4051224">No trustee was ever appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.087" offset="4061777">It was never adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.128" offset="4069927">It was not brought under Chapter 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.688" offset="4076197">It was not even what would now be termed as a liquidating 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.680" offset="4088109">The sale was not for the benefit of the creditors of the estate but, by order of the Bankruptcy Court, was passed directly through to the state receivership to be distributed by the state receivership to whatever creditors or persons were deemed worthy of receipt therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.040" offset="4149549">The sale here, because it was done in bankruptcy, was felt to be a liquidation sale and because of that was exempt from the same taxation given for the benefit of the state receivership, which would have borne it in the first place, had it been conducted by it directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.032" offset="4213496">The Goggin cases are also good examples of the problem with the Goggin rules, for there, Mr. Goggin as trustee took a debtor's inventory, consisting of partly finished goods, utilized the debtor's work force and plant to continue finishing those goods and then sold them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.895" offset="4296984">Obviously, that is the normal course of business operations for the debtor, or under any common construction of the term and phrase, yet it was held to be a liquidation and thus immune from state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.403" offset="4338989">The Oklahoma trustee amicus here, by analogy, argues that, as long as he is not operating under an order under Section 721, that he should be regarded as a liquidator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.561" offset="4383606">But consider the amicus banks, who argue that receivership should be taken as liquidating entitles also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.396" offset="4410982">This Court has previously refused to draw such a distinction in Michigan v. Michigan Trust, where a liquidating receivership, if one will, was still held to be a receivership and properly subject to state taxation on receivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.754" offset="4468452">But perhaps the most pernicious hypothetical that one can draw is in fact a Chapter 11 11&gt; ["] by a retail grocery chain or hotel chain consisting of a... of a multiple series of outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.645" offset="4523936">The hypothetical in particular is one of 16, possibly 17, of say 18 or 19 outlets where they are sold at sales deemed to be a liquidation sale, because they are virtually all of the assets, not within the ordinary course of business, but providing the debtor with a sufficient amount of cash to successfully reorganize and come out of Chapter 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.583" offset="4631769">You've now come full circle, for the debtor obviously falls directly within the language of Section 960 but yet has been held to be immune from taxation because it's liquidating as opposed to operating a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.072" offset="4689656">Two cited cases, cited by both of us for contrary rules, also demonstrate the perniciousness of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.158" offset="4729990">In Glick v. Missouri you have a bankruptcy trustee who is held liable for unemployment taxes by reason of Section 960, or actually who was allowed to... who was stated to be subject, 960 notwithstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.277" offset="4790489">Under Goggin this is arguably an Incorrect statement of the law, but it's an... an absurd application, because there is absolutely no reason advanced why a... a liquidation trustee should be exempt from paying unemployment taxes on the debtor's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.770" offset="4856527">There is absolutely no reason to deny those employees unemployment insurance benefits because they were operating under a liquidating trustee rather than an operating trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.237" offset="4894352">Similarly, in Cusado the Eleventh Circuit's wholesaler liquor case, liquor taxes were imposed at the wholesale level on the debtor and because of this, under the Goggin analysis, were held to be improperly applied and barred, yet there's no practical purpose inuring to the benefit of the bankruptcy estate from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.893" offset="4984945">Under Goggin, the only... under this analysis, only the estate is benefited by receiving more dollars by avoiding taxes that a regular business would otherwise have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.731" offset="5032278">This is done so that a retailer receives a better price from the estate and arguably makes a better profit at the retail level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.748" offset="5064357">But they are not going to provide the services and protection, that the state has to provide those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.901" offset="5085046">The ultimate effect... the ultimate effect of the entire analysis is that, essentially, an unevil... an uneven playing field, the uneven playing field decried by Congress has been created and you have liquor entering the commercial transactions of the State of Florida, which surfers absolutely no tax burden whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.696" offset="5172190">All of these results are produced by, in essence, resurrecting... quibbling over much the same terms of art that Section 960 was designed to obviate by essentially reading them back into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.304" offset="5222659">All of this creates a rule whereby tax-advantaged goods are created where to do so directly violates the concept of a level playing field, the concept underlying the promulgation of Section 960 in the first place and all without advancing any discernible Federal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.476" offset="5295279">The last point underscores the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.288" offset="5310535">It in fact there is no preemption under 960, the only bar is intergovernmental immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.012" offset="5329447">Yet whatever, these concepts mean, they are clearly not reached here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.194" offset="5346166">At issue in this case is a nondiscriminatory tax, broadly based, applicable to all retail sales in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.189" offset="5374169">It neither falls on a Federal Instrumentality nor imposes a cognizable burden on the processes of the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.235" offset="5402381">One need only look at who is paying the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.478" offset="5415338">There are no Federal dollars involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.681" offset="5424115">The taxes come out of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.191" offset="5430176">The trustee doesn't even pay the taxes, he passes them through to the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.274" offset="5446476">Who is complaining in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.284" offset="5454522">Not the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.024" offset="5461523">We have private parties before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.887" offset="5468941">Private parties who, simply put, want a better deal than they can get in the normal course of commercial discourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.533" offset="5491511">Simply put, they want a bar to the efforts of the state to equalize the tax burdens on the property they own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.698" offset="5516171">They don't stand in the shoes of the government, to use the terms of this Court, and there's simply no Federal interest in barring the state's efforts to equalize that tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.244" offset="5558385">This Court has recently declared its solicitousness of the efforts of states to raise revenues in this manner in the United States v. Washington case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.869" offset="5592866">Conversely, there is absolutely no tax on a government instrumentality, in that a government instrumentality is not involved in a liquidation sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.295" offset="5630587">Goggin II speaks of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.147" offset="5641976">Under United States v. New Mexico, the test is whether or not a trustee is incorporated into the government structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.190" offset="5670189">The trustee is paid by the estate, not by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.264" offset="5686489">The trustee is a private individual, operating his own business interests rather than being an employee of the Federal Government and he's acting to advance the private purposes of the creditors of the estate, rather than those of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.764" offset="5732465">Goggin II speaks of the liquidation sale as the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.015" offset="5749496">Yet, since the promulgation of the Code, Section 363 in specific, the sale is... the sale is by the trustee, not the court and obviously one can speak of Levy and those... those cases as holding that there is a Federal instrumentality involved, but since the promulgation of the Code that analysis is no longer correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.561" offset="5839671">There are two purposes of bankruptcy, only one of which is arguably affected by the instant taxation efforts and that is the efficient administration and distribution of the bankrupt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.728" offset="5884288">Yet the efficiency of the administration and distribution is not what's impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.842" offset="5900798">The impairment raised by Respondents rises solely from the equalization of the tax burden to support the services and protection that that property receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.977" offset="5933294">That equalization effort is felt to be a permissible abridgment on the exercise of enumerated powers as held... as stated, generally, in Massachusetts v. United States and Swarts v. Hammer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.937" offset="8093098">This case is different for two reasons, in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.272" offset="8110443">One reason is that I think this judge took a view of his own order that simply isn't supported by the literal language of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.789" offset="8140536">The second reason is that if you look at the findings and the opinion that the judge issued in that case, the order was clearly intended to proscribe whatever Goggin II proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.986" offset="8193304">So it basically incorporated by reference a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case, and the Petitioner has admitted that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2438.736" offset="9892308">We have never taken the position, as far as I can recall, that 28 U.S.C. Section 960 in and of itself directly limits states from imposing this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.288" offset="9958554">Our position is that it impliedly creates such a limitation, and we are well aware that as a rule of construction this Court disfavors implied preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.456" offset="10007247">But the argument that we're making in this case is not substantially different from the line of reasoning that this Court used in the First Agricultural National Bank case in construing 12 U.S.C. Section 548.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.030" offset="10073493">In that case, looking at the legislative history, the Court determined that Congress must have intended that this Section pro... prescribe those areas in which taxation was permitted to the exclusion of taxation in other areas, and the Court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.370" offset="10142874">I do want to point out, Swarts v. Hammer was decided 30 years before Section 960 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.395" offset="10179028">Presumably Congress was aware of Swarts v. Hammer at the time it enacted 960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.209" offset="10198254">The Swarts v. Hammer case doesn't deal with taxes of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.552" offset="10215599">What Swarts v. Hammer says is that there's no magic that occurs to property of the estate when a bankruptcy is filed such, that that property changes its nature so that the property shouldn't any longer be subject to property taxation, and we don't deny that property in bankruptcy estates is subject to ad valorem taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.566" offset="10303684">We have no issue with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.478" offset="10315283">Section 960 when it was enacted was enacted at a time when intergovernmental immunity was at its high water mark and basically there were decisions which tended to limit the ability of state governments to tax almost anything having to do with the Federal instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.912" offset="10397098">And the courts on some occasions had found bankruptcy estates, or Federal receivers, to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.937" offset="10433147">If the Supreme Court... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.629" offset="10451955">If Congress hadn't felt that taxation was generally proscribed, it wouldn't have enacted 960 because it's superfluous otherwise, and I can see a reasonable and logical argument that 960 is over 50 years old and it's basically now a historic anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.795" offset="10540563">The problem with that argument is that Congress undertook an exhaustive review of bankruptcy law in 1978 and at that time it reviewed, among other things, the provisions of the chapter in which Section 960 is and Congress in fact made some conforming changes to Section 959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.399" offset="10626976">If Congress had felt that Section 960 were no longer necessary or that it required some change to conform with the present status of the law, Congress could easily have made those changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.048" offset="11225598">--Yes, Your Honor and we... if they impose a tax generally that said, if you rent skis you have to pay a tax, we'd pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.352" offset="11254855">The only reason we owe this tax is because no sales tax was paid, so it's still a tax on the liquidation sale itself and in operation the way this tax works, it's basically designed to terrorize you into paying the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.974" offset="11325281">Because if you don't pay the sales tax you pay a tax measured by the same percentage of your rental income and as a general proposition, if you don't think you're going to generate at least as much rental income as you paid for the property, you wouldn't buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.532" offset="11383482">So as a general proposition you would ordinarily expect to, you know, wind up paying a higher use tax than the sales tax would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.229" offset="11422352">So basically what this is, Your Honor, is it's an effort on the part of the state to go far enough down the stream that they think they can safely do it, but still tax a transaction that is a Federal transaction and is not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.382" offset="11494972">It's an effort on their part--</text>

            <text syncTime="2852.634" offset="11547949">--I'm aware of those holdings and I disagree with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.903" offset="11561010">It's not unusual for there to be different constructions of different words in different parts of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.000" offset="11601447">For example, the term willful, as used in the Internal Revenue Code dealing with the 100 percent penalty for failure to withhold and turn over, at least as construed in the Ninth Circuit, it means that you were alive at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.029" offset="11649513">Willful in the context of the Bankruptcy Code means something much more limited than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.843" offset="11672814">I think that you don't have to apply doing business from the IRC to the bankruptcy context and I think in the bankruptcy context you have a long line of established case authority dealing with what is doing business and what isn't; and you're certainly going to have factual questions, but I don't think that the fact that a court is going to have to determine some factual issues justifies coming up with a rule that goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.134" offset="11801963">The concept that I would like to discuss with you for why this tax isn't allowable is one that I think the Court... and now I'm talking about the specific tax on my client... is a concept that the court has alluded to in the United States v. New Mexico case and also in the Red Cross case dealing with employment taxes, and the concept is this:</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.775" offset="11932471">There are some transactions irrespective of who the incidence of the tax falls on, there are some transactions which are Federal transactions and the states are not entitled to exercise control or authority over them, and they can't do that by simply choosing to place the incidence of the tax on somebody other than the Federal entity itself, and that's exactly what you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.755" offset="12044380">No matter how far downstream you go, as long as they're still collecting a tax that's only due because no sales tax was paid, it's still basically a tax on the sale itself and that transaction is a Federal transaction conducted by a Federal bankruptcy estate, conducted with the requirement that it be approved by the Federal Bankruptcy Court and it's subject to a whole system of Federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.923" offset="12149078">The states have no business asserting control over that transaction and to allow them to is to basically concede to them control over the bankruptcy process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3028.048" offset="12249598">You know, the idea that the power to tax is the power to destroy is no longer accepted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.842" offset="12268719">It's treated on a more pragmatic basis, don't you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_ray_jenkins" startTime="3036.316" stopTime="3228.163">
            <label>Mr. David Ray Jenkins</label>
            <text syncTime="3036.316" offset="12282616">I agree with that, but I think even under the more pragmatic basis that the Court now uses, that this transaction should not be taxable and it's part of the bankruptcy process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.477" offset="12339354">The states have no more business asserting control over the bankruptcy liquidation process than they do asserting control over national banks, and that's exactly what they're trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.247" offset="12398391">Now, I do want to discuss with you the case of Washington v. The United States, because it appears to be contrary to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.879" offset="12424932">In that case, there was a sales tax system where ordinarily in a contractor setting if I'm a contractor and I'm building a house for you and I go down to the hardware store, the incidence of the sales tax... the liability for the sales tax in the State of Washington is placed on you as the owner of the property that I'm going to improve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.357" offset="12518868">But the statute provides for a specific exception which says, if the owner of the property is a Federal entity then the tax falls on the contractor and in response to the argument that that was just an evasion of intergovernmental immunity, this Court said, look, the transaction is taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.648" offset="12595981">The fact that by an accident of state law the incidence of that tax would ordinarily fall on an exempt entity does not prevent the state from shifting the incidence of the tax to somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.977" offset="12645301">But the key in that case is that the transaction was itself taxable, and the transaction was me, a contractor, not a Federal entity, going down to the hardware store, which is also not a Federal entity and buying stuff to use to improve your home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.835" offset="12708726">That's a taxable transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.597" offset="12719802">The difference in the bankruptcy case is that it's a Federal transaction governed by Federal law and the state has no right to attempt to control it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.785" offset="12760553">You also need to look at the impact that your ruling is going to have on the Bankruptcy Code as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.612" offset="12803812">For example, if you hold that states can tax the liquidation process because what happens in the reorganization chapters is measured by what would happen in a liquidation, if I were to have to pay a 6.5 percent sales tax if I liquidated, that's 6.5 percent of the estate that I get to pocket as the debtor, because it's something that wouldn't have to go to the creditors and in Chapter 11, the floor on what you have to pay the creditors is what they would get in a reorganization and there are similar provisions in both Chapters 12 and 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.427" offset="12951142">That... the net result of that would be that if you find that states can tax bankruptcy liquidation sales you're going to be allowing debtors to achieve a great windfall and I don't think that Congress had that in mind at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.425" offset="13007149">Unless there are further questions, I will remit the rest of my time.</text>
