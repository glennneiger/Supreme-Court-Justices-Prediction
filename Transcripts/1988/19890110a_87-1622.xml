            <text syncTime="75.064" offset="443931">Yakima County is the second largest county in the State of Washington.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey C. Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="83.070" offset="476010">--Geographically.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.870" offset="479144">There's approximately 180,000 people in Yakima County.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.106" offset="492101">25,000 reside on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.891" offset="503281">5,000 of those are Indians and 20,000 are non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.260" offset="520731">The reservation itself consists of approximately 1.3 million acres, 80 percent of which is owned in trust, 20 percent is owned by non-Indians in fee simple, or approximately 260,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.769" offset="574752">There are 10,467 separate parcels of deeded land on the reservation, 500 miles of roads; county roads, there's a state highway and a lot of BIA roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.029" offset="627833">The issue in this case is the scope of regulatory control, civil regulatory control, that a tribe can exercise over non-members on deeded land.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.235" offset="672659">At the heart of this case is the tension that's created by two sets of promises made by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.639" offset="698259">On the one hand, you have the promise that Congress made to the Indians through the treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.276" offset="716754">On the other hand, you have the promise that Congress made to the citizens whom they invited onto those lands through the General Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.381" offset="753221">We believe this case involves the application of this Court's ruling in Montana versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.952" offset="779448">In Montana, the Court was called upon to determine the extent of power that the tribe still retained in the area of civil regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.510" offset="817691">In that case we were dealing with the hunting and fishing rights of those non-members on deeded land.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.497" offset="841619">This Court, in examining the prior opinions of the Court, including Wheeler and Oliphant, determined first that the exclusive use and benefit language of the Crow treaty did not give them the right to control those non-members.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.773" offset="902746">They did not have the inherent right, nor did they have the treaty right.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.493" offset="925629">The Court recognized that, Oliphant, the intent of Congress, that the inherent right had been removed, particularly with respect to the non-Indian... removed from the tribe, this inherent power with respect to non-Indians on their own land.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.253" offset="988741">We submit that Montana actually, however, did establish a bright line test, the bright line test that we are asking this Court to impose.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey C. Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="223.578" offset="1037956">--Well, because the Ninth Circuit, we submit, did not read it correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.083" offset="1068049">And in fact, the court misperceived it dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.285" offset="1084872">The court said, meaning the Ninth Circuit, that in fact the treaty provided those rights and that the tribe had inherent rights, and then went on to rule that... adopt a per se rule of jurisdiction for tribes based upon its reading of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.782" offset="1166792">The court said... I mean, the Montana language is:</text>
            <text syncTime="258.568" offset="1177972">"Though Oliphant only determined the inherent tribal authority in criminal matters, the principles on which it relied support the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of non-members of the tribe.

            <text syncTime="275.795" offset="1246831">"To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations. "</text>

            <text syncTime="296.859" offset="1331154">We have no objection to that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.299" offset="1368875">The Court, in establishing the second exception, did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.833" offset="1379010">One, it says "a tribe may also retain", which is a question as to whether in fact they retain any inherent power at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.443" offset="1633443">We submit that if the Ninth Circuit's opinion is allowed to stand, any properly drawn ordinance passed by an Indian nation would in fact confer civil regulatory control.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.993" offset="5851696">The fact is that, unlike a sales tax, which is collected at one point, zoning by its nature, that the decisions are made on the basis of the entire surrounding area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.753" offset="5902687">So it just seems wierd to say that the county has jurisdiction to zone one little parcel that's in the middle, totally surrounded by Indian-owned land or trust lands, and say that it's the county that should have the right to determine whether doing something on that isolated parcel is going to affect the surrounding land.</text>

            <text syncTime="2235.350" offset="9085028">In 1905 this Court held in the Winans case that the Yakima treaty was a true treaty of what we call cession, all rights reserved that weren't ceded to the government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.876" offset="9143229">That is important because when you look at the provisions of the Yakima treaty, specifically article 1, the Yakima Nation ceded to the United States government in 1855 the lands to which it claimed and occupied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.362" offset="9877165">I think also it's hard to deny that Congress intended that some or a good portion of those lands would pass out of Indian ownership.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.943" offset="9959503">The Court's dealt with that situation in its recent decision in Solem versus Barnett, in which it held that Acts of that type shouldn't be construed as a divestment of tribal sovereignty or tribal boundaries and government over lands of that type unless there is clear evidence of specific intent, unambiguous intent of Congress that such a divestiture was intended.</text>

I'm not sure whether you can call it Congressional intent... that speaks of the background of the 1905 Surplus Lands Act at Yakima, that says these Indians haven't consented, these Indians are causing us problems, we need to open these lands to non-Indian settlers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.785" offset="10326785">If you look at, for instance, the Surplus Lands Act, it doesn't say anything in that Act that we are divesting the Indians of any jurisdiction over these lands within their boundaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.420" offset="13317388">Now, the people situation is in fact in the area where the tribe is governing, it's not 25,000/5, 000, as Mr. Sullivan stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.395" offset="13361273">10,000 of those people live... excuse we, 20,000 and 5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.649" offset="13390321">Instead, in the open area it's 10,000 people outside the towns and 5,000 Indians, if that in effect somehow tips the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.572" offset="13425952">I don't believe it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.106" offset="13432117">But there is not the inequities that they point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.558" offset="13441939">The tribe has a real and legitimate interest in protect ion of this area.</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_c_sullivan" startTime="3338.366" stopTime="3554.207">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey C. Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="3338.366" offset="13497110">Mr. Chief Justice:</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.985" offset="13503588">I think one of Mr. Weaver's analogies just towards the end here points out part of the problem, why we believe that there are constitutional issues here in terms of taking and how the tribe is protected and individual citizens are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.226" offset="13556565">The Mayor of the City of Toppenish is a Yakima Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.661" offset="13566282">She participates fully, as do the tribal members, in the government of the cities, the counties, and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.982" offset="13591569">Mr. Brendale and Mr. Wilkinson, as was pointed out, cannot vote, do not participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.920" offset="13619363">The General Allotment Acts in our view eliminated the exclusive use language upon which Mr. Weaver attempts to rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.126" offset="13664189">Footnote 9 in the Montana decision goes through this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.562" offset="13673907">The tribes... and both Oliphant and in Montana attempted to use the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.466" offset="13697521">We believe that the language difference... and I think there is a couple of words difference between the Crow treaty and the Yakima treaty... is a distinction without a difference, and that this Court's rulings previously in this matter should in fact, should follow that language and should rule that Montana does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.212" offset="13776516">But I think the question Justice Stevens had, is it the only case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.514" offset="13789786">I think it's the only case in the serse that it follows the law up to that point as it's developed in the whole area of the Indian law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.103" offset="13824059">We're confronted with this question of civil regulatory control, and what we are suggesting is a rule based on Montana that puts us on an equal basis with the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.059" offset="13863869">We start out with the basis with all Indians that they control the deeded lands... excuse me, the trust land... no matter where it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.280" offset="13888842">They acknowledge their position is, if there was one lot of trust land in the middle of the city of Toppenish, they should exercise control over it and in fact do exercise control over it for all purposes, including taxation and zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.539" offset="13937848">There's a Code of Federal Regulations that says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.408" offset="13949342">What the county is saying... and then there are some exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.858" offset="13959164">This Court in Colville gave a very narrow exception and said, tribes, that's true, you can control your trust land, but within a very narrow exception, when the state government's interest is being affected by what you are doing, in fact the state can have some control over trust land, i.e., you're going to be required to collect taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.072" offset="14039934">All we're asking for is an equal right, that you approach even a Brendale situation as to start with the county having jurisdiction and then we're saying the carefully circumscribed exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.296" offset="14088836">Because of the constitutional limitations, we believe that exception can't be given the broad analysis that the tribes are in fact encouraging, but in fact should be extremely narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.520" offset="14129796">And what this Court should say to the tribe is: If the state action will affect their ability to govern themselves and their members... that's what their inherent sovereignty, that's what's left of their inherent sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.995" offset="14183712">It's just Judge Quackenbush said, the problem is the Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.065" offset="14199908">But we have to deal with history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.082" offset="14208059">We can't just overlook history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.434" offset="14217463">We've got to recognize that, because of an Act of Congress, we have non-Indians, American citizens, who are on this property, who have rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.306" offset="14252885">And in order to balance those rights, we are suggesting that the exception needs to be very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.543" offset="14273887">Look at the cases that were cited in support of the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.078" offset="14287993">Fisher involved all Indians and adoptions, and in fact has been basically, the need for Fisher, eliminated by the Indian Chlid Welfare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.434" offset="14321430">The other cases that were cited in support of that second exception I believe give weight to our argument that it was intended to be strict, very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.607" offset="14358106">Thank you very much.</text>
