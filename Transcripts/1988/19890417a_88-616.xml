            <text syncTime="15.511" offset="208699">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.864" offset="218104">The question presented in this case is whether a Social Security claimant has a right under the Equal Access to Justice Act to recover from the United States the attorney's fees and expenses she incurred in administrative proceedings following a remand from a federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.806" offset="289888">Before summarizing the facts in this case, I will briefly describe the two provisions of each of the Equal Access to Justice Act that have been discussed in connection with the fee award in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.463" offset="336490">EAJA waives the sovereign immunity of the United States to fees and expenses in certain circumstances specified in the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.929" offset="370450">EAJA contains two basic provisions, one applicable to administrative proceedings, the other to judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.363" offset="396154">The provision of EAJA applicable to administrative proceedings is contained in Section 504 of Title 5 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.738" offset="429591">It provides that an agency that conducts what the Act refers to as an adversary adjudication shall award to the prevailing party in such an adjudication the fees and expenses that were incurred unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or special circumstances would make an award unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.595" offset="521019">The term adversary adjudication is precisely defined in EAJA to mean circumstances in which the position of the government is represented by counsel or otherwise in the adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.095" offset="567099">The other provision of EAJA concerning the award of attorney's fees and expenses in court is contained in Section 2412(d) of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.409" offset="608373">It authorizes a court to award a prevailing party fees and expenses incurred by that party</text>
            <text syncTime="122.395" offset="636272">"in any civil action, including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of the action. "</text>
            <text syncTime="132.490" offset="676605">It is the position of the United States in this case that neither of these provisions of EAJA waives the sovereign immunity of the United States to the award of fees and expenses on remand in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.970" offset="722580">Section 504 is inapplicable because administrative proceedings under the Social Security Act are non-adversarial.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.153" offset="747344">The government does not take a position in those hearings and is not represented by counsel or otherwise in them.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.530" offset="784856">Well, the model rules promulgated by the Administrative Conference of the United States and followed by federal agencies, including HHS, have given content to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.316" offset="819965">Those model rules defined "represented by counsel or otherwise" to refer to situations in which there is another sort of representative, such as a paralegal, who might represent the government in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.947" offset="874508">The model rules define the phrase "represented by counsel or otherwise" to refer to situations in which the position of the United States is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and then actually participates in the administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.268" offset="939710">The Administrative Conference was given authority to coordinate the implementation of EAJA in the administrative context under Section 504(c)(1) of the Act, and these model rules were in effect... were promulgated in 1981 and have been in effect ever since, and were in effect when Congress reenacted EAJA in 1985.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.697" offset="2237473">The Social Security Act itself divides the responsibilities in a directly parallel fashion between the Agency and the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.063" offset="2270910">Under Title II, for example, Section 405(b) specifically directs the Secretary to conduct hearings and to find facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.137" offset="2303197">Section 405(b) applies both in the initial hearings and on any hearings on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.621" offset="2325140">The same standards, the same procedures apply, and they are non-adversarial in the same way as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.957" offset="2346561">Section 405(g), on the other hand, is the provision of the Social Security Act that deals with judicial review, and it deals with the responsibilities of the court, not the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.734" offset="2385640">In fact, 405(g) uses the same phrase, civil action, that EAJA does.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.038" offset="2406851">So, the attorney's fees that are authorized under Section 2412 under EAJA in a civil action are only those fees incurred in the action for a judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.212" offset="3335557">The Appeals Council ordered the ALJ to review Respondent's case under the new standards and suggested that the ALJ receive the advise of a medical advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.379" offset="3376203">All of those are clearly non-adversarial undertakings by the government, and in fact were for the benefit of the claimant.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.290" offset="3427821">So, it seems to us to be particularly vivid in this case that the proceedings were non-adversarial.</text>

            <text syncTime="842.295" offset="3515906">But it was perfectly evident from the prior portions of the ALJ's decision that that was an error, and there is no reason to think that the Appeals Council would have overlooked that onset date on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.421" offset="3552373">But, more importantly, that error was not in any way due to adversarial representation by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.306" offset="3579958">Once again, whatever one might think should be the proper rule here, Congress has specified that before an agency, fees may be awarded only when the agency proceedings themselves satisfy the statutory definition of being an adversary adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.500" offset="8052644">Since the case was not over until the remanded proceedings were completed, everything that occurred had to be part of the judicial proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2277.270" offset="9255739">Section 504 of Title 5... I think by its terms it's clear that it was intended to deal with administrative proceedings that occurred prior to judicial review and that were concluded prior to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.567" offset="9344974">There are three provisions of Section 504, I think, that are relevant in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.930" offset="9374440">First, the party must prevail in the adversary adjudication, and that's Section 504(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.807" offset="9409862">Second, the fee sought must be sought within 30 days of a final disposition in the adversary adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.194" offset="9443508">Then, finally, Section 504(c) provides that if there is judicial review sought of the final decision following the adversary adjudication, then fees can be awarded only by the court that reviews the final action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.696" offset="9517486">That is Section 504(c), and fees in that case would be awarded under Section 2412(d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.272" offset="9555730">There is no other circumstance, even in Section 504, where the Agency makes a final decision, a final determination, and then that is reviewed by a court in which you go back to the Agency to recover fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.794" offset="9621872">The notion is that the action is terminated on judicial review for purposes of the administrative proceeding as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.559" offset="9648935">In this... In this case, the government for the first time in its reply brief takes the position that the... that the judicial proceeding terminated with the remand order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.949" offset="9710479">That is contrary to the position that it took earlier in the case and is contrary to the position that it has taken in all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.516" offset="9748722">And, it's contrary to the house report that specifically referred to cases decided in the Fourth Circuit and the Third Circuit dealing with this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.374" offset="9796161">The remand proceedings... first of all, in order to recover attorney fees the party must prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.411" offset="9828344">In other words, in a Social Security case, the party must obtain benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.296" offset="9847883">That happens only after the remand proceedings have been concluded and the findings of the Secretary and a decision is filed back with the court which has jurisdiction under Section 405(g) to enter the final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.555" offset="9912876">In addition, the 30-day time period for filing the application begins to run from the time of a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.431" offset="9948402">And the cases have consistently interpreted that requirement to mean the time that the district court enters an order terminating the proceeding, the judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.109" offset="9995109">In the section of the legislative history cited by the government at page 26 of its brief that talks about remand proceedings, first of all, it's important to note that that section of the legislative history dealt only with whether or not fees would be available at the point that a remand order is obtained, as opposed to whether they are available as cases have held following the receipt of benefits on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.549" offset="10124886">But in that section of the legislative history, the House Report says that the remand decision is not a final judgment nor is the Agency decision after remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.969" offset="10174518">Instead, the district court should enter an order affirming, modifying, or reversing the final Agency decision, and this will usually be the final judgment that starts your 30 days for filing the EAJA petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.298" offset="10227913">That is the position that the government has taken throughout in this case until the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.873" offset="10254139">For the first time in the reply brief the government suggests that the final judgment in this case came at the time that a remand order issued, as opposed to the time, December 1, 1987, when the district court entered an order dismissing this case but retaining jurisdiction to entertain a petition for attorney fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.701" offset="13841483">What's encompassed in the term "civil action" is only the judicial review of the agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.296" offset="13867919">The agency action is something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.277" offset="13875756">And when a case gets remanded back to the Secretary, in this case the Secretary vacated the first administrative decision denying the claim, held further proceedings, and then entered a new decision on the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.636" offset="13921209">That new decision on remand was Agency action, taken by the Secretary pursuant to statutory authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.369" offset="13944197">I agree with all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.918" offset="13946391">But somebody who talks that way, when he says "prevailing party" probably means prevailing party in the separate civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.925" offset="13978365">I mean, you ask us to regard them as separate for one purpose and not to regard them as separate for another purpose.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3463.909" offset="14002293">Well, Congress, in our view, did precisely that because the administrative proceedings are separately dealt with in Section 504, and the word "prevailing" carries two meanings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.874" offset="14042208">Prevailing on the particular issue in court and on the overall claim for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.807" offset="14057881">And, as I said, it's a condition subsequent, that you not only have to prevail on the legal issue the first time around in court, but also have to prevail on the claim for benefits in the main to be entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.487" offset="14104588">Also, I'd like to point out that in Section 405(g), it does not require that the record get sent back to the court in all proceedings as if the Secretary were just a special master for the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.553" offset="14152863">The provision for certifying the record back to the court is only in a narrow sort of pre-judgment remand by the court where the case gets sent back to the Secretary to receive new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.220" offset="14191524">And, far from making the Secretary an agent of the court in those circumstances, that provision for sending it back to the Secretary demonstrates that the Secretary is a separate entity, not part of the court.</text>
