            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86743">The second case, United States Department of Justice against Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, is a case that comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.688" offset="141391">The respondents, a CBS news correspondent and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, seek disclosure of criminal history information about certain private individuals contained in FBI wrap sheets.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.745" offset="197711">Exemption 7(c) of the Freedom of Information Act exempts from disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent that the production of such materials could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.530" offset="276810">In an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the interest of a private citizen in non-disclosure of a wrap sheet is the sort of personal privacy interest that congress intended exemption 7(c) to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.957" offset="334488">We further hold that such an invasion of privacy is not warranted under the Act when the request seeks no official information about a government agency that merely records that the government happens to be storing.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.129" offset="387256">The judgment below is accordingly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.505" offset="400735">Justice Blakcmun has filed an opinion concurring the judgment in which Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
