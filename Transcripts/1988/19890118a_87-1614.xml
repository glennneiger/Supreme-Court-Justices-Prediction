            <text syncTime="16.360" offset="213528">Petitioners divide their argument this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.645" offset="226693">I will address the facts and circumstances why respondents, in fairness and equity, are precluded from relitigating the validity of consent decrees providing race conscious relief entered after seven years of contested litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.339" offset="293462">Respondents are precluded for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.125" offset="308613">First, they knowingly sat on the by... sidelines of this litigation for seven years without either intervening or otherwise claiming an interest in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.683" offset="354798">Thereafter, they were afforded an opportunity at a fairness hearing to contest the issue of race conscious relief, and they had a full and fair opportunity to do so on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.977" offset="419999">We argue for the following rule in the nature of collateral estoppel where the lawfulness of remedial race relief has been determined, where non-minority employees have had a meaningful opportunity to participate in that determination, then they cannot thereafter repeatedly relitigate that issue in separate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.760" offset="515085">We believe that the rule we propose adequately accommodates the interest of non-parties; conserves judicial resources; and certainly, in Title VII litigation, provides an opportunity for the prompt settlement that Congress has mandated where possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.737" offset="591049">No better illustration of the difficulties of a contrary role exists than this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.660" offset="622710">In accepting the invitation of the United States to settle this case in 1981, the city of Birmingham, Alabama, agreed to comprehensive consent decrees to conclude seven years of litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.378" offset="841616">Thereafter, we were aware, of course, that the same individuals who subsequently did try to intervene unsuccessfully at a later point were interested in the litigation from the outset, participated certainly by consulting with our co-defendant, the personnel board, through a period of two trials, one in 1976, one in 1979, without ever intervening.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.705" offset="3774853">I would like to make three points today.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.090" offset="3784466">First, due process does not require allowing respondents a separate proceeding to attack the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.311" offset="3809335">Second, the Wilks Respondents should have intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.930" offset="3823755">Joinder is not required for finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.515" offset="3834099">And third, they did in fact have their collateral attack below.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.584" offset="3850399">This Court has held in a series of cases from Weber to Johnson that, in appropriate situations, affirmative action is lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.440" offset="3881851">The issue today is when those determinations are final.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.392" offset="3897629">We argued for a rule that allows for closure once there has been judicial determination and a meaningful opportunity to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.680" offset="3934827">Under Respondent's rule, that would not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.865" offset="3943500">For example, in the two years prior to July of 1987, there were 654 consent decrees entered in employment civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.721" offset="3978922">That doesn't count litigated decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.173" offset="3988744">Everyone, or virtually every one of those decrees would be subject to attack by white employees who were not joined in those cases, let alone the hundreds of cases that occurred before then.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.375" offset="6469541">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.713" offset="6482915">The issue before the Court today is whether a district court should hear the Title VII and equal protection claims of Plaintiffs who were denied promotions on the basis of their race when their employer simply alleges that the challenged actions were taken pursuant to a court-approved consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.525" offset="6554177">We believe it is improper to allow an employer to bargain away the Title VII and constitutional rights of non-parties and bind them to their settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.179" offset="6588764">This is especially true in the context of this case, where intervention was sought before entry of the consent decree and denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.850" offset="6623454">Through their joint invocation of the timeliness provisions of Rule 24, as well as the so-called no-collateral attack doctrine, the Petitioners have effectively insulated their decrees and their conduct from the scrutiny of adversarial litigation brought by the people who have in fact been denied promotions, and thereby denied the Respondents a day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.550" offset="6714256">I want to address, if I may, Justice O'Connor's question right up front, with respect to whether or not we had that collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.656" offset="6746648">When the district court heard the motions to dismiss on May 14, 1984, it set out the issues, and that is cited in our brief and is in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.463" offset="6789906">But it, at that time, at the motion to dismiss stage, adopted the no-collateral attack position and held that the only way that we could prevail would be to prove that the city was not in fact following the consent decree, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph two of the decree, which we believe provides a caveat to the terms of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.127" offset="6872558">Again, in its February 1985 interim order on motions for partial summary judgment, the court again repeated that its earlier discussions with counsel on what it believed the trial issues were, and the fact that we could not collaterally attack... the word "collateral" isn't even appropriate, because we were not parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.421" offset="6953746">We could not attack actions taken pursuant to the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.242" offset="6973077">The court carefully limited all of the pre-trial preparation, culled our witness list, and directed the preparation for trial, and the Eleventh Circuit recognized all of this and noted it in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.883" offset="7023546">And in its final order, which was drafted by the Petitioners, the court made passing references to its prior positions that the decree is lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.708" offset="7066909">At any rate, we believe that the Respondents should not be bound by the decrees which were entered in this case, because they were not parties nor privies to parties to the decree parties, both--</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.279" offset="12233198">Even if the consent decree contains that type of relief, it's not particularly clear whether any of the Respondents will seek promotions or be eligible for promotions, and it's not clear if they seek promotions whether they'll be promoted or not be promoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.671" offset="12282726">And finally, even if they're not promoted, it's not clear that they would feel sufficiently aggrieved by that decision to want to file a lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.470" offset="12685952">The fundamental point here, and I think it's one that the Petitioners have consistently glossed over, is that given the strong background of due process that suggests that a party cannot be bound to a case in which they're not a party... a person can't be bound in a case when they're not a party, not privy... one would expect if there was to be an exception to that that you would find it in a statute of Congress or in one of the federal rules of civil procedure, and provisions, for example, regarding notice--</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.660" offset="13142677">First of all, this Court has held in Mullane and related cases not that subjective knowledge is required but that reasonable means must be undertaken in order to assure actual knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.200" offset="13184891">And no claim can be made that reasonable means in the Mullane sense were undertaken here in order to provide notice to these particular Respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.114" offset="13276528">Furthermore, one would think that under the intervene or be bound rule that the relevant thing that the Respondents would have to have notice of was the fact that if they don't intervene they will... excuse me, be subject to their collateral estoppel... would be subject to a collateral estoppel contention or that they will be unable to attack the terms of the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.659" offset="13346746">And there was never any suggestion that that type of notice was provided to the individual Respondents in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.531" offset="13382168">I think it's... one instructive way to think about this proposed rule, this collateral attack rule, is to compare it to the class action procedures of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.906" offset="13419679">Petitioners' argument would in effect transform a class action, Title VII class action, into a double class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.393" offset="13445593">Not only would you have the named and defined class that receives all the procedural protections of Rule 23, but in addition you would have an undefined class with no representative party representing that class, no inquiry into the adequacy of representation, and none of the other protections of notice by Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.937" offset="13519781">And that class would nevertheless also be subject... or would be unable in the future, to collaterally attack certain provisions of the case that were entered into.</text>
