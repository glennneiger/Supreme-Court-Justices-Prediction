            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86565">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Frank versus Minnesota Newspaper Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.836" offset="109866">The Minnesota Newspaper Association sued in Federal Court in Minnesota to prevent the Postmaster General from enforcing a federal statute which prohibited the mailing of any publication containing advertisements for lotteries or list of lottery prizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.517" offset="172560">The District Court granted partial relief and both parties appealed to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.063" offset="190741">After we had noted jurisdiction over the appeals, Congress passed further legislation affecting the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.880" offset="214043">The parties agreed between themselves to dismiss the Newspaper Associationâ€™s appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.643" offset="233060">And now, the Newspaper Association states its willingness to forego all relief that it sought by filing this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.209" offset="259391">In a Per Curiam opinion filed with the Clerk, we conclude that this stipulation renders the case moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.552" offset="280707">We therefore vacate the judgment below and remand for the District Court to dismiss the portions of the complaint remaining at issue on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.879" offset="310069">Justices White and Marshall dissent and Justice Stevens has filed a separate dissent.</text>
