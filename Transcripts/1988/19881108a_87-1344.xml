            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136221">We'll hear argument now in No. 87-1344, Richard A. Thornburgh v. Jack Abbott.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.628" offset="170703">Mr. Bryson, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="10.989" stopTime="163.798">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="10.989" offset="180107">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.921" offset="191810">The issue in this case is what standard should be applied by courts in confronting the censorship of publications sent into federal prisons for inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.748" offset="239143">The question is whether the reasonableness standard should be used, which is the standard that this Court has articulated on a number of occasions with respect to prisoners' rights in cases during the last 15 years, or the heightened scrutiny standard of the decision in Procunler against Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.680" offset="314899">The reasonableness standard is perhaps best articulated as a standard in which the action of the prison officials is to be upheld if it is reasonably related to a valid penological concern, as long as there is not substantial evidence that the reaction, the action, the regulation or whatnot, is an exaggerated response by the prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.590" offset="430569">The heightened scrutiny standard from Procunler is that the regulation must actually further an important governmental interest and go no farther than is necessary or essential to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.139" offset="492740">Now, the regulations in this case that are at issue are regulations which were first promulgated in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.347" offset="525550">They have precursors that go back many years, but the particular regulations that are at issue are the 1979 regulations as modified by 1980 and 1985 policy statements of the Bureau of Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.046" offset="592319">This adds some complication to the case because most of the publications that are at issue in the case that the Plaintiffs protest their exclusion were excluded in 1977 and 1978, before the actual promulgation of the new policy and before the promulgation of the policy statement that deals with sexually oriented publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.941" offset="683957">But the basic gist of the regulation is pretty much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.655" offset="706840">It has been changed in some particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.064" offset="716453">It has been made tighter as far as procedural protections go.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.758" offset="739232">But the basic components of the policy are still the same as they were in 1977 and, indeed, back in 1973 when this case was first filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.907" offset="787819">And the--</text>

            <text syncTime="163.798" offset="791372">Is there any doubt about this being still a live controversy?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="167.532" stopTime="218.773">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="167.532" offset="806314">--Well, Your Honor, it's not a... there's no doubt about its being a live controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.903" offset="819793">What may not be live in this regard are... and the Court of Appeals acknowledged this... are the challenges to the rejection of these 46 publications that are at issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.691" offset="866918">These 46 publications all are publications that were rejected in 1977 and 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.134" offset="892727">These publications, there was testimony at trial to show, might very well have been admitted under the new policy, but in any event, the Court of Appeals sent this case back to the district court for an assessment, among other things, of whether there's any further controversy with respect to those publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.076" offset="960437">What isn't in doubt is that there's a continuing dispute about the validity of the standard that should be applied in this case; that is to say, whether Procunler, the standard or the reasonableness standard should apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.947" offset="1027937">Now, the point of the original plaintiffs go back to 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.800" offset="1043401">Some of these people are still incarcerated, and in any event, it's a class action and was certified at such at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.623" offset="1066703">Now, the regulation that's at issue in this case... and I'd like to spend a little more time on the facts perhaps than I normally would because they are somewhat intricate... but the regulation that's at issue says that a warden may reject a publication only if it is determined detrimental to the security, good order or discipline of the institution, or if it might facilitate criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.651" offset="1170774">The regulation then goes on to say that the warden may not reject a publication solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social or sexual.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.235" offset="1205152">The regulation then contains a series of examples of specific, dealing with specific areas, directing when the warden can exclude particular types of materials such as materials that are in code, materials that depict escape plans, materials that depict, encourage or describe methods of escape and may lead to the use of physical violence or group disruption.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="293.352" offset="1309537">--Mr. Bryson, what does the word "sexual" in the regulation really mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="299.497" offset="1334197">How far does it carry us, because some of those that were rejected are certainly sexually explicit magazines, are they not?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="307.361" stopTime="428.169">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="307.361" offset="1365648">Some of them certainly are sexually explicit magazines, and here, Your honor, is a perfect example of why I think the materials that are, the specific materials that are in dispute in this case would probably be handled quite differently from the way they were back in 1977 and 1978 when they were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.102" offset="1436597">The materials that are dealt with under the sexual... sexual materials provision of the regulation are sexually explicit materials, but the wardens are advised by the policy statement of 1980 that heterosexual materials normally will not be excluded, even if they are sexually explicit materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.376" offset="1517681">Now, there are exceptions to to this which include sadomasochistic materials, bestiality and child pornography, but by and large, heterosexual materials, even if sexually explicit, will be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.274" offset="1561253">And this is the program statement that is found in the appendix to the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.446" offset="1577971">Again, there were materials that were kept out in 1977 and '78 which the Plaintiffs protested, but those materials, at least with respect to sexually explicit heterosexual materials, probably would now come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.906" offset="1639829">The district court upheld the regulations facially and as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.462" offset="1673997">The court found after a ten-day trial in which evidence was taken from both the Plaintiffs' experts and from the defense experts, including a number of wardens and regional directors and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons... the district court found that violence in federal prisons is a major problem and that it is caused in major part by ethnic gangs and homosexual activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.099" offset="1772531">Many assaults, the district court found... and there are a lot of assaults in federal prison, both on other inmates and on prison guards... many of the assault... assaults are precipitated, the district court found, or manifested by homosexual activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.518" offset="2010245">So the core idea of the whole regulations was the same as it has been since 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.051" offset="2040339">But what was changed was these particular applications, these directions to the wardens was... Those were added in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.578" offset="2078477">In addition, the more liberal policy with respect to sexually explicit materials was instituted in 1980, and perhaps particularly important for the purpose of procedural objections that are raised here, a number of changes were made in the regulations to provide, for example, a more extensive review process for the inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.024" offset="2176280">The inmates, under new regulations, can see the materials prior to taking an appeal from the, from the rejection by the warden in most cases, and the... there is an effort made to attain more uniformity in the prison system by virtue of an appeal system which was much more rudimentary back in the '70s.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.398" offset="2265723">So there were procedural changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.170" offset="3604864">I think it's fair to say that it has initially intended, in all likelihood, as a least restrictive alternative type rule; that is to say, if there's some way that this particular regulation could be narrowed, then it constitutionally must be so narrowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.779" offset="3667245">That least restrictive alternative, as the Court noted in the Turner case, that approach to prison... the regulation of activities within a prison, tends to put the wardens in a position that they can be second-guessed by the court at every turn.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.338" offset="4333472">For example, the Court said with respect to the provision that states that materials that instruct in criminal activity will be excluded, the Court said that that wasn't sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.407" offset="4397837">The Court explained that there was no requirement, no requirement in the regulations that the warden find a probability that the publication will result in a breach of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.186" offset="4440887">Now, that's asking an awful lot, to say that instruct... materials that instruct in criminal activity cannot be excluded from a prison because there is no likelihood, no probability that the publication will result in a breach of security or order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.187" offset="4508910">Now, there are various other provisions in the... various other statements in the Court of Appeals' opinion in which essentially the same approach is taken, which is to say you have to establish a likelihood that something will actually happen as a result of the admission of these materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.608" offset="4586650">We think the district court got it right when the district court said at page 32A of the petition appendix, that wardens should not be required to show a likely, immediate or substantial threat of a breach of security or order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.609" offset="5122579">And those cases make quite clear that a prison is the ultimate non-public forums and the rule that applies in non-public forum cases is, again, the reasonableness test, essentially, exactly the test that the Court has adopted for the rights of prisoners themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.220" offset="5193005">And we are urging that that rule be applied to the rights of those who are seeking to send materials into the prison, a non-public forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.371" offset="5781700">Well, that really don't do as an answer because the place where the materials are circulated, the place where the materials are sent, is the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.866" offset="5815659">In Jones against North Carolina Prisoners' Union, the Court clearly said that the prisons were a non-public forum in response to an argument that the mails were being used to send in bulk materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.824" offset="5871457">So the mails as a forum is just another way of trying to say that the prison is in part a public forum, which it is decidedly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.201" offset="5900923">Second, they argue that these materials... these, these regulations are not content-neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.643" offset="5926732">Well, they are neutral with respect to the question of the opposition or... opposition to the speaker's viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.902" offset="5971767">Now, that is the way in which neutrality is central in the, in the non-public forum cases such as Perry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.585" offset="6298507">I'm here today representing the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.998" offset="6316165">This is a case involving the free speech rights of outsiders, and only incidentally a prisoner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.842" offset="6343542">I represent publishers whose publications and books were excluded from federal prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.046" offset="6368306">I'm going to make three basic points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.808" offset="6379382">First point is that using a reasonableness type test, the, the Bureau of Prisons has engaged in unjustified censorship of otherwise protected material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.917" offset="6435806">In other words, the standard that they are defending in this Court is essentially one of reasonableness compared to their correspondence policy, and it... it is the implementation of that policy that has led to unjustified censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.136" offset="6496724">My second point is that Martinez must control the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.091" offset="6520548">Both of those cases involved the content-based censorship of individually mailed written materials from outsiders, and to that extent, those two cases are synonymous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2642.124" offset="10704632">I think it's, it's important to recognize that the broad standard that the Bureau has adopted allowing this wide discretion really allows for the exercise of unprofessional judgments, personal judgments, personal distaste by the prison officials, and that's what the record in this case shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.468" offset="10794076">And we feel that's where the standard could make a difference, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.143" offset="10812779">I think it will give a signal that the same protection that is given to correspondence must be given to books and publications coming into prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.827" offset="10851441">We think that the standard adopted by the D.C. Circuit is a... is consistent with Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.784" offset="10891356">The, the Circuit Court said that the prison official would have to make a reasoned determination that material encourages conduct which would constitute or otherwise was likely to produce a breach of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.633" offset="10942660">That's not much different than the standard even used in the Jones case in this Court for non-prison related where the question was did it possess a likelihood of disruption to prison security, order or stability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.415" offset="11085811">Very briefly, there are some publications that we think would be disposed of differently under the two standards, at least, again, the standard that the Court of Appeals applied, purportedly applying the Procunier standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.775" offset="11139310">One of them the Court of Appeals made quite clear it would keep out was the The Call magazine, which the Plaintiffs nave made a great deal of in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.051" offset="11184345">This was a magazine In which... which was kept out of Marion Penitentiary because it was deemed to be too inflammatory, basically, and to be a magazine which would be likely to cause disruption within the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.291" offset="11241292">Marion, as you may know is the maximum, maximum security institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.726" offset="11263026">The people who are incarcerated in Marion are people who have failed to adjust to other institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.289" offset="11285282">It is an extremely dangerous place, and the prospects of difficulties in Marion [inaudible].</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2794.814" offset="11315375">Mr. Bryson, I suppose you would contend that Call ought to be kept out under... even under the Procunier standard?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2799.528" stopTime="2968.398">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="2799.528" offset="11334288">Your Honor, we would say that, we might well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.657" offset="11346827">But what, what we're looking at is the standard the Court of Appeals applied, purporting to apply Procunier, and the Court of Appeals said with respect to Call that it was insufficient to keep that magazine out simply because it was inflammatory in tone because it contained no exhortation for group activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.671" offset="11414850">And let me read you a selection from the article that was the result, that was the reason that Call was kept out, and I think this makes the case very well for why the exhortation only rule that the Court of Appeals applied just won't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.761" offset="11475245">The magazine said beatings by racist guards are a regular occurrence at Marion, but officials have not been able to crush prisoner resistance or halt the spread of revolutionary ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.886" offset="11515682">Besides the lawsuit, Marlon inmates have staged strikes and fasts and have continued to struggle against their oppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.881" offset="11543685">Well, that doesn't contain exhortation, technically, but any reader, particularly some of the readers who are perhaps a little more excitable than others and who are looking for opportunities to express grievances towards the prison officials, will read that, I submit, as a form of implicit exhortation, to continue to do these very things that are described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.312" offset="11617455">Similarly, the magazines such as homosexual explicit materials which the Court of Appeals said we could not keep out on the basis of the explanations that we gave, would be materials that we would want to keep out and would expect to keep out under a reasonableness test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.227" offset="11705122">With respect to The Labyrinth, which was the publication that the Plaintiffs rely a lot on, that is, the publication that had the article on medical murder in the prison system, the rejection, the reason for the rejection in that case explains a lot about the way the BOP engages in this policy, which is the reason it was kept out was because, as testimony at trial showed, Leavenworth, which is the place from which it was kept out, was very tense at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.507" offset="11826226">It would probably not have been excluded under normal times, the testimony was, but a number of prisoners at the time were upset over the rumors of these so-called murders, and there was, as the warden testified, some real tension among the prisoners over the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.867" offset="11891637">It was a very sensitive issue at the time, particularly because it involved an inmate who had been there at Leavenworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.380" offset="11913684">This was a, if you will, a time, place and manner exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.535" offset="11930298">It was an exclusion by the warden because In his discretion at that time that particular article would have been potentially very disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.430" offset="11965929">That's the kind of discretion that the BOP attempts to protect and the kind of discretion that we think would be at risk if a standard like the Court of Appeals standard were adopted.</text>
