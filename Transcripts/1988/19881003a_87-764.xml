            <text syncTime="99.080" offset="533658">They were reprinted in the text of the intermediate appellate order which reached the contrary conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.452" offset="571170">These facts were, first, that Defendant Riley had leased an over five acre parcel in Pasco County, Florida on which he placed his mobile home and nearby constructed a shed, described by the trial court as a greenhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.879" offset="632924">The greenhouse was some 10 to 20 feet from the mobile home.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.516" offset="647448">The greenhouse, as constructed by the defendant, was enclosed on two sides and open on two sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.253" offset="674406">Trees and shrubbery obscured one of the open sides from view.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.741" offset="696349">The mobile home and one or more other trees obscured the other open side from view from the nearby road.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.868" offset="768865">It does not show... there are six photographs in the record which are mainly concentrated on the mobile home and the greenhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.157" offset="810034">The roof of the greenhouse was corrugated roofing, partly translucent, partly opaque.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.162" offset="845978">There were two openings caused by either removing or not installing the roof panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.066" offset="869697">The open portion was about ten percent of the roof.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.268" offset="882445">A "Do Not Enter" sign was posted in front of the mobile home.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.922" offset="901044">The area containing the mobile home and the greenhouse was enclosed or partially enclosed by a net wire fence.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.611" offset="939810">A Pasco County deputy received a tip about possible drug manufacture on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.681" offset="968127">That deputy and Deputy Gell, a police officer for 14 years, went to look from the road nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.919" offset="993100">They could not see into the greenhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.204" offset="1002191">Gell did not attempt to walk on the property outside of the fenced area to a point where he would be able to see through one of the two open sides of the greenhouse nor did he enter property adjoining the Riley tract to see what he could see from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.629" offset="1063944">Instead, he got a police pilot to fly him over the property in the police helicopter.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.748" offset="1084424">The helicopter circled the greenhouse twice at about 400 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.569" offset="1103650">Gell, who had viewed cannabis some hundred times and some six times from the air, identified by naked eye viewing the tall marijuana plants through the roof openings and through the open sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.079" offset="1157671">He took two pictures of them with a camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.614" offset="1167807">The helicopter then left.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.497" offset="1175330">A warrant was issued on the basis of Gell's affidavit.</text>
