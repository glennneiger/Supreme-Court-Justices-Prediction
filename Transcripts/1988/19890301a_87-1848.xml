            <text syncTime="79.149" offset="459377">This Court in that precedent without dissent tied associational freedom to the Bill of Rights and found protection first for intimate relations central to the concept of personal liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.481" offset="668774">Of course, minors as... as all of us, have personal liberty, but there is nothing in the Constitution which would guarantee purely recreational association.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.023" offset="710884">I think for a city to make such a blanket prohibition would be similar perhaps to the D.C. City... City Council submitting to the mayor the curfew ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.644" offset="841391">What I mean to say is that ordinance would probably not infringe the alleged constitutional protection of social association.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.250" offset="879844">But it would implicate other constitutional protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.320" offset="896144">And for that reason, I think that your hypothetical and perhaps others would be going too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.760" offset="929894">Dance halls do not exhibit the characteristics of intimate associations that this Court has protected in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.514" offset="960928">They are primarily large gatherings.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.382" offset="972317">Mr. Stanglin's testimony in the district court was that it was not unusual for there to be 800 to 1,000 persons in his establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.821" offset="1006067">They are not selective in who they admit to the dance hall, and I think it's reasonable to think that of 800 or 1,000 teenagers, a large percentage are going to be strangers to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.795" offset="1054028">And I think it is not reasonable to compare such a setting or such an atmosphere with, for example, the marital bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.587" offset="1097182">This Court has also recognized constitutional protection in the area of expressive association, in other words, gathering to exercise rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, such things as freedom of speech, religious beliefs and to petition the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.798" offset="1166041">However, the dance hall that is involved in this case is not an association at all in the sense of being an organization with a collective identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.206" offset="1223615">Patrons do not gather at a dance hall primarily to exercise their right of free speech or to petition the government, nor do they primarily go there to exercise religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.199" offset="1279621">So, although minors do enjoy personal liberty to some extent, they do not have this autonomy that Respondents allege in whatever serves them as recreat on.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.673" offset="1325493">I think it would be unwise to give credence to Respondent's suggestion of social associational rights because it would chill the efforts of state and local governments to create age-appropriate categories for the use of municipal facilities or what have you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.516" offset="4768849">Thus, consistent with this Court's analysis in the City of Renton case, the City of Dallas is attacking the juvenile crime problem this one step at a time, and they're doing it in the least intrusive way that they can in this dance hall context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.248" offset="7535844">In any event, the significance, to get back to the point... and... and I do believe this point has been made... that there is no constitutional right even in establishing the spectrum that Justice Brennan mentions, that the far end of that spectrum... he does say at one end you have the compelling state interest, strict scrutiny highest standard, and at the other end you have no constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.065" offset="7643050">Justice O'Connor in the expressive association aspect in the concurring opinion establishes a similar type of scale for expressive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.956" offset="7686622">One end of the scale would be the commercial enterprise, and the other being the surely expressive purpose of an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.412" offset="7728523">That same type of a scale... and if I'm understanding Justice O'Connor's opinion correctly... at the most expressive, pure expressive, end of that scale, the highest constitutional protection is accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.773" offset="7793933">Whereas at the business enterprise end of it, the commercial enterprise, if that's predominantly what's at stake, then only a rational basis is necessary to further ordinance or legislation to pass muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.568" offset="7861120">And I am saying that I believe a social association can be analyzed in that same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.189" offset="7891631">And to take the issue before us now, dance, presents the opportunity to consider what has been thought of as a cultural event and presents then the argument that a compelling state interest should be applied because it is an expressive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.648" offset="7949414">But many things can be imagined that would not fall into that category that you could not seriously argue are expressive, but you can't argue either that unless the state has some reason for denying you the right to do something, that they should be allowed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.610" offset="8029244">The... one problem here is that this case presents something that's entirely different than was presented in Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.881" offset="8062368">Roberts dealt with the traditional classical type of organization with the Jaycees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.285" offset="8083997">Rotary Club did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.071" offset="8095073">The analysis in Roberts... Justice Brennan made the statement, our decisions have recognized two types of association, and he went on to categorize the two types.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.462" offset="8140630">That is a completely accurate statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.247" offset="8151811">There had been no previous decision that really dealt in any sense with a right of social association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.568" offset="8177097">The right that we advocate in this case can be dealt with within the existing parameters of Roberts either on the intimate or on the expressive end by falling within the scale, or the Court could choose to recognize a third category that was simply not presented in Roberts and therefore isn't addressed in Roberts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.276" offset="11443971">And there's no showing that the association is detrimental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.395" offset="11456405">The trial court who ruled in favor of the City made these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.049" offset="11475004">The City has not articulated a precise basis for distinguishing between skating and dancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.136" offset="11499350">The City's argument that the noise levels are higher, the traffic control is a problem, greater neighborhood disruption, more alcohol and drug abuse have no real factual support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.075" offset="11539161">Nevertheless, the trial court said, its witnesses experienced in law enforcement and urban planning insist that a distinction exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.597" offset="11573225">And it is my belief that if you rely upon that, and if that evidence is good enough, then the rational basis test is a fiction because the government can always put somebody on the stand and say I'm experienced in zoning law, and I don't think these kids should be allowed with older kids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.892" offset="11642397">And I can't tell you why.</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.024" offset="11946880">To pick up on... on his quote about being as against the Federal Government I think is appropriate in this case because if this is expressive association, as he claims, clearly as he has just stated, the intent of the constitutional Framers was to protect their expression as against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.890" offset="12034338">And clearly they are not gathering at this dance hall to express the way they dance as opposed to the way the Federal Government might like to have them do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.096" offset="12075194">I think that's the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.114" offset="12087315">He also attacks what he claims is a lack of a good record to support the rational basis, even assuming you get to that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.505" offset="12128797">However, the testimony in the district court of his client indicates that it is not unusual or there to be unwanted sexual overtures at his establishment, this being just for your reference at pages 22 and 46 in... in the statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.967" offset="12202671">There's also testimony from his client that alcohol does slip into his establishment despite his rules against it, that there's rowdiness in his establishment despite his rules against it, and that there are drugs in his establishment despite his attempts to keep them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.261" offset="12275919">I don't think there is this void in the record that he claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.082" offset="12295145">The police department... several police officers who are charged with enforcing these types of regulations testified in the district court that on the one hand, all other things being equal, if they were called to a dance hall on a disturbance, they would expect the mood of the patrons to be much more aggressive than if they were approaching, for example, a movie theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.912" offset="12386469">And the police testified that they've attributed an increase in the crime rate in certain neighborhoods to the fact that there is a dance hall in the neighborhood.</text>
