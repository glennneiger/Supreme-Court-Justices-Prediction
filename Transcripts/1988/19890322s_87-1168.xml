            <text syncTime="6.651" offset="113086">In the first case Commission of Internal Revenue against Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.613" offset="136910">The case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.078" offset="158853">It requires that we construe Section 356(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.833" offset="185811">The Code provides that certain tax-free stock-for-stock exchanges can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.212" offset="211307">However, if such an exchange is accompanied by a cash payment, something the tax practitioners refer to as boot, gain is recognized up to the value of the boot and the question is whether the gain should be treated as capital gain or ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.751" offset="273478">In this case, it is treated as ordinary income if it has the effect of the distribution of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.910" offset="306184">In the opinion filed with the clerk today, we agree with the Fourth Circuit that the determination of whether an exchange has the effect of a dividend should be made by treating the payment of boot as though it came from the acquiring corporation in the context of a redemption immediately following the corporate reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.833" offset="381834">Applying this test, we conclude that the cash payment received by the tax payer in this case is not appropriately characterized as a dividend and that he correctly applied a capital gains rate and that the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals properly sustained his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.077" offset="446827">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.356" offset="459888">Justice Scalia joins all the part three of the Court's opinion, and Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
