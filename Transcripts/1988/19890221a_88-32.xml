            <label>Mr. Carl Valvo</label>
            <text syncTime="47.762" offset="330191">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="50.730" offset="342103">This case is here on certiorari to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.213" offset="359971">The primary issue presented is whether an employer's agreement to pay additional compensation in lieu of vacation is an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan, as the Court below held, or is it a payroll practice outside the scope of ERISA, as the Secretary of Labor concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.377" offset="432591">The facts of the case are as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="76.141" offset="443667">The employer bank had agreed that employees could forego some or all of an annual vacation leave and, instead, receive payments for the unused vacation time.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.809" offset="486404">These payments came from the general assets of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.151" offset="499778">In 1985, two employees of the bank were discharged, each with an accumulation of days they had actually worked instead of taking vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.320" offset="536454">Upon their termination, the bank refused to pay for this time worked, and, subsequently, criminal complaints under the Massachusetts Statute, Section 148, were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.846" offset="582534">Upon report from the trial court to the SJC, the SJC held that the prosecutions under the state statute were preempted by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.859" offset="618583">Now, if the bank's arrangement is a welfare benefit plan, as the Court below held, then employers with common vacation policies like the bank's, may be required to comply with ERISA's elaborate regulatory provisions, with no real corresponding benefit to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.522" offset="697264">If, however, the practice is a payroll practice, as the Secretary of Labor terms it, the states will continue to enforce statutes like Section 148, which have long been proven to be an efficient and effective means of resolving vacation pay claims, which often amount to no more than a few hundred dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.795" offset="786289">If the SJC is correct, then a disappointed employee's sole remedy, with respect to vacation pay, will be to file a federal ERISA action to claim his... his pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.148" offset="855775">Now, whether one views these payments as straight compensation for time worked or as a lump sum amount that aggregates what would have been paid to the employee had he taken vacation, the Secretary's payroll practices regulation controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.342" offset="924529">This regulation was promulgated shortly after the enactment of ERISA, pursuant to express and a quite broad delegation of rule-making power to the Secretary, to carry out the provisions of the statute and to define its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.664" offset="993806">And, I might add that, unlike Justice Scalia perhaps, the Secretary had to both read the statute and deal with reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.379" offset="1028601">He had to make the plan requirements of ERISA work in the real world, so that this payroll practice is a... the regulation is an accommodation of the purposes and history of the statute, as applied to common payroll practices used throughout the nation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl Valvo</label>
            <text syncTime="298.286" offset="1332248">There are several provisions in the enumerated benefits in Taft-Hartley that were also mentioned in ERISA, and some in exactly the same language, some in slightly different language.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.515" offset="1389195">For instance, daycare centers versus childcare centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.748" offset="1402152">It's difficult to assume that Congress meant a different... had a different meaning for some of these terms, just because it used it again in 3(1), than the use of the term in the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.446" offset="1460875">So, I think that it's fair to conclude, as the Secretary did, that Congress was not so much concerned with defining neat boxes of benefits in ERISA that would be in addition to whatever was in the Taft-Hartley enumeration of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.718" offset="1534018">It was just throwing a lot of things into the scope of ERISA, and one of those things was the funded vacation arrangements that Congress was well aware of in the longshore and construction industries.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.530" offset="2629280">He could have discharged them, effective immediately, and paid them the cash value of the unused vacation that they still had.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.104" offset="5595537">But Congress has not clearly stated an intention to, or at least, where the definition of... where the dividing line is, from separating criminal laws, which it seeks to save, and those which it seeks to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.114" offset="5659589">And we think that the presumption in favor of historic police powers, in the absence of a clear statement by Congress, operates here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.470" offset="5689055">In Massachusetts... in Metropolitical Life v. Massachusetts, the Court used that presumption in, in interpreting the insurance... the insurance law exemption from preemption, and it saved the statute for Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.684" offset="5741822">The same presumption has force here, perhaps a fortiori, since criminal law is at least as deserving of, of protection from the presumption as an insurance law would.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.232" offset="6032095">Now, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.802" offset="6106387">I'd like to begin with some of the essentials, which I think have been related to by the Commonwealth in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.282" offset="6144213">First of all, with regard to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.470" offset="6152990">There's no question but that the facts in this case are relatively... I shouldn't say relatively... very meager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.186" offset="6175873">But one important fact, that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts focused on, can be found at page 289 and 290 of its decision, and that fact, and I'll read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.884" offset="6230626">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.291" offset="6232297">"Lastly, the parties agree and appeal, that pursuant to bank policy, employees who accrue unused vacation time, receive a lump sum cash payment, in lieu of unused vacation time, unused time, upon termination of their employment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.393" offset="6292693">We submit, Your Honors, that the SJ... the Supreme Judicial Court was focusing on that specific issue in reaching its decision that this plan was like a severance plan, akin to a severance plan and, therefore, an ERISA welfare benefit plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.674" offset="6445875">Petitioners, including the Solicitor, have focused on a general assets test, to determine whether vacation plan is a general assets, everyday payroll practice, or whether, in fact, it's an employee welfare benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.122" offset="6499582">But, the Secretary of Labor, itself, in one of its own opinion letters, involving American Motors, has found a general assets plan to be a... a general assets vacation-pay plan, to be a severance plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.070" offset="6551409">Now, in that case, which is cited in the Solicitor's brief, and I think it's given reference to in Petitioner's brief, the exercise... it was a voluntary plan, just as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.643" offset="6597698">The employees of American Motors had a right, voluntarily, to set aside time, if they wished, their vacation time, if they wished, for payment upon termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.655" offset="6637718">Now, the Secretary focuses in its brief on the irrevocability of that exercise, and yet, even in that plan, the exercise by the employee wasn't irrevocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.056" offset="6687351">It was also revocable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.306" offset="7308333">I think the solicitor's brief is essentially arguing that most, if not all, general asset plans do not come within the definition of employee welfare benefit plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.932" offset="7450857">And the other words of the regulation involve an employee who's absent while on vacation, or on holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.601" offset="7477502">They used those two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.523" offset="7481264">And these two employees, just as the employees in American Motors, were no longer on vacation, and they were no longer on holiday.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.849" offset="9666564">On the other hand, the only fact pattern, before the court, involved two employees who, upon termination, were compensated for their unused vacation time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.424" offset="9712853">And, that was a stipulation that we arrived at to present the issue before the court, that it would require termination before such payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.841" offset="9746498">And, there's nothing in the record at all, which speaks to the other issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.026" offset="9767187">But, but... to get back, I think to Justice Stevens' question about the deferral nature, and perhaps I... there is something to argue, I think, that any deferred... anytime that vacation time is deferred to a later period of time, and not paid for, until... except in... except in a lump-sum distribution... that that speaks to an employee welfare benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.842" offset="9882544">And, I think that the Secretary's own regulation supports that, because the Secretary's regulation in (b)(3)(1) talks about the type of premium that it considers to be... in the vacation context... that it considers to be a payroll practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.614" offset="9973555">In there it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.348" offset="9976480">"a payment to induce employees to take vacations at a time favorable to the employer for business reasons. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.815" offset="9998423">I think one can argue from that, that the Secretary envisioned a situation where there was a deferral of vacation time for lump-sum payment that wasn't required or induced by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.903" offset="10050773">And then, at that later time, with cash out... focusing mostly on cash out... that this would speak to more of the plan issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.319" offset="10112422">If I remember the facts of that situation, an employee could apply for monies, based on hardship, very similar to a 401(K) arrangement, and "hardship" is a word that's subject to a great deal of difference of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.486" offset="10173026">But there could... there were ways employees could draw from their account, if you will, during the term of their employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.957" offset="10303011">I'd like to turn to... one argument the Commonwealth makes in their brief... in their reply brief... not here, with regard to vacation being equated with wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.479" offset="10401022">The Commonwealth makes reference to bankruptcy preference... the bankruptcy preference code, Section 507.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.523" offset="10425264">And in its reply brief states that vacations there are treated as wages, and since they're treated as wages there, they must, or should be treated here as wages as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.127" offset="10475628">Now, the Commonwealth has conveniently used ellipses in quoting that statute, because the word next to 507, is the word "severance", and it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.622" offset="10529649">"that for the purpose of 507, severance payments shall be equated with wages, as well. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.199" offset="10543964">Now, since it's acknowledged by this Court that severance plans are already seen as an employee welfare benefit plan, Section 507 gives the Commonwealth no help, whatsoever, with regard to the argument of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.959" offset="10598926">Finally, the Commonwealth argues that there's no administration necessary, with regard to this plan, and attempts to argue, I think, that the Fort Halifax case... decision of this Court... is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.328" offset="10660471">But, that, as the Supreme Judicial Court found, is not all true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.060" offset="10679383">A plan such as this one, which is again, very much akin to a severance pay plan, requires a great deal of administration by an employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.226" offset="11044053">You know, that certain types of benefits... most benefits, for that matter, if not all benefits under ERISA, aren't taxed in one way or another, are subject to a favorable tax treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.034" offset="11083236">In that sense, I suppose, a watch could be taxed, if it's construed to be wages and not a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.313" offset="11112389">But, I think it was mostly concerned with promises not kept, in the area of money... actual compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.888" offset="11134645">I suppose it would depend on the cost of the watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.716" offset="11150005">Back to the administration issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.713" offset="11181979">The plan that is at issue in this case creates a periodic demand upon the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.897" offset="11202668">If you will accept, as we believe, that this plan paid only upon termination, and those are the only facts before the Supreme Judicial Court, at least then, with every termination, there was a possibility that the employer would have to make some determination, after eligibility, to make a payoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.969" offset="11279050">So, I think there's clearly enough administration here, to bring the program squarely within ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.230" offset="11308098">Today, the Commonwealth does not make an, an argument before this Court, with regard to the question of ERISA welfare benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.332" offset="11384480">Now, if the plan is an ERISA welfare benefit plan, as we say it is, I can't see any argument, whatsoever, that the Commonwealth statute doesn't relate to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.875" offset="11426590">Now, the Commonwealth statute is a clear effort to enforce the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.592" offset="11441532">It attempts to enforce it by a criminal action, and in my experience, many employers are more concerned about a criminal finding than they are about paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.417" offset="11476849">No one wants to be found guilty of a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.103" offset="11487507">So, clearly, the Commonwealth is attempting to enforce a welfare benefit plan, with regard to its Section 149... 148, 149.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.225" offset="11524079">And they've just as much, admitted that here, today, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.910" offset="11534737">Secondly, in its brief, again, it says that there's no restitution available, which is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.408" offset="11560755">There's restitution available through the Massachusetts Criminal Court system, as there is for many criminal court systems, if not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.969" offset="11586982">And, and there's a case that I brought with me today, or to cite, because we did not have chance to file a reply to their reply, which is Commonwealth v. Nawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.635" offset="11629718">That's a 394 Massachusetts decision, page one, which talks about a criminal... the right of a criminal court to grant restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.820" offset="11658453">So, clearly, an individual who was pursuing this statute, would have a right to restitution, as well as a right to enforce the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.300" offset="11692307">Enough, I think, is said about "relates to".</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.581" offset="11701502">And, that leaves a question of general applicability, whether this is a generally applicable criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.296" offset="11740268">There's really very little I can add to the questions already raised by the Court about that, that phrase... that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.682" offset="11785826">First of all, to the extent again, as we submit, that the plan before us is, in fact, an ERISA welfare benefit plan... this statute squarely deals with employee welfare benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.990" offset="11839115">It might say wages, which are vacation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.739" offset="11854057">But, to the extent that it deals with vacation benefits, is absolutely and squarely directed at a welfare benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.062" offset="11887390">I don't see any way around that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.656" offset="11893764">Now, to the extent that it also deals with wages... there's nothing to say that the statute isn't valid as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.341" offset="11920513">And, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts did not find it to be invalid as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.730" offset="11938067">They found it invalid only to the extent that it reached employee welfare benefit plans, which were, in fact, welfare benefit plans under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.070" offset="11971400">So, from that point of view, I think the statute is directed right at... right at an ERISA cover topic, and, therefore, invalid to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.801" offset="12010374">To the extent that it is... to the extent that the Commonwealth values that are generally applicable in any sense... again, under that analysis, anything would be generally applicable, because it applies to everyone within a specific group or classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.403" offset="12072755">A state... a state could draw a 15-person statute, and I'm not saying an inappropriate one, and say, this would be criminal if any one of these 15 people commit this crime, and it would apply, generally, to all those individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.163" offset="12131791">But, that certainly does not make the statute generally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.334" offset="12144435">Additionally, ERISA really chose... the Congress, when it promulgated ERISA, really chose a very comprehensive scheme for enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.362" offset="12184559">And, it shows for participants and beneficiaries, a civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.342" offset="12208487">It did not choose for them a criminal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.654" offset="12217786">So, again, it shows its disfavor with regard to criminal remedies in that same area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.105" offset="12239520">The definition of "generally applicable" that the Supreme Judicial Court found, which I think is the definition held by most people, is a statute which applies to the public, in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.817" offset="12314440">And, by creating such a statute, what the Congress, I think, was intending to do, was to say, if you steal from a plan... if you're an individual, and you steal from a plan... don't look to ERISA to protect you against prosecution for stealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.934" offset="12382880">Anybody who steals can be prosecuted, and stealing from a plan does not protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.666" offset="12401793">But, Congress certainly did not want the states to be able to promulgate specific laws and hide them, with... within general language, that would apply to ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.570" offset="12441395">And finally, I disagree strongly with the Commonwealth argument that this exception should be read broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.441" offset="12472846">It should be read narrowly, such as any exception to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.205" offset="12487997">But I do agree that the exception is subject to a conflict analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.750" offset="12506178">In other words, if it is a generally applicable law, it still must pass the test as to whether it is in conflict with ERISA as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.702" offset="12533973">And here, it clearly is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.216" offset="12540033">First of all, as I said before, ERISA set up a civil enforcement requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.059" offset="12559364">The courts discussed that in a number of recent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.480" offset="12569081">This is criminal... certainly, something not chosen, and clearly not chosen on purpose by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.662" offset="12597816">Therefore, it's in conflict in that it is criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.818" offset="12610355">It's in conflict in terms of the payment procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.708" offset="12621953">Under ERISA, you have approximately 90 days to pay a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.190" offset="12635850">Under the Mass statute, it's immediately upon discharge, that day, and approximately six days later... the payroll period later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.407" offset="12664794">So there's a second conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.984" offset="12675034">And, the third conflict, and a very extreme conflict, at that, is that this statute is directed at any officer of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.949" offset="12706903">It need not be an individual who had any involvement, whatsoever, with the ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.947" offset="12730936">The statute doesn't require any involvement at all, just the names and number of officers, including the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.239" offset="12760088">And then, these individuals have personal liability for that plan... for the payment of that plan, both personal and criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.378" offset="12792689">ERISA certainly did not choose personal liability for people not related, in any fashion, to the plan at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.718" offset="12826022">And, it certainly didn't choose criminal responsibility for those individuals, except under specific problems, such as disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.747" offset="12858100">So, again, that's the third conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.057" offset="12867400">In closing, let me again, go back to the primary question I think I've been asked by this Court, with the few minutes I have remaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.849" offset="12914524">That's all it will take, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.942" offset="12922884">And, that is that, "vacation benefits" are a word used squarely within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.128" offset="12947648">No question, whatsoever, about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.064" offset="12955380">It's used twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.798" offset="12958306">It's used in 3(1)(a) and 3(1)(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.564" offset="12965411">In 3(1)(b), the word is "pooled vacation benefits".</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.093" offset="12979517">Just the type of benefits that the solicitor, I think, suggests, and petitioner certainly suggests, are the only types of benefits precluded... included within ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.995" offset="13015148">If that were true, 3(1)(a), as it applied to vacation benefits, would be superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.681" offset="13033852">There would be no reason in the world to have those words.</text>
