            <label>Mr. Patrick F. McCartan</label>
            <text syncTime="13.224" offset="196674">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.276" offset="212870">This case presents two questions for consideration by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.829" offset="231051">The first and principal question is whether upon termination of a pension plan the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, ERISA, requires the payment of subsidized early retirement benefits before any surplus plan assets may revert to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.208" offset="304612">We submit that ERISA imposes no such requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.660" offset="318404">But if the Court should disagree, then it would be necessary for the Court to decide whether the court below, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, abused its discretion in reaching and deciding the damage issue, when that issue was not considered by the district court and was not raised, briefed or argued in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.073" offset="392070">The factual background against which the Court will decide this question is relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.208" offset="412550">The Respondents are six former salaried employees of the Petitioner, of the Lynchburg Foundry Company, formerly a previously... excuse me, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.600" offset="462182">They were participants in a salaried employees retirement plan, which was a tax-qualified, single employer, defined benefit plan funded entirely by Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.974" offset="503665">Under the terms of the plan, normal retirement benefits became payable at age 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.878" offset="531250">Employees became entitled to actuarially reduced early retirement benefits at age 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.699" offset="554551">And employees became entitled to subsidized early retirement benefits if they had attained age 62 and completed 30 years of service at the time they severed their employment with Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.106" offset="600213">This benefit was subsidized in the sense that there was no actuarial reduction for the early commencement for the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.212" offset="636576">In 1983, Petitioner sold the foundry, severed the employment of the Respondents, and terminated the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.301" offset="668968">Employees who had satisfied the requirements for receiving normal or subsidized early retirement benefits, received those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.455" offset="697598">All employees who were ineligible for such benefits received their normal retirement benefit, payable at age 65, based upon their completed years of service on the date of plan termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.814" offset="747022">In other words, the actuarial value of the normal retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.833" offset="767084">The Respondents were in this latter group.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.285" offset="776906">Five had completed 30 years of service but had not attained age 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.689" offset="798535">One had 28 years of service and was only age 61 at the time of plan termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.426" offset="825493">Prior to the actual termination of the plan, Mead requested and received from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation a Notice of Sufficiency of Assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.668" offset="866453">The IRS subsequently issued a favorable determination letter indicating the termination of the plan did not affect its tax-qualified status.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.756" offset="902816">Having satisfied all liabilities of the plan, Mead then took a reversion of approximately $10.7 million, as provided by the terms of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.379" offset="945239">This suit followed, Respondents claiming that Mead should have paid subsidized early retirement benefits before any surplus plan assets could revert to the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.270" offset="988811">On cross-motions for partial summary judgment, the district court held that the Petitioner was not required to make payment of such benefits because they were not accrued benefits within the meaning of ERISA and the Respondents had not satisfied all terms and conditions of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.464" offset="1057565">The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that upon plan termination, ERISA required payment of these subsidies even if those benefits were not accrued benefits within the meaning of the statute and even though Respondents had not satisfied all conditions under the plan for the receipt of such benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.760" offset="1134783">For its sole statutory authority, the court of appeals relied on Section 4044(a)(6) of ERISA, which ranks the order in which assets must be allocated upon plan termination among six categories, the last being the payment of all other benefits under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.208" offset="1220569">In construing this category to create a substantive right to recover subsidized early retirement benefits, the court below relied upon Amato against Western Union, where the Second Circuit that Congress did not intend to limit this allegation category to accrued benefits within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.020" offset="1299877">But, instead, intended that, if assets were available, they should be paid to meet the participant's benefit expectations under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.478" offset="1341673">The court below then calculated the amount due each Respondent by taking a five percent actuarial reduction for each year that the individual is under the early retirement age at the time of plan termination.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.686" offset="1498512">Could you say they are accrued but not yet vested until they are 62?</text>

            <text syncTime="344.757" offset="1522754">To begin with, a benefit can be earned only under the terms of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.510" offset="1541771">If it is a benefit which is mandated by ERISA to be paid, it must be an accrued benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.231" offset="1568625">Under the terms of this plan, there were two conditions for the receipt of early retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.485" offset="1593702">The employee had to have 30 years of service and reach age 62 in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.289" offset="1616899">Now, once you make either the age or service expectations of the participants, rather than the terms of the plan, the touchstone of liability, there is no way for determining what the obligations of the plan are, and I submit there is no reason for disregarding the terms of one condition and not another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.262" offset="5084811">But I think it's important to keep in mind here, Justice Scalia, that Congress in writing this statute was endeavoring to embrace and to enforce the terms of these plans, not to rewrite them or to disregard them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.022" offset="5147818">And I submit if the Congress in this allocation category intended to create a whole new category of substantive rights based upon benefit expectations, it would have said so in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.324" offset="5269026">Now, the court below found some comfort in the Second Circuit's interpretation of the legislative history of Section 4044(a), the interpretation that the Second Circuit put on the legislative history in the Amato case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.768" offset="5342796">There the court attached a great deal of significance to the fact that the adjective accrued was eliminated from the fourth category of the House bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.262" offset="5396818">But the fourth category of the House bill is in no way an analog for Category 6 of Section 4044(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.320" offset="5444987">The closest analog to Category 6 in the predecessor bills was Section 112(d)(2) of the House bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.628" offset="5486261">That was a provision for the payment of other benefits that vest upon... not that vest, that are payable upon plan termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.381" offset="5521265">The first indication that I can see in the legislative history for a predecessor to Category 6 is in the Administration's recommendations to the conferees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.289" offset="5564942">There, the Administration recommended that there be a category of this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.743" offset="5582705">And the bill emerges from conference with this catchall provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.497" offset="5605693">So, elimination of the adjective accrued from a section in the predecessor House bill that really is not the closest analog to Category (a)(6) proves very little.</text>
