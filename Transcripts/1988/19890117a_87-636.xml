            <text syncTime="67.442" offset="403420">The issue before the Court this morning in this case is whether a federal employee who has been injured by his union's breach of the duty of fair representation may bring an action to redress those injuries in district court or, put another way, whether Congress intended a union operating in the federal sector to receive immunity, complete immunity, from such lawsuits, an immunity which has never been permitted in any other national labor relations statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.378" offset="523165">It is our view that the congressional grant of exclusive representation powers to the union in the federal sector, coupled with the unreviewable discretion of the general counsel of the FLRA here, mandate jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction, in the district court just as exactly those same factors compelled jurisdiction in this court's decision in Vaca v. Sipes 20 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.449" offset="867459">I believe that's the doctrine announced... enunciated by the Court in Vaca v. Sipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.519" offset="891805">And I think that the reason for that is that the Court recognized in Vaca that the administrative remedies... the focus which the administrative agency has in fashioning remedies, even given an unfair labor practice finding, is a remedy which isn't necessarily suited to redress the wrongs done to the individual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.955" offset="1009461">For example... and the facts here I think provide a cogent demonstration of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.459" offset="1031508">Here the administrative remedy fashioned by the agency, by the Authority's general counsel, in reaching a settlement, a settlement reached, it bears noting, over the objection of the charging party, over the objection of the injured employee... the administrative remedy reached here was to achieve a settlement with the union which required the union to post a notice on its bulletin board saying we're not going to repeat the conduct which was wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.913" offset="1161285">And that administrative remedy may well have been furthering the institutional goals of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, as similar notice-posting remedies further the institutional goals which the NLRB has in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.440" offset="1223456">And the problem addressed by the Court in Vaca is that that administrative remedy, given the strength of the duty of fair representation doctrine... that administrative remedy does not provide any relief... that administrative focus does not provide any relief for the injured employee who is wronged by his union.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.664" offset="1588334">And I think that's the contextual setting in which Congress was passing the CSRA here, and that's what Congress was looking to when it said it wanted to make federal sector labor relations more like the private sector.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.573" offset="2612021">The union... the majority representative has exclusive access to the bargaining mechanism, which may be less significant in the federal sector, but it has the same access, exclusive access, to the arbitration mechanism which is so very troubling in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.433" offset="2675446">Should the union decide for arbitrary, bad faith or discriminatory reasons not to take a case to arbitration, what remedy does the employee have?</text>
            <text syncTime="646.724" offset="2720586">And is the administrative focus of the institution with the... the FLRA, that is... with the institutional goals which it has in fashioning unit-wide remedies, as opposed to individual remedies... is that institutional focus sufficient to allow us to say that the duty of fair representation in the federal sector is less significant and less worthy of protection than in the private sector?</text>
            <text syncTime="678.010" offset="2845765">It's our feeling that had Congress wanted to depart from the principles of Vaca, the reasonable thing for Congress to have done would be to say something about it.</text>

          <turn speaker="h_stephan_gordon" startTime="835.243" stopTime="1046.411">
            <label>Mr. H. Stephan Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="835.243" offset="3474689">Mr. Chief Justices and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="843.147" offset="3506245">In this case the Court is once again called upon to decide whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute which does not expressly provide for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.407" offset="3559325">And in recent years, but starting long before the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act, this Court has held in a considerable body of case law that the creation of an implied private cause of action to enforce a particular statute... a statutory duty is the function of the Congress and not of the Court, and that the ultimate issue before the Court in deciding this issue is whether the Congress did, in fact, intend to create such a private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.092" offset="3686072">To discern this congressional intent, the Court has said it will look to the language of the statute, the structure of the statute, the legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.234" offset="3730584">And unless a congressional intent can be discerned from these factors or from some other relevant source, the essential predicate for implying a private remedy simply does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.160" offset="3786277">The Petitioner asserts in his brief that the Court's task in ascertaining this matter in this case is simplified because the Congress modeled the Civil Service Reform Act on the Labor Management Relations Act in the private sector, where the Court long ago fashioned a private remedy for the judicially developed doctrine of the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.894" offset="3893275">And Petitioner asserts that Congress, therefore, must be held to have incorporated this private cause of action into Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.869" offset="3937161">This argument, I respectfully submit, is misdirected.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.087" offset="3958059">I think from the outset it must be emphasized that the Civil Service Reform Act is not an extension of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.943" offset="4001422">It is, indeed, a new law designed to regulate for the first time labor-management relations in the federal government, labor-management relations, incidentally, with problems and issues which are unique unto themselves and which differ materially from those to be found in the private sector and particularly wherein the role of the union is far more circumscribed than the role of labor organizations in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.580" offset="4123988">And moreover, while the Labor Management Relations Act may well have acted as a backdrop to the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act, the Civil Service Reform Act is far more closely related to the executive orders which governed labor-management relations in the federal government for 18 years prior to the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.779" offset="4224821">And, indeed, the language of the duty of fair representation which is at issue here is taken almost in haec verba from the executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.468" offset="4263587">Indeed, if the Civil Service Reform Act is related to anything, it is a codification of the executive orders rather than the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.411" offset="4319280">I must say I've never heard a union argue this before, but it's... it's an interesting [inaudible] to hear from that side.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.036" offset="4361807">Now, with respect to the language and structure of the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act, the Act differs materially from the Labor Management Relations Act, and while there are certainly some similarities between the two acts, the differences far outweigh the similarities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.282" offset="4446757">But with respect to the duty of fair representation, which is the issue before the Court today, this difference is particularly cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.155" offset="4486254">Thus, unlike in the private sector, the Congress here expressly treated with a duty of fair representation, which was never done in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.612" offset="4528155">And it did so by expressly codifying the duty into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.516" offset="4555740">And moreover, even more importantly, it expressly provided an administrative... administrative enforcement scheme including an effective remedy for the breach of such duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.474" offset="4807561">What is one of them, Your Honor, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.459" offset="4815502">The absence of the 301 section, yes, is certainly one of the considerations and a consideration which the Court took into great consideration in... in Vaca.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.985" offset="4873598">And I, I respectfully submit, Justice White, that if there is only one leg of Vaca remaining, namely, the unreviewable power of the general counsel to dismiss charges and not issue complaints, that this would not warrant an inference that Congress intended to create a private cause of action when the remainder of the statute makes it so eminently clear that Congress, indeed, wanted to limit the... the role of the judiciary in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.141" offset="5014241">I think what the Congress has done here is that it picked up the very pieces that were missing in the private sector in Steele and in Syres, and it injected them into this statute in order to prevent and foreclose the necessity of judicial... of a judicial private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.305" offset="5098878">Nor is the language of the structure of the legislative history of the statute uninformative regarding judicial involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.030" offset="5145794">Quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.898" offset="5153317">The... Section 7123 very specifically limits the courts' intervention to three instances: one, that an aggrieved party... party aggrieved by a final order of the Authority may petition in the appropriate circuit court for review of the Authority's final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.776" offset="5228759">Secondly, the Authority itself may petition an appropriate circuit court for enforcement of its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.465" offset="5259583">And the district courts come into play only in one instance, namely, in the third instance whereupon the issuance of a complaint by the general counsel, the Authority may petition United States district court for temporary injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.559" offset="5319874">These are the only instances in which Congress has provided any judicial intervention in the enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.312" offset="5350908">And as I said before, Congress certainly was aware... Congress certainly must have been aware that the existence of 301 in the Labor Management Relations Act which empowered the district courts to enforce labor-management collective bargaining agreements, that this was an intensely... intensely practical consideration, if I may use the words of Vaca, for maintaining a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.517" offset="5471698">And yet, the Congress, when a somewhat similar provision was proposed, specifically rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.372" offset="5507120">Moreover, it left it to the... with the... not only rejected it, but it transferred the duties which district courts had under 301 directly to the Federal--</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.882" offset="5569187">Labor Relations Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.065" offset="5573889">Thus, for example, where... in the private sector under 301 federal courts, of course, will review arbitration awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.403" offset="5603250">When this was proposed during the enactment of this law, the Congress rejected it and placed this power into the hands of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, indeed, a nonreviewable power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.628" offset="5652152">And I am sure these compromises were not accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.199" offset="5682454">This was not done by any oversight by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.901" offset="5693321">These... this limitation of the judicial function was the product of extensive debate and of legislative compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.273" offset="5726757">Now, with respect to the legislative history, which is, of course, another consideration, as I've mentioned, which the board... which the Court will take into consideration, I must agree with my brother that there is, indeed, a paucity of legislative history which is directed directly to the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.907" offset="5837308">And Petitioner asserts that this very paucity leads to the inference that Congress must have intended to include the private cause of action which is prevalent in the private sector under the judicially developed doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.802" offset="5904912">Again, I think this kind of an argument is misplaced because the legislative history certainly is not silent regarding the way this Act is meant to be administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.097" offset="5974085">It... the legislative history may be sparse with respect to the duty of fair representation, but it is quite specific regarding the administration and the enforcement scheme of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.221" offset="6018597">I've already spoken, of course, to the legislative compromise regarding the limited judicial involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.392" offset="6047228">And in this context, the House report specifically said that it is the Federal Labor Relations Authority which shall make the final decision regarding the issuance of unfair labor practice complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.134" offset="6102189">And the only matters specifically referred to in Section 7123, which I just mentioned, shall be judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.574" offset="6143985">Similarly, the Senate report also said that all complaints of unfair labor practices that cannot be resolved by the parties shall be filed with the FLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.798" offset="6188916">And the conference committee which rejected the... which rejected the proposal to include a similar... a... a... a clause somewhat similar to Section 301 also said that these matters shall come to the... for the consideration first of the FLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.145" offset="6274284">In the face of this congressional intent to create a comprehensive and administrative enforcement scheme, I submit it is difficult, indeed, to attribute to the Congress an intent to incorporate by silence a private cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.244" offset="6674689">But in all other respects, the Authority has very broad authority, if I may use that term, to fashion adequate remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.100" offset="6710111">And in the light of this, as I say, it... it is very difficult to attribute to the Congress an intent, to incorporate by silence a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.990" offset="6757654">Indeed, the result of this would be that an individual employee could completely bypass not only the substantive and procedural provisions of the Act, but also he could bypass the very agency which the Congress has created to administer this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.488" offset="6831632">And in the light of the decisions of this Court as recently as a year ago in U.S. v.

I submit that such a remedy could not be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.286" offset="6934868">In conclusion, I only want to say that as in the private sector, the duty of fair representation is alive and well in the federal sector and serves in the words of Vaca v. Sipes as a bulwark to prevent arbitrary union conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.148" offset="6998294">However, the injection of a private cause of action to enforce the duty would, indeed, circumvent the congressional intent to create a comprehensive and integrated administrative enforcement remedial scheme and might well create the duplication of litigation and inconsistent remedies which the Congress intended to avoid and which this Court has cautioned against.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="1753.538" offset="7147819">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.164" offset="7198287">Virtually the whole of Petitioner's case rests on the assertion that just as there is a private right of action for breach of the duty of fair representation under the RLA and the NLRA, there surely must also be an implied right of action under the CSRA in the federal sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.923" offset="7261399">Like the Respondent union, the government believes that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.042" offset="7273833">I want to summarize why we think the evidence is simply not sufficient for Petitioners to sustain their claim that the 1978 Congress that enacted the CSRA intended to authorize suits against unions for breach of the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.004" offset="7337676">The principle factors that this Court's decisions rely on as counting against any implied right of action are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.158" offset="7366307">The statutory language is duty imposing rather than right creating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.360" offset="7379159">The statute, far from failing to address remedies, expressly sets up an elaborate remedial scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.715" offset="7408521">There is no evidence in the legislative history of any intent to create an implied right of action, and the legislative history in fact reflects a commitment of collective bargaining agreement disputes to the FLRA and not the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.706" offset="7460556">But I want to focus my argument on why it is wrong to suggest that Congress must have meant to borrow the implied right of action from the NLRA, as explained in Vaca v. Sipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.498" offset="7507681">To begin with, there is no mention of Vaca or of any private sector analogue in the statute or the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.485" offset="7535580">It was from the pre-1978 federal sector labor law, the executive order, that the express provision imposing the duty of fair representation along with the unfair labor practice remedy was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.475" offset="7583541">Under the executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.411" offset="7591273">Respondent had the same duty of fair representation rights and Petitioner had... and Petitioner had the same administrative remedy as he has here, though without judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.719" offset="7632547">In fact, there are also affirmative reasons to think that Congress did not intend the private sector analogy in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.956" offset="7665461">It's worth noting first that if there was a borrowing from the NLRA, it's significant that it seems to have been a very carefully limited borrowing, because the CSRA took the duty which was only implied in the private sector and made it express, but it didn't take the right which was also only implied under the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.088" offset="7754068">But in any event, the... the and analogy to the NLRA remedial scheme simply does not fit well with the CSRA scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.725" offset="7784579">The... the two statutes are sufficiently different in crucial respects, both substantive and remedial, that the rationale of this Court's decision in Vaca does not carry over in significant degree into the federal setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.085" offset="7837974">First, in the NLRA context, Vaca noted the private right of action was found to be implied in the statute before there was any administrative enforcement mechanism, and there was no evidence of a congressional intent later to preempt that judicially recognized right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.927" offset="7901399">In the FLRA context, the question is not one of congressional displacement of a preexisting right of action for there was no right of action prior to 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.219" offset="7942568">The question rather is of congressional intent to create the right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.337" offset="7959077">And in the CSRA setting, the administrative enforcement scheme was created in the very same act that contains the duty, a key basis for both Vaca and Steele, therefore, namely, the absence of... of an administrative remedy is missing in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.181" offset="8018428">Vaca also emphasized a closely related practical aspect of that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.434" offset="8039430">Most duty of fair representation cases involve questions about labor contract negotiating positions or the handling of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.773" offset="8072762">But Vaca pointed out that those matters are generally outside the jurisdiction of the NLRB and therefore outside its expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.510" offset="8103691">The situation is quite different in the federal sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.831" offset="8116961">The FLRA does have jurisdiction to resolve negotiability disputes, and it also has jurisdiction to review the arbitration awards that result from grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.854" offset="8161056">Those matters, therefore, are already within the authority of the FLRA; and it makes good sense for Congress to have relied on the agency's expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.508" offset="8195747">Vaca rested as well on the idea that the private right of action serves as a necessary counterweight to the union's power to strip employees of preexisting rights and forms of redress, but in the federal sector, unions do not have anything like that kind of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.985" offset="8265650">Perhaps most important, the CSRA expressly provides that a labor contract cannot strip federal employees of their appeal rights under statute or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.110" offset="8306088">In addition, while in the private sector recognition of an exclusive bargaining representative deprives individual employees of their right to make individual contracts with the employer, in the federal sector, most employees do not lose any such right because they are not employed pursuant to contract in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.422" offset="8379335">They are appointed under terms set by statute and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.524" offset="8395740">And the matters that are actually determined by labor contracts are themselves far more limited in the federal sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.379" offset="8423221">Those matters do not include wages, hours or any of the matters covered by certain regulations or the broad statutory management rights provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.235" offset="8458643">Finally, Vaca stressed that employee suits against employers for breach of the... of collective bargaining agreements are already in court under Section 301 of the LMRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.626" offset="8504201">And those suits typically require as a precondition to upsetting the finality of an arbitration award that the employee show that the union representing him breached the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.066" offset="8549967">The issue, as Vaca said, will therefore already be resolved in court, and it makes sense to ensure that relief can be had against the union for its share of the harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.206" offset="8590509">Again, the federal setting is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.591" offset="8604093">There is no analogue to Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.360" offset="8615169">Instead, in the situation addressed by Vaca, after compulsory arbitration, an employee may challenge the arbitral award only before the FLRA, and there is generally judicial review of FLRA decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.453" offset="8671489">Thus, a private right of action in the federal sector cannot be supported as an adjunct to an employee/employer case that is a already in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.536" offset="8779845">And... and in an unfair labor practice proceeding, there would eventually be judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.722" offset="8796563">In fact, recognizing a private right of action would run counter to the decision by Congress to keep collective bargaining agreement disputes out of the courts, except where they are tied up with unfair labor practice questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.196" offset="8846509">As Delcostello noted, most duty of fair representation claims involving grievances require as a precondition to relief that the employee show not only that the union breached the duty, but also that the employer breached the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.622" offset="8900217">Thus, if the courts were to recognize the private right of action that Petitioner requests, other than through an unfair labor practice proceeding, they would be addressing precisely the... the collective bargaining agreement questions that Congress decided to keep out of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.799" offset="8960925">For those reasons, we think that there is no sufficient reason to believe that the 1978 Congress intended to borrow the private sector enforcement scheme as a supplement to the administrative scheme it set forth expressly in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.892" offset="9017245">The judgment of the court of appeals should, therefore, be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Duffy</label>
            <text syncTime="2229.831" offset="9052981">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.466" offset="9071580">The point made by the Solicitor General's Office is that... and by the union is that the role... the role of the union may well be circumscribed somewhat in the federal labor relations scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.732" offset="9160605">That role... the critical difference is that that role has to do with the union's relationship with the employing agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.373" offset="9207208">The union, as I think everyone recognizes, has less power than in the private sector with regard to certain issues of bargaining which would normally be reserved in the private sector for the adversarial parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.084" offset="9278052">What the union's argument ignores are what we feel are the crucial similarities between the statute and those are the similarities which we believe are the underpinning of the Court's decision in Vaca.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.677" offset="9336357">And those similarities again: exclusive representation and unreviewable discretion of the general counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.248" offset="9366659">The fact that there's not a Section 301 direct analogue or analogue of any sort in the Civil Service Reform Act is not, we believe... doesn't advance the inquiry before the Court significantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.792" offset="9436876">And the reason for that is, after Vaca, the Court has recognized in Delcostello that the basis for the duty of fair representation is not Section 301, but the need for the duty of fair representation is implied from the structure of the entire collective bargaining framework, which grants such exclusive powers to the majority representative, even over the most unwilling minority, grants exclusive access to the arbitration mechanisms and may not have an adequate administrative remedy through the FLRA or the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.107" offset="9618062">And those we think are the... the underpinnings of the Vaca decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.177" offset="9642408">The duty of fair representation is implied as a necessary implication once those sorts of powers are granted to a majority representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.949" offset="9681487">We have to put something in the system that assures that there will be an adequate remedy when the majority representative abuses its power or abdicates its position as the representative, which happened here below when the union told the employee we're not going to consider the merits of your arbitration because we're bound by what we did in our previous arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.600" offset="9784096">There's no indication in passing the CSRA that Congress evinced any more or any reluctance to have judicial review of FLRA actions than of NLRB actions in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.245" offset="9862672">Section 7123, with the exception regarding arbitrability, is essentially what we have in Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.934" offset="9901438">We have appellate court review in the... in the federal circuit courts of appeal for those sorts of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.921" offset="9929337">Even the exception with regard to arbitrability, going in the first instance to the FLRA... even that exception is not the case where we have unfair labor practices, and those are reviewable just as they are reviewable in the private sector model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.799" offset="9996837">So, there's no indication from the legislative history that Congress was dissatisfied with the national labor relations system or wanted less judicial review than what we have long experience with in the... in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.559" offset="10059949">The union makes the point that the Federal Labor Relations Authority has broad remedial powers which may well include back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.520" offset="10131734">We... I think that everyone recognizes that the Authority, in fact, does have broad remedial powers.</text>
